This strategy has cleaned and improved SaveService cohesion.\nWith this in mind, I would recommend creating a new class: SampleSaveConfigurationConfig , and moving the following methods:\n\nsetAssertions\nsetResponseHeaders\ngetVarCount\nsetFileName\nsetSuccess\ngetXmlPi\ngetDelimiter\nsetRequestHeaders\nsetAssertionResultsFailureMessage\nsetEncoding\nsetBytes\nsetTime\nsetSamplerData\nsetDataType\nsetThreadName\nsetVarCount\nsetFieldNames\nsetSubresults\nsetHostname\nsetSampleCount\nsetDelimiter\nsetIdleTime\nsetUrl\nsetThreadCounts\nsetConnectTime\nsetTimestamp\nsetDefaultTimeStampFormat\nsetCode\nsetAsXml\nsetMessage\nsetLatency\nsetResponseData\nsetDefaultDelimiter\nsetLabel\nsetFormatter\n\n\nfrom the SampleSaveConfiguration.\nThose parameters accessed by an instance variable in the SampleSaveConfiguration.\nMoreover, the orthogonality is the design would be enhanced.\n\nWhat do you think about that?", "id": 199826, "time": "2017-07-16T14:23:23Z", "creator": "lemesmachado@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-07-16T14:23:23Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61309, "text": "Thanks for proposal, but approach seems to theorical for me and we have to make some choices regarding our time.\nUnless you propose a PR and impact does not break all plugins , I doubt we will move on this.\nClosing as WONTFIX.\n\nThank you", "count": 1, "id": 200596, "time": "2017-09-02T19:15:22Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2017-09-02T19:15:22Z", "is_private": false}]
