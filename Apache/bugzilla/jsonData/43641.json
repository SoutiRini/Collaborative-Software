So\nsomething like\n\n   <Membership className=\"org.apache.catalina.tribes.membership.McastService\"\n               bind=\"123.123.123.123\"\n               address=\"228.0.0.4\"\n               port=\"45564\"/>\n\ncauses a broken cluster.\nThe reason for this is that in the case that the bind parameter is set the \nMulticastSocket is bound to the multicast interface. This is wrong as it causes\nthe respective udp socket to be bound to this interface which stops multicast\nfrom working (tested on Linux and Solaris). It can be tried to bind the\nMulticastSocket to the multicast address itself. This does not work on all\nplatforms. In case it does not work it can be ignored silently and the\nMulticastSocket only binds to the port. The attached patch fixes this."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "attachment_id": 20995, "is_private": false, "id": 109424, "time": "2007-10-17T07:59:25Z", "bug_id": 43641, "creation_time": "2007-10-17T07:59:25Z", "text": "Created attachment 20995\nPatch against 6.0.14"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 20999\nFormatted patch", "attachment_id": 20999, "bug_id": 43641, "id": 109434, "time": "2007-10-17T10:58:54Z", "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-10-17T10:58:54Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "pr@objektpark.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 109435, "time": "2007-10-17T11:12:28Z", "bug_id": 43641, "creation_time": "2007-10-17T11:12:28Z", "text": "OK, can we please add if(log.isInfoEnabled) before the log statements.\n\nI think also the after Exception the log level is warn and not info!
