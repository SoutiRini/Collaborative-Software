Oracle has provided a repair-in-place tool for Javadoc that cannot be easily interpreted, but is urging developers to regenerate whatever Javadoc they can using Java 7u25. For all practical purses, the vulnerability really only applies to publicly-hosted Javadoc, so the Javadoc in our existing Maven artifacts really doesn't have to be worried about (not that we could do anything about it). My thoughts on this:\n\n1) We should apply the repair-in-place tool ASAP to the Javadoc on the website for Log4j 1 and Log4j 2.\n\n2) Future Log4j 1 and 2 Javadoc should be generated with 7u25 or better. There will be no fix for Java 5 or 6. Thankfully, generating Javadoc using a different JDK than you used to compile is quite easy in both Maven and Ant. In fact, I prefer it that way, because the Javadoc is much more visually attractive in Java 7.\n\n[1] http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html\n[2] http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/225657"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55118, "attachment_id": null, "id": 167911, "time": "2013-06-18T23:44:18Z", "creator": "nicholas@nicholaswilliams.net", "creation_time": "2013-06-18T23:44:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "- that cannot be easily interpreted\n+ that cannot be easily regenerated\n\nNot even sure how that happened..."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55118, "attachment_id": 30469, "id": 167958, "time": "2013-06-21T19:20:49Z", "creator": "olivier.jaquemet@jalios.com", "creation_time": "2013-06-21T19:20:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 30469\nJavaDoc patch (generated with JavaDocFixTool)\n\nPatch generated using official JavaDocFixTool provided by Oracle, against site repository : \n\nhttps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/site/trunk/docs/log4j/1.2\n\nI don't know how to change the build process to ensure the javadoc is generated with the latest version of the JDK."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "Ralph.Goers@dslextreme.com", "text": "I have patched the live web site.
