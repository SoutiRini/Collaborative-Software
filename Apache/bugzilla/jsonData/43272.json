Now I could NOT customize destination of Copy task using extends.\n\nEnhancement: create in Copy task method for overriting \n\nResource getDestResource(File file, String toFile){\n   return new FileResource(destDir, toFile);\n}\n\nCopy.doResourceOperations(){\n  ...\n  ResourceUtils.copyResource(fromResource,getDestResource(destDir, toFile),...\n  ...\n\n2. It is impossible to extends most of Ant classes (exapmle LineTokenizer):\nall class members are PRIVATE. Very bad solution.\n\n3. Most of task have very similar behaviour but every of them written almost by\nthe scratch. Example Copy and Move task. As result I have an Exception in Move\nalso the Copy with the same parameters work OK."}]
