In looking at the implementation it appears that the \n1.1 JSTL XPathUtil class seems to unnecessarily copy every variable from every \ncontext into an internal object to make the variables available to the XPath \nevaluation object. See 'fillVarStack' in 'selectNodes' method. The JSTL 1.0 \nversion of XPathUtil doesn't do this at all - it takes a more reasonable \napproach of simply wrapping the original context objects in an object that \nimplements the appropriate interface (VariableContext). I would suggest taking \na similar approach to avoid the unnecessary overhead and garbage created by \ncopying all of these objects on every executing of 'doStartTag'.", "id": 94693, "time": "2006-10-10T11:41:12Z", "creator": "davew@leadfusion.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-10T11:41:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40717, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 27717 ***", "id": 95502, "time": "2006-11-06T15:36:23Z", "creator": "bayard@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-11-06T15:36:23Z", "is_private": false}]
