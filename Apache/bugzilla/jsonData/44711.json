You have to take care about this by yourself, just the way you are doing now here. Normally you would report any problems with the httpd delivered by RedHat to RedHat.\n"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44711, "text": "Doesn't appear to be an Apache bug, no updates in a year, closing it.", "count": 9, "id": 125916, "time": "2009-03-31T10:22:58Z", "creator": "poirier@pobox.com", "creation_time": "2009-03-31T10:22:58Z", "is_private": false}]
