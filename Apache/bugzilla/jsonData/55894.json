This feature allows multiple sockets listen to the same IP address:port and automatically round robins connections. We created this prototype patch to include this option in the apr_socket_opt_set().\n\nPlease refer to the attached patch file for details. Your feedback is very much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nYingqi Lu", "id": 171782, "time": "2013-12-17T11:04:35Z", "creator": "Yingqi.Lu@intel.com", "creation_time": "2013-12-17T11:04:35Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 31122}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55894, "is_private": false, "id": 171784, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-12-17T11:33:19Z", "time": "2013-12-17T11:33:19Z", "text": "Doesn't seem safe to try sockopt 15 on every platform, it should be explicitly rejected elsewhere even if you're trying to avoid the build-time autoconf test.\n\nI'm also not sure how useful it is in APR if it's only implemented on one platform"}]
