Also filed under mod_jk as Bug #36121*\n\nHi,\n\nOne of our customers uses SSI (mod_include) to include their jsp's\n\neg file index.shtml (located in /web/customer/www)\n<!--#include virtual=\"top.html\"-->\n<!--#include virtual=\"active/news.jsp?${QUERY_STRING}\"-->\n<!--#include virtual=\"bottom.html\"-->\n\nWhat happens is that \"top\" and \"news\" are displayed correctly, but bottom fails\nwith \"[an error occurred while processing this directive]\". If we move the\ninclude of \"bottom.html\" above the jsp line it works (besides from the webpage\nnot displaying as desired :)\n\nThe errorlog contains the following lines after requesting the page from apache;\nFile does not exist: /web/customer/www/active/bottom.html\nunable to include \"bottom.html\" in parsed file /web/customer/www/index.shtml\n\nIf found Bug #34232 mentioning the same, but it was discarded as being apache\nand/or mod_include. I didn't find any references to a new(er) ticket in ASF. The\ncurrent workaround for our customer would be to update their files to 'include\nvirtual=\"../bottom.html\"' or revert back to their original \"exec cgi\" statements\n(which worked, but we agreed with them upon that being deprecated).\n\nFor some reason the \"include virtual\" (or include file which causes the same)\nthat executes the 'jsp' sets the current working directory to \"active\" instead\nof going 'back' to the directory where index.shtml was parsed from.\n\nAny suggestions or options are welcome,\n\nTom"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36191, "text": "You could resolve this.
