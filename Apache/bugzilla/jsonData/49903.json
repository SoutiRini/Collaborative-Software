The same functionality needed for workers file.\n\nBesides obvious use to add or remove workers as needed, there is other reasons to implement it. For example timeouts or activation can be either set at\nstartup time or modified through jkstatus interface. However, when modified\nthrough the jkstatus, the same settings must be duplicated into workers file - this is tedious and error-prone.\n\nAlso property like JkWorkersFileReload needs to be added.\n\nI`ve created patch file partially implements such functionality,\nwith the following restrictions\n - Only Apache2 connector (tried on 2.2.16)\n - Requires JkShmSize directive to be used (to allocate enough space in shared memory for future workers)\n - Only works during maintain phase, so JkWatchdogInterval must be set", "id": 139779, "time": "2010-09-09T02:20:20Z", "bug_id": 49903, "creation_time": "2010-09-09T02:20:20Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 26007}]
