Our requirement is to read CSV files from a remote AIX server over SFTP and embed them into Excel sheet once read. Our program is failing after reading contents over n/w using SFTP and embedding them in to Excel objects. To overcome this, we wrote a separate program just to read the files from remote server and saved them locally. Then wrote another program to read contents from the saved files to Excel and it worked fine. Finally, we combined both programs and it started failing again. It basically gives : \"Segmentation Fault (core dumped)\" error in solaris (ver 10 on SPARC) when trying to create in memory Excel workbook object. Please find attached the java souce program for your reference.\n\nThe java program when run thru command line gives this error.
