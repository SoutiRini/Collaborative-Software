This behaviour does not match the indentation of the code and seems to be unintended.  So one of the following actions should be taken:\n\n1) either modify the given code to read as follows:\n\n\n    if (rv != B_OK) {\n        if (rv == B_TIMED_OUT)\n            return APR_TIMEUP;\n        return rv;\n    }\n\nI believe that this is the correct fix.\n\n2) or change the indentation to reflect the real behaviour and remove the, then useless, code after the \"return rv;\".\n\nI hope this helps,\nJochen\n\nPS.: the email address used for this account is a one-time address and is not monitored by me.", "id": 120578, "time": "2008-09-13T09:59:54Z", "creator": "jochen@thisisnotmyrealemail.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-13T09:59:54Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This would be an APR issue, not httpd.
