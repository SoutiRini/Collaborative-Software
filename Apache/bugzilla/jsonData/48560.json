It has never been designed to be subclassed, but people did so anyway (e.g. Cactus) and in fact this further constrained the changes that could be made.\n\nAs for JUnit4, we've been discussing (with the JUnit people, actually) to create a new junit4 task for years now, but in the end the existing task seems to work well enough for most people so the re-write never took off.\n\nIf we changed setOutfile the <formatter> element suddenly gains a new attribute, something I wouldn't want to do before 1.8.0 is final (too late in the release cycle for anything but bug fixes).", "id": 133670, "time": "2010-01-17T21:25:45Z", "bug_id": 48560, "creation_time": "2010-01-17T21:25:45Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
