If the guess or fallback is incorrect, it could make validation results entirely incoherent. It is highly recommended to check these potential issues, and, if necessary, fix them and re-validate the document.\n Unable to Determine Parse Mode!\n\nThe validator can process documents either as XML (for document types such as XHTML, SVG, etc.) or SGML (for HTML 4.01 and prior versions). For this document, the information available was not sufficient to determine the parsing mode unambiguously, because:\n\nthe MIME Media Type (text/html) can be used for XML or SGML document types\nNo known Document Type could be detected\nNo XML declaration (e.g <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>) could be found at the beginning of the document.\nNo XML namespace (e.g <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\">) could be found at the root of the document.\nAs a default, the validator is falling back to SGML mode.\n\n No DOCTYPE found! Checking with default HTML 4.01 Transitional Document Type.\n\nNo DOCTYPE Declaration could be found or recognized in this document. This generally means that the document is not declaring its Document Type at the top. It can also mean that the DOCTYPE declaration contains a spelling error, or that it is not using the correct syntax.\n\nThe document was checked using a default \"fallback\" Document Type Definition that closely resembles \u201cHTML 4.01 Transitional\u201d.\n\nLearn how to add a doctype to your document from our FAQ.", "count": 3, "id": 165269, "time": "2013-02-15T14:23:07Z", "creator": "stephen.owens@state.ma.us", "creation_time": "2013-02-15T14:23:07Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54565, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I'm using the same Google Chrome version and there are no problems with that page.", "id": 165270, "time": "2013-02-15T14:32:47Z", "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-02-15T14:32:47Z", "is_private": false}]
