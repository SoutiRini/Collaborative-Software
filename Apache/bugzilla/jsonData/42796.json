We had \nmajor performance degradation in doing so. Upon investigation we found that \nlog4j logging is taking almost thrice the time it used to take in WAS 5028.\n\nIt would be great if someone can throw some light on the above mentioned issue.\n\nThe version of log4j we are using is 1.2.8 (we are using the same set of jars \nand same version of log4j in both servers.)"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42796, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 107121, "time": "2007-08-22T20:17:13Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-08-22T20:17:13Z", "text": "This is a request for advice or assistance that should be posted to log4j-user, not a bug for the developers \nto fix."}]
