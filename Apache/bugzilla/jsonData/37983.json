But in this case, the `DAV:`\nheader is added to all PHP scripts\n\nThis is a related problem - http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.user/45401\n\nI think the `Header` directive should affect all resources in a directory,\nincluding those handled by mod_actions\n\nMany thanks!\n\nJack", "id": 83872, "time": "2005-12-21T03:40:39Z", "creator": "ms419@freezone.co.uk", "creation_time": "2005-12-21T03:40:39Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37983, "attachment_id": null, "text": "When you use CGI, it's up to the script to generate custom headers like DAV:.\n\nHowever, I *think* this will work as you want if you use the \"always\" argument\nto Header.
