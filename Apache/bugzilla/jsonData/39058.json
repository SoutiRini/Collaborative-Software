I've noticed what I \nthink may be a logic error in the print method of PrintTranscoder - of course, \nit may also be the intended behaviour.  However, if so, I found it somewhat \nunexpected.\n\nI'm using the PrintTranscoder to print an SVG document.  I set the \nPrintTranscoder.KEY_SHOW_PRINTER_DIALOG transcoding hint to get the printer \ndialog.  This shows the native printer dialog for my system, and from there I \ncan get to the page preferences.  If I toggle the orientation to landscape, \nthis change does not get applied because it get's overridden by the value from \nthe PageFormat specified with the printable after the PrinterDialog is closed.\n\nIf changed from: \n\t        //\n\t        // If required, pop up a dialog to select the printer\n\t        //\n\t        Boolean showPrinterDialog = (Boolean)hints.get\n(KEY_SHOW_PRINTER_DIALOG);\n\t        if(showPrinterDialog != null && showPrinterDialog.booleanValue\n()){\n\t            if(!printerJob.printDialog()){\n\t                // Dialog was cancelled, meaning that the print process\n\t                // should be stopped.\n\t                return;\n\t            }\n\t        }\n\n\t        // Print now\n\t        printerJob.setPrintable(this, pageFormat);\n\t        printerJob.print();\n\nto: \n\t        // Print now\n\t        printerJob.setPrintable(this, pageFormat);\n\n\t        //\n\t        // If required, pop up a dialog to select the printer\n\t        //\n\t        Boolean showPrinterDialog = (Boolean)hints.get\n(KEY_SHOW_PRINTER_DIALOG);\n\t        if(showPrinterDialog != null && showPrinterDialog.booleanValue\n()){\n\t            if(!printerJob.printDialog()){\n\t                // Dialog was cancelled, meaning that the print process\n\t                // should be stopped.\n\t                return;\n\t            }\n\t        }\n\n\t        printerJob.print();\n\nchanges made to the PageFormat from the PrintDialog are applied, which is what \nI would expect to happen.
