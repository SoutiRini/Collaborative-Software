In my env\nthis is reproducable right after the installation with\nthe steps described above. It seems to me that a  resource\nremains on some free list even after it was allocated, so\nis is reallocated to another party again.          incze"}, {"count": 1, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 723 ***", "bug_id": 990, "is_private": false, "id": 1367, "time": "2001-03-19T05:49:06Z", "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-19T05:49:06Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
