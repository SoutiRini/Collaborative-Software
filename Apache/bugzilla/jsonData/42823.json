This \ncan be customized by providing an implementation of TriggeringEventEvaluator and specifying \nevaluatorClass in the configuration file, but that requires you to provide a user-written class.\n\nThis issue was discussed on log4j-user on 2007-07-04 (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/\nlogging-log4j-user/200707.mbox/%3c405794.99416.qm@web7609.mail.in.yahoo.com%3e) and \npreviously in 17-Jan-2002.  Also bug 32572 proposing allowing Filter's to serve as \nTriggeringEventEvaluators.\n\nPossible resolutions:\n\n1. Add a triggeringLevel attribute, if set this would replace the current TriggeringEventEvaluator.\n2. Add a triggeringFilter nested element that would allow a user specified filter to act as a TEE (per \nsuggestion in 32572) and replace current TEE.  Triggering on an arbitrary level would require use of \no.a.l.varia.LevelRangeFilter.\n3.
