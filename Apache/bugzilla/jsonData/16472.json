I had problems\nwith installation because IIS was holding on to 0.0.0.0 when Apache was trying\nto bind to it.\nI stopped IIS and reinstalled, everything ok.\nSince it is a Windows machine, I let IIS start automatically on boot up and\nApache on Manual.\n\nThe Problem:\nI would like to switch when I need to between IIS and Apache. I would normally\ndo this by stopping one service and starting the other. I know this is odd to\nsome but I am lazy and an elementary developer. I am sure there is a better way.\nAnywho, when I go to the Windows 'Services' window Apache is stopping but gets\n\"frozen\" and then in few seconds, it will completely reboot my computer.\n\nThis is big pain and I am not sure why this happens.", "id": 30137, "time": "2003-01-27T20:12:08Z", "bug_id": 16472, "creation_time": "2003-01-27T20:12:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16472, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n  Much like the BSoD errors, a 3rd party WinSock driver or filter is rebooting\n  your system.
