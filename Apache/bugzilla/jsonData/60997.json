Obvious and easy ones are:\n\n1. deniedStatus and have a default implementation of permitDenied setting this status (Note: if not possible in current valve a EnhancedSemaphoreValve would be good enough)\n2. controlConcurrency should enable to match a requestUri, I guess a includeRequestUris and excludeRequestUris is the way to go\n\nOn probably a bit more difficult side, it would be great to support asynchronism limiting. This one can require to move the valve to a filter to be able to wrap the AsyncContext to have the right hooks but this would make it fully functional.\n\nFinally: this valve provides concurrent limit but is there any plan to have rate limiting (based on a time slot)?", "id": 198314, "time": "2017-04-17T07:16:28Z", "bug_id": 60997, "creation_time": "2017-04-17T07:16:28Z", "is_private": false}]
