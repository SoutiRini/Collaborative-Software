[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23550, "text": "When apache is configured as a reverse proxy with mod_mem_cache enabled, it will\ncache 301 responses from the backend. Whether this behaviour is desireable or\nnot, I really do not know, mod_disk_cache for example will not cache these\nresponses because mod_disk_cache does not cache responses without Content-Length\nheader set.\n\nNow, when we hit the memory-cached object, mod_mem_cache returns the original\n301 response with a replaced HTTP status of 200. This causes clients to not\nfollow the redirect.\n\nI will try to illustrate this:\n\nrequest:\n    GET /foo HTTP/1.1\n    Host: www.foo.tld\n\n1st response, before caching:\n    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n    Location: http://www.foo.tld/foo/\n\nsubsequent response, on same request:\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Location: http://www.foo.tld/foo/\n\n=> Client ignores Location: header", "id": 44963, "time": "2003-10-01T17:50:13Z", "creator": "lengerkeh@sixt.de", "creation_time": "2003-10-01T17:50:13Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23550, "is_private": false, "text": "Just confirmed that this bug still exists in 2.0.48", "id": 54368, "time": "2004-03-22T09:12:05Z", "creator": "lengerkeh@sixt.de", "creation_time": "2004-03-22T09:12:05Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "lengerkeh@sixt.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 54369, "time": "2004-03-22T09:14:59Z", "bug_id": 23550, "creation_time": "2004-03-22T09:14:59Z", "text": "Just confirmed that this bug still exists in 2.0.49"}, {"count": 3, "text": "By the looks, this bug is no longer present in 2.0.51", "bug_id": 23550, "is_private": false, "id": 63864, "time": "2004-09-20T11:12:40Z", "creator": "lengerkeh@sixt.de", "creation_time": "2004-09-20T11:12:40Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
