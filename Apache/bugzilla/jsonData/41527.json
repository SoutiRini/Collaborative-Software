But when we enable php by placing the appropiate LoadModule directive, \nthen all requests that should be forwarded to Tomcat causes a Segmentation \nfault that can be seen at the error log file. I've tried to use both PHP 5.2.0 \nand 4.4.4 with the same results. I finally compiled mod_jk as a dynamic module \nand this time everything works ok (both PHP and mod_jk), so I think there's \nsome kind of bug when mod_jk is linked statically to the apache.\n\nThank you!", "id": 98903, "time": "2007-02-02T05:52:08Z", "bug_id": 41527, "creation_time": "2007-02-02T05:52:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 98905, "time": "2007-02-02T06:11:37Z", "bug_id": 41527, "creation_time": "2007-02-02T06:11:37Z", "is_private": false, "text": "What do you suppose we should do with this?\nYour bz report is missing some crucial facts like OS, mod_jk version,\ncore dump, error messages, etc.\n\nPlease provide additional data and the how-to-replicate-the-bug steps,\nand reopen the case.\n\nRegards."}]
