The second time, the init() method does not\nget called, and so \"reinit()\" gets called. This attempts to\nset the properties again. This behaviour was probally needed\nin per ant 1.6 or even pre ant 1.5 code. In any case it does not\nwork now and it is not needed. reinit should simply call init().\n\nI have just made the change in CVS (but forgot to associate the\nchange with this bug report)"}]
