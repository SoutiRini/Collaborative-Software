But I am having this problem as well (the same stacktrace).  I cannot increase the heap size, as I am attempting to export an Excel file from an Android device.  I had hoped to switch from JXL to POI because it seems that POI is better maintained.  Both libraries had OutOfMemoryErrors when creating a large Excel file.  JXL has an option to not load everything in memory, but to use a temporary file.  Using this option solved this issue using that library.\n\nSo I'm wondering if this could indeed be a bug in POI that could be resolved by using a temporary file instead of memory.\n\nCould you please elaborate with a bit more details, if this is really not a bug?\n\nThanks.", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38632, "text": "Please ask all usage questions on the mailing list - http://poi.apache.org/mailinglists.html - bugzilla is not the place to ask for help", "id": 169556, "time": "2013-08-18T16:28:20Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2013-08-18T16:28:20Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
