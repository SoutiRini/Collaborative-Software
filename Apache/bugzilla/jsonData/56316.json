The filters are appearing on the header rows, but unfortunately I am unable to filter the cell value by clicking on the filters. \n  I know that the excel sheet has an option to enable only the filter option when we try to protect the worksheet. Am looking for a similar functionality in Apache POI.\n  Any help would be really appreciated\n\nThanks,\n   Noel"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56316, "text": "Please attach a manually created excel file with the correct settings.\nIt's not clear, if you want a solution for the binary or xml based format.", "id": 174090, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "kiwiwings@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-03-26T00:17:46Z", "time": "2014-03-26T00:17:46Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 31439\nScreen shot showing the 'Use AutoFilter' feature while protecting sheet", "attachment_id": 31439, "id": 174093, "creator": "noel.toms@gmail.com", "time": "2014-03-26T04:43:27Z", "bug_id": 56316, "creation_time": "2014-03-26T04:43:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56316, "text": "Hi Andreas,\n\n  I have ttached a manually created excel sheet which shows the 'Use AutoFilter' option while i try to protect the sheet.
