If I fire up my browser and go \nto http://localhost:8041/fop/servlet/fop it says I need the 'fo' parameter so \nit must be running the servlet code, but when I add on the ?fo=... it falls \nover with an internal servlet error:\n\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:org/apache/fop/apps/Driver\nat org.apache.fop.tools.servlet.FopServlet.renderFO(FopServlet.java:117)\nat org.apache.fop.tools.servlet.FopServlet.doGet(FopServlet.java:88)\nat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:740) etc...\n\nI've checked my .jar files and all the classes directly referenced by the \nDriver appear to be there.
