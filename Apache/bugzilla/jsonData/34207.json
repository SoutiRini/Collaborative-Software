I have entered http://localhost:8080 and a dialog window appears,\nrequesting the user name and the password.\n\nI have entered the administration user of Tomcat (admin), and my system\nusername, and the administration system username. But, I can't access to the\nmain page of Tomcat.\n\nAfter this, I have stopped every service of my computer (antivirus, Oracle,\nMySQL...) and I have delete every resident program. And the result is the same.\n\nI have verified my proxy. It's OK. I can navigate, reveive and send emails, do\ntelnets, ftps, and so.\n\nI have JOnAS installed previously, attacking 9000 port. But this application\nserver isn't running on my system.\n\nThere is a track: On my MS Internet Explorer v6.0 browser, the dialog window is\ndiferent to my FireFox v1.0.1 browser. The title is \"Connecting to localhost\",\nand the message is \"XDB\". In the bottom appears an image with two keys over blue\nbackground. In the Firefox, the title is \"Request\", no message appears, and a\nnew option check appears, with this message: \"Use the administrator manager for\nremember the password\".\n\nI don't know what is the problem. Please, help me.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\nYrgola", "id": 72926, "time": "2005-03-28T15:58:53Z", "creator": "yrgola@yahoo.es", "creation_time": "2005-03-28T15:58:53Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34207, "attachment_id": null, "id": 72927, "time": "2005-03-28T16:01:08Z", "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-28T16:01:08Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please use the tomcat-user list to debug.\n\nBugzilla is a not a help desk."}]
