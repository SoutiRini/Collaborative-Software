Basically we log a bunch of messages for each http request. Then, we found that http response time gets hits. So what we ended up was to first log each message to a StringBuffer, after some messages are logged, i.e. 100, we then call log4j api to log. This has improved the response time. However, we still see a response hit when the chunk of messages\nare written to file.\n\nLily\nhttp://www.alldiscountbooks.net", "id": 146133, "time": "2011-05-05T05:52:13Z", "bug_id": 50844, "creation_time": "2011-05-05T05:52:13Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
