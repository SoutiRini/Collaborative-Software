However, the file\n(%F) and line number (%L) point to the location in my wrapping class, rather\nthan the client code that called on the wrapper.\n\nThis is because the non-localized methods in Catergory accept a FQCN argument\nused in obtaining the file/line number.\n\nThe localized methods (l7dlog) in Category do not accept a FQCN agrument, so\nthey report the wrong information.\n\nSee my JDC posting here:\nhttp://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=693934&tstart=0", "id": 83916, "time": "2005-12-22T13:22:22Z", "bug_id": 38008, "creation_time": "2005-12-22T13:22:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38008, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\nThis was a duplicate of another bug...\n\nThe FQCN argument was added for 1.3 (SVN trunk)", "id": 98641, "time": "2007-01-28T03:49:12Z", "creator": "genman@noderunner.net", "creation_time": "2007-01-28T03:49:12Z", "is_private": false}]
