I.e. I set the name of the \"Test plan\" node. Then I save my test plan,\nand exit Jmeter.\n\nThen I start Jmeter, and I open my saved test plan. If I now try to close the\ntest  plan, Jmeter tells me that something has changed, and that I asks me if I\nwant to save my changes.\n\nI'll attach to test plans, both just containin the test plan element itself.\nThe first test plan has the default name \"Test Plan\". That test plan I can open\nand close as many times I want in a Jmeter session without problems.\nThe second test plan hat the name \"Another Name\". That test plan I can open, but\nwhenever I try to close it, Jmeter thinks I have changed it.\n\nI've looked a bit at the code, and the problem seems to be in the CheckDirty class.\nI've been able to trace the problem to the following line in the CheckDirty\nclass, in the method addNode :\nif (!previousGuiItems.get(treeNode).equals(treeNode.getTestElement())) {\nWhat I observe, is that the treeNode.getName() returns \"Another Name\" and\npreviousGuiItems.get(treeNode)).getName() returns \"Test Plan\".\n\nI do not know where the bug is, but it seems like the name of the item in the\nhash map is not set correctly. I'm a bit unsure when the tree node for the root\nof the testplan is made."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41779, "attachment_id": 19677, "id": 100129, "time": "2007-03-07T05:03:10Z", "creator": "alf@i100.no", "creation_time": "2007-03-07T05:03:10Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 19677\nTest plan with default name for the test plan node\n\nThis test plan you should be able to open and close as many times as you want"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41779, "attachment_id": 19678, "id": 100130, "time": "2007-03-07T05:05:00Z", "creator": "alf@i100.no", "creation_time": "2007-03-07T05:05:00Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 19678\nTest plan with another name set for the test plan node\n\nWhen you open this test plan, and then try to close it, or to open another test\nplan, or try to exit Jmeter, you will get the dialog box stating that the test\nplan has changed, and a question wether you want to save changes."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41779, "attachment_id": null, "id": 100131, "time": "2007-03-07T05:19:49Z", "creator": "alf@i100.no", "creation_time": "2007-03-07T05:19:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Note that this is somewhat related to bug 25441, which I was looking into.\nI'm not sure if it is exactly the same problem, therefore I opened a new bug report."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41779, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This bug should be closed as fixed, since the changes applied in bug 25441\nsolves this problem.", "id": 103023, "time": "2007-05-09T23:28:16Z", "creator": "alf@i100.no", "creation_time": "2007-05-09T23:28:16Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41779, "attachment_id": null, "id": 104008, "time": "2007-06-03T03:59:07Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-06-03T03:59:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Agreed"}]
