[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "While doing an audit of Sun one application server I noticed they provided a few\nexample web applications which actually where written by apache. I found that\nthe following scripts suffer from cross site scripting attacks. Below is a list\nof the script and attack string.

I did notice one of\nthe scripts listed above \"cal1.jsp\" was recently patched against a few cross\nsite scripting issues at\n\"http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/webapps/examples/jsp/cal/cal1.jsp\"\n\n I agree with the statement \"Obviously, the examples webapp should be removed\nbefore putting Tomcat in production anyway.\", but sometimes people don't use\ncommon sense, and for this reason I have filled out this bug report. I am\nnot aware of which versions of tomcat come included with these issues since I\nhave not done any type of tomcat audit.
