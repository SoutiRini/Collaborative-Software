In this case, you will want to check each of the below sections to see what might be preventing your CGI program from emitting the proper HTTP headers.\n\nThis message can also be caused by invalid CGI script format.  In particular, for a Linux-hosted server, the first line of the script must end with line feed and not carriage return and line feed; the exec library function treats the carriage return as a part of the command string, causing the invocation to fail with \"command not found\" or \"script not found\".  This can happen if you created your script in Notepad and uploaded it using WebFolders in Microsoft Windows (the file gets uploaded as-is, with the original file separators)."}, {"count": 1, "text": "This is no bug of httpd.", "bug_id": 47259, "is_private": false, "id": 127354, "time": "2009-05-24T23:56:56Z", "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-05-24T23:56:56Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 47259, "is_private": false, "id": 127355, "time": "2009-05-25T00:00:47Z", "creator": "ne01026@shark.2a.pl", "creation_time": "2009-05-25T00:00:47Z", "tags": [], "text": "This is a proposed enhancement to the documentation of httpd, as specified in the bug headers.
