Here's \nmy tag file (simplified for debugging):\n\n<%@ attribute name=\"books\" required=\"true\" rtexprvalue=\"true\" \ntype=\"java.util.Collection\" %>\n<%@ attribute name=\"color\" required=\"true\" %>\n\n${color}\n${books.numberOfBooks}\n\nI'm passing a collection for the books attribute. However, I'm getting \nJSP exception (and not a very helpful one at that) when the tag is \nexecuted because the tag handler generated from the tag file is \nincorrect- the type of the books attribute is set to String instead of \nCollection. Is this a bug that has been fixed that I haven't picked up \nor is it a new one?", "id": 23388, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "jan.luehe@sun.com", "creation_time": "2002-09-25T19:04:28Z", "time": "2002-09-25T19:04:28Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jan.luehe@sun.com", "text": "Fixed.\n", "id": 23394, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 13000, "creation_time": "2002-09-25T20:51:17Z", "time": "2002-09-25T20:51:17Z", "is_private": false}]
