It suggests to me that\ninheritance is not operating properly for list-blocks, at least for spacing and\npossibly in general.\n\nThe scenario I am seeing is as follows:\n\nGiven\n\n<fo:list-item-body start-indent=\"body-start()\">\n<fo:block>\n...\n</fo:block>\n</fo:list-item-body>\n\nThe fo:block will indent as expected -- that is, it will appear at the\nindentation position that is expected of the list-item-body.\n\nIf, however, a start-indent is specified for the fo:block:\n\n<fo:list-item-body start-indent=\"body-start()\">\n<fo:block start-indent=\"0.25in\">\n...\n</fo:block>\n</fo:list-item-body>\n\nthen the fo-block is indented **relative to the indentation of the containing\n<fo:list-block>\n\nI have not tried it, but it would be interesting to see what the effect would be\nof specifying <fo:block indent=\"0\">.\n\nI haven't looked at the code, but my suspicion is that either (a) the\nstart-indent inheritance processing within FOP has a bug of some sort, or (b)\nthe XSL-FO specification got the inheritance specification wrong.
