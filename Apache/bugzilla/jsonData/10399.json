The ant/xml \napproach is a declarative approach, therefore <condition> fits better.\n- I would not invent a separate task just to factor out timout issues from\n  the condition task. \n- The waitfor task seems to subsum the condition task. Anything that I could do\n  with the condition task, i could also do with the waitfor task but not the \nother way round.
