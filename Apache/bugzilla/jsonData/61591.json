PR on GitHub is perfect place for discussion, as it is contextual with the code. Also, discussion happens _before_ code merged, so it eliminates the post-commit investigations on dev mailing list.\n\nRequirement to interact with Bugzilla reveals ugly nineties-style issue tracker, it serves bad reputation for us.
