It tries to make the junit test case fail in case of an exception. Junit will not see those failures, since they are in different threads.\n\nAttached patch will channel the exception to main junit thread, which can call fail() if exceptions were catched. It will log only the first exception in the queue.", "attachment_id": 25328, "id": 136293, "creator": "felix.schumacher@internetallee.de", "time": "2010-04-21T14:08:24Z", "bug_id": 49164, "creation_time": "2010-04-21T14:08:24Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49164, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Many thanks for the patch.\n\nIt has been applied to 7.0.x and will be included in 7.0.0 onwards.", "id": 136350, "time": "2010-04-23T09:48:41Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-04-23T09:48:41Z", "is_private": false}]
