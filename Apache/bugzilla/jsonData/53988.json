If the user accidentally or intentionally deletes FCGIWrapper file, this would prevent Apache from starting up.\n\nMissing FCGIWrapper should not be a critical error. Instead it should be logged as an error during Apache startup\n\nOne potential fix could be use yet another flag in FcgidWrapper Directive and if this flag exists, don't check for the existence of FcgidWrapper\n\nAnother, much simpler one would be to use \n\nap_log_perror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_STARTUP|APLOG_ERR, apr_get_os_error(), cmd->pool, \"mod_fcgid: Wrapper does not exist at %s\", path);\n\ninstead of\n\nreturn missing_file_msg(cmd->pool, \"Wrapper\", path, rv);"}]
