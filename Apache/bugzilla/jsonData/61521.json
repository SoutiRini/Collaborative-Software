The while consists of an if block, a timer and a disabled dummy sampler.\nWhen the dummysampler is ENABLED there is no exception.\nWhen the dummysampler is DISABLED and the if block is not executed, an exception occurs.\nWhen the dummysampler is disabled but the if blocks child sampler is executed no exception is raised.\nSo it seems that the while controller has an issue when no active sampler is executed.\nThe use case is that the if block is executed at an interval. A workaround is adding a dummy sampler in the while block, but that is sub optimal.\n\nSee attached jmeter.log and example project.", "id": 200880, "time": "2017-09-15T09:35:45Z", "creator": "ikkedus@xs4all.nl", "creation_time": "2017-09-15T09:35:45Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 35712\nTest plan without plugins", "attachment_id": 35712, "bug_id": 61521, "id": 203594, "time": "2018-01-31T17:22:00Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2018-01-31T17:22:00Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 203595, "time": "2018-01-31T17:22:20Z", "bug_id": 61521, "creation_time": "2018-01-31T17:22:20Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Issue affects also 3.3 and 4.0"}]
