I somehow copied a server.xml configuration file without read permission for others (eg chmod o-r). Note that it was readable for the tomcat user and the tomcat group. The server started OK but every file the webapp would be creating on the filesystem would have by default rw----- mode (eg, no read for group or others). This further went on to break my system.\n\n*Only* changing the permissions of the server.xml file made Tomcat back to its normal behavior. I had a look at the Gentoo init scripts and I really don't think they are the cause of the problem, they dont do anything strange relative to umask or whatever."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48690, "text": "I can't repeat this with a standard Tomcat distro from the ASF on linux.
