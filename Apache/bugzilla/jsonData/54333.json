These are really useful to manipulate the run and go beyond the standard behavior, and I would like that to include the control on whether sample should be recorded or not. Right now, TestAction is the only one that doesn't appear in the results, this is because, it's sample() method unconditionally returns null for result. If I can manipulate the result the way I was suggesting before, or even mark it as to be discarded (e.g., by calling SampleResult.setDiscard(true)), it will provide an option to control their appearance in the final results.\n\n> \n> > BTW, in the documentation at\n> > http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#executionorder it\n> > indicates that the listeners are skipped if SampleResult is null, but I\n> > don't see the check in the code.\n> \n> Can you point to the exact phrase that says that ?\n\nI was referring to this: \"unless SampleResult is null\"\n\nHowever, I found the code in JMeterThread that checks the result for null and skip the documented steps, so there is nothing wrong here.", "id": 164350, "time": "2013-01-03T13:24:48Z", "creator": "haridara@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-01-03T13:24:48Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 54846 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "is_private": false, "id": 166615, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2013-04-14T21:46:22Z", "bug_id": 54333, "creation_time": "2013-04-14T21:46:22Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "text": "Notes from duplocate bug\n\nSometimes it is desirable to ignore particular samples where you do some setup that is not interesting to be recorded. For example login and similar. Changing layout of test plan often does not look nice.\n\nI think org.apache.jmeter.samplers.SampleResult can be extended to have a property ignore or ignoreByListeners. For scripting samplers one can set that property. And for other samplers the transaction controller can be extended to support marking it's parent sample to be ignored so one can put any samples to be ignored under a transaction controller.\n\nRegards", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 166616, "time": "2013-04-14T21:47:04Z", "bug_id": 54333, "creation_time": "2013-04-14T21:47:04Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54333, "text": "Note that a SetUp group should normally be used for this purpose, in which case the samples will not be saved by Listeners in t5he main thread group.\n\nAlso only Samplers generate samples, so it is possible to use (e.g.) a BeanShell PreProcessor to do the setup.", "id": 166655, "time": "2013-04-16T15:46:04Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-04-16T15:46:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
