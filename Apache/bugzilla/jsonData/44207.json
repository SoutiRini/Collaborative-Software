The log level of all messages is \"info\".\n\nThe messages tell us, that when writing back to the client (=browser), mod_jk\ndetected that it actually couldn't write back. Usually this simply means, that\nthe browser didn't wait long enough for the response, but the user instead\nstarted another response (clicked another link, or the same link a second time\netc.).\n\nIf this happens a lot, it mostly is an indication, that your application\nperformance is not good, so users get nervous and try something else.\n\nTo get an idea about your appps response times, add \"%D\" to your httpd LogFormat\n(microseconds response duration) and maybe also add an access log valve to\nTomcat with a pattern, that includes also \"%D\" (milliseconds for tomcat).\n\nIf you have further questions, please ask the users list."}]
