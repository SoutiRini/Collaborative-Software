To do that,\nI need to pass environment along.  The documentation for mod_ext_filter states\nthat the standard CGI variables plus a few extras are sent.  This is not the\ncase.  NOTHING is sent.  See this code snippet from line 407:\n\n    rc = apr_proc_create(ctx->proc,\n                            ctx->filter->command, \n                            (const char * const *)ctx->filter->args, \n                            NULL, /* environment */\n                            ctx->procattr,\n                            ctx->p);\n\nAs you can see, the environment is not being passed at all.  Hopefully this will\nbe a trivial fix, as this feature is vital for my purposes."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 10925 ***", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 11353, "id": 20549, "time": "2002-08-01T17:08:18Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-08-01T17:08:18Z", "attachment_id": null}]
