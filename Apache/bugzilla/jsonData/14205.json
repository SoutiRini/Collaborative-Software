The priority should be first mentioned, first served. Opera \ndoes not assign a q-value to each language, so they will have equal values, but it is wrong to treat \nthem as equally good and pick any of them. This will give different languages from different \ndirectories depending on how the files are found.\nThis worked very well in 1.3.x for files like \nindex.var mentioning index.da.html and index.en.html. Now its totally broken. Even explicitly \ncalling index.var will not give the wanted primary language.\n\n# DefaultLanguage \nda\nAddLanguage da .da\nAddLanguage en .en\nForceLanguagePriority and \nLanguagePriority have no consistent influence."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "slive@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 25586, "time": "2002-11-04T01:27:32Z", "bug_id": 14205, "creation_time": "2002-11-04T01:27:32Z", "tags": [], "text": "I'm not sure what \"has no consistent influence\" means.

It is Opera that is broken here.\nThat is not to say that Apache shouldn't use the order when it otherwise\nhas no way to decide.  That is certainly a possibility.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 10114 ***"}]
