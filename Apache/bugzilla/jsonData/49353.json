This patch changes hardwired logfactor directory so that it is created as hidden directory with more verbose name. No policy exists for Windows as far as directory names for configuration are concerned so this should not affect it.\n\nAttached patch changes userdir for logfactor from $HOME/lf5 to $HOME/.logfactor5\nPatch was created against 1.2.16 release of log4j"}]
