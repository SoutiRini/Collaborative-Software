Downloads from IIS are at \n8-9MB/sec regardless of which of these clients is used.  Downloads from Tomcat \n(standalone) are also on the order of 8MB/sec for all these clients.\n\nThe numbers involved suggest a Nagle algorithm issue, but my (naive) scan of \nthe Apache 1.3.26 sources suggest that NODELAY is already being set.
