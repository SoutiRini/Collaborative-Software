[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "k.mueller@wsiwlt.com", "text": "Problems in chronological order:\n\n1) When installing mod_perl with apxs data persistence problem appeared: the \nwrong page is displayed. This symptom was reproduced on two identical Solaris \nconfigurations in two different companies with 2 different applications. Both \napplication are mod_perl compliant. One of them was even double checked.\n\n2) I decided to re-install Apache 2.2.4. The new compilation with gcc 3.4.6 \nfailed on expat symbol error with the configure directive: --enable-mods-\nshared=all. Only static builds could be performed.\n\n3) If apache 2.2.4 was statically linked an expat error was returned as the \nserver is started.\n\nObservation:\n\nThe libexpat.so library was found in the path: \u2026httpd-2.2.4/srclib/apr-\nutil/xml/expat. It was assumed the origin of the problem was this library \ndelivered with the Apache tar ball.\n\nRemedy used:\n\n1) A new expat library was installed from the Solaris Companion CD for Solaris \n9.04. It was version 1.95. The souce was copied into the expat directory \nmentioned above. The results remained the same. These libraries were removed \nfrom the system.\n\n2) The expat library was installed from the latest available source (version \n2.037) with a plain vanilla configure / make / make install. Apache 2.2.4 \ncompiled without problem.  mod_perl installed with apxs. All the above problems \ndisappeared. The compiler library flags were set in order to search first \nthe /user/local/lib first. This is the location the new libexpat.so was \ninstalled.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe delivered libexpat.so does not perform correctly on Solaris 9. I would \nsuggest not to deliver this library but to set it as a prerequisite for the \ninstallation of Apache 2. The test of the version can be done with xmlwf \u2013v in \nthe configure script to secure the appropriate version of the library is linked.\n\nRegards Klaus M\u00fcller\nwww.wsiwlt.com", "id": 107943, "time": "2007-09-10T01:30:42Z", "bug_id": 43336, "creation_time": "2007-09-10T01:30:42Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43336, "is_private": false, "id": 109213, "creation_time": "2007-10-10T15:02:06Z", "time": "2007-10-10T15:02:06Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "text": "It's not clear exactly what specific bug is being reported here.\n\nNo details are provided for problems (1), (2) or (3) sufficient for anybody to\nactually solve them.
