For more details, see The \nUnicode Standard.)\n\t\t\t \nMy comment : Isn't there a typo here ? Shouldn't we rather read 65,534 here ?\n\nAnyway, CmapFormat4 (and maybe other thable formats) should do a basic sanity \ncheck.\n\nPatch coming soon.\n\nCheers,\n\np.b.", "is_private": false, "id": 57130, "creator": "pierrick.brihaye@free.fr", "time": "2004-05-10T19:16:07Z", "bug_id": 28886, "creation_time": "2004-05-10T19:16:07Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": 11504, "tags": [], "creator": "pierrick.brihaye@free.fr", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 57131, "time": "2004-05-10T19:20:12Z", "bug_id": 28886, "creation_time": "2004-05-10T19:20:12Z", "text": "Created attachment 11504\nA very basic patch that, at least, prevents an ArrayOutOfBoundsException"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 61877, "time": "2004-08-12T11:37:34Z", "bug_id": 28886, "creation_time": "2004-08-12T11:37:34Z", "text": "*** Bug 28885 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28886, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This or something like it has been applied.", "id": 62563, "time": "2004-08-27T00:56:04Z", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-08-27T00:56:04Z", "is_private": false}]
