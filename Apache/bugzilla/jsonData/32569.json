[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "We have a web app running under Tomcat 5.0.28. We wrote a ServletContextListener\nand configured it in the web.xml, and all works fine.

Tomcat then\nreloaded the app. Our listener got a contextDestroyed call, as expected, but\nthen it still received a contextInitialized when the app was re-started (we know\nthis because of some logging we do in the listener).
