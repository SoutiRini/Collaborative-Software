TIBCO BusinessEvents looks up the javax.jms.Destination on the connected JMS server using this queue or topic name. If TIBCO BusinessEvents cannot find one, it creates a new javax.jms.Destination using the given queue or topic name. TIBCO BusinessEvents then sets the JMSReplyTo header property of the outgoing JMS message using this destination \n\nCan you try again with nightly build and see it it's working ?\nSee http://jmeter.apache.org/nightly.html\n\nInstalling JMeter runtime\nDownload the _bin and _lib files\nUnpack the archives into the same directory structure\nThe other archives are not needed to run JMeter. \n\nThanks"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56972, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 179135, "time": "2014-11-16T12:59:59Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2014-11-16T12:59:59Z", "text": "Closing as we got no feedback after the fix of 57052 and cannot reproduce after the fix.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 57052 ***"}]
