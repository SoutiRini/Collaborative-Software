However, they are applied to the trunk version, and are not in 0.95 (they will be in the next version).

Plain fact is that the number of classes has increased significantly between the two versions, so that makes the influence of JVM warmup time all the greater. If you run FOP repeatedly from the command-line, you may want to take the time to set up a small wrapper that keeps the app sleeping in the background to avoid the VM startup.\n\nRedo the test by running the same file in a Java program, looped to repeat 11 times. Compare times 2 to 10, and that will give you a more realistic picture of the actual difference."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "sunil.budati@ge.com", "is_private": false, "text": "After I debug the code indetail, I found the place where exactly delay occuring with FOP 0.95.
