This can be a major problem if you want to run Ant on one\nJDK (e.g. 1.4.2) while generating Javadoc for a project using another JDK (e.g.\n1.5.0 beta). For example, there is no way to make 1.4.2's javadoc tool handle\n1.5 generic sources. (-bootclasspath is no help: this does not change where the\nclasses for the tool itself are loaded from.) Without this patch, it is thus\nimpossible to make <javadoc> generate Javadoc for 1.5 generic sources when\nrunning Ant itself on a 1.4 or earlier VM. You need to use <exec> or <apply> or\nsimilar, which of course loses all the readability and error-checking of the\nnormal task.\n\nProvides some parity with the 'executable' attribute of <javac>.\n\nPatch was lightly tested on Linux using 1.4.2 vs. 1.5.0 b62; seems to work as\ndesired.\n\nNote that whatever bits of logic disable certain flags that are not supported by\nthe \"current\" Javadoc version, will not be accurate if using an explicit\nexecutable. I think in practice this would not be a problem; the user would need\nto not attempt to set optional attributes (or nested elements) on <javadoc> that\nmight not work in the target Javadoc version.\n\nImpact on NetBeans IDE 4.0:\n\nhttp://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=46901", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 12397\nSuggested patch", "attachment_id": 12397, "bug_id": 30606, "id": 61854, "time": "2004-08-11T22:40:51Z", "creator": "jglick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-08-11T22:40:51Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 22244 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 30606, "id": 72504, "time": "2005-03-16T16:55:43Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-16T16:55:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30606, "attachment_id": null, "id": 72990, "time": "2005-03-29T16:57:37Z", "creator": "jglick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-29T16:57:37Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Working on a patch for this for 1.7.
