[{"text": "Hello,\n\nI use Apache 2.2.22 on my Debian Wheezy (7 / stable) box.\nI run into troubles using mpm-itk and mod_fcgid (for PHP) together.\n\nAs soon as I add the ITK directive \"AssignUserID\" to my vhost,\nspecifying a different user than the global Apache one,\nmod_fcgid fails returning the following error :\n\n[Sun Jul 28 15:09:37 2013] [emerg] [client x.x.x.x]\n(13)Permission denied: mod_fcgid: can't lock process table in pid 1973\n\nThis bug does not seem to be related to socket permissions,\nas patching mod_fcgid to enlarge them does not help.\n\nPerhaps mpm-itk tries to run mod_fcgid with the global Apache user\ninstead of the specified \"AssignUserID\" user...\nOr perhaps mod_fcgid does not take the \"AssignUserID\" user from mpm-itk...\n\nSteinar, the author of mpm-itk, has also been notified.\nhttp://mpm-itk.sesse.net\n\nThank you very much for your support !\n\nBest regards,\n\nBen", "tags": [], "creator": "ben.rubson@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 169075, "time": "2013-08-03T17:43:33Z", "bug_id": 55350, "creation_time": "2013-08-03T17:43:33Z", "attachment_id": null}]
