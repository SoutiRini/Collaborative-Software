At some point of time, the ssh connection is cut because the remote server is inside a DMZ and the firewall times out the ssh connection.\n\nI am posting a patch to permit the setting of ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax parameters supported by JSCH library.\n\nThe default values I put in the patch are the one from Linux OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 client (interval of 0 => disabled, and count max of 3)\n\n\nCan you take a look and include it in the next release ?\n\nBTW, when is the next release scheduled for ?\n\nThank you very much", "id": 189344, "time": "2016-03-10T15:46:19Z", "creator": "flop.m@usa.net", "creation_time": "2016-03-10T15:46:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 33656}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "flop.m@usa.net", "is_private": false, "id": 189776, "time": "2016-03-29T10:20:55Z", "bug_id": 59162, "creation_time": "2016-03-29T10:20:55Z", "tags": [], "text": "Any comment on this ?
