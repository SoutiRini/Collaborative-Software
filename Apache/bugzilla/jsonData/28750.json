[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28750, "text": "Currently I have an application. The main directory under the webapps/myapp all \nthose files I don't need protected. I need certain pages (admin stuff) \nprotected. So I put that into a /webapps/myapp/admin directory with basic \nauthentication. \n\nMy problem comes with forms. If I create a form in the webapps/myapp directory \nand hit submit, it takes user to a confirmation page of what they entered. They \nhit the back button and the form will still contain the data they just entered. \nhowever, if I create a form in webapps/myapp/admin directory, when user hits \nback button,none of the data is saved. I have tried this with very basic form \nas below. test2.jsp just says \"TESTING\". \n\n\n<form method=post action=test2.jsp>\n<input type=text>\n<input type=submit value=Go>\n</form>\n\nI thought that form saving data was automatic. The only difference is which \ndirectory I put the form in. It seems that it's not reading something properly. \nThe only difference is that the admin dir I have it set so only certain users \ncan enter but other than that nothing. \n\nI tried this in another created directory without any authentication and it \nworked (saved data after hitting back button). I am using Tomcat 5.0\n\nPLEASE HELP!", "count": 0, "id": 56768, "time": "2004-05-03T20:09:55Z", "creator": "tracy.pleasant@lmco.com", "creation_time": "2004-05-03T20:09:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "text": "Tomcat adds response headers to protected pages to prevent them from being \ncached by proxy servers.
