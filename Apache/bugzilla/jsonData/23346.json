[{"count": 0, "text": "Hi,\nI've found that apache will ignore .htaccess files (or the equivalent \n<directory> directives) if the directory is by passed by a symbolic link.\n\nFor example, if I have a virtual host at \n   /www/bentest.co.uk, \na .htacces file for password authentication at \n   /www/bentest.co.uk/test/.htaccess \nand another directory at \n   /www/bentest.co.uk/test/info\n\nthen symbolically link that directory 'info' to /www/bentest.co.uk/mylink, the .\nhtaccess file in the middle directory ('test') has been bypassed.  \n\nThis seems to be the case for all <directory> directives.  Version 1.3.x manages \nit ok which is why I think it's a bug rather than designed that way.\n\nThanks,\n\nBen\nSigmer Technologies Ltd", "bug_id": 23346, "attachment_id": null, "id": 44492, "time": "2003-09-23T09:08:03Z", "creator": "ben@sigmer.com", "creation_time": "2003-09-23T09:08:03Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "text": "There has been no change since 1.3 and this is not a bug.
