Sometimes\nwhen I log out, Tomcat will still run, but portions of the site becomes buggy. \nWe create images on the fly and they fail to load properly.  The problem has\nsomething to do with the jars initially loaded not working anymore.  Sometimes\nTomcat, however, crashes completely.  Not sure exactly what is going on.\n"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "I don't see any Tomcat issues here.", "is_private": false, "id": 103528, "creation_time": "2007-05-22T17:12:05Z", "time": "2007-05-22T17:12:05Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "bug_id": 42490, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "rm@moosauer.de", "attachment_id": null, "id": 104062, "time": "2007-06-05T02:18:58Z", "bug_id": 42490, "creation_time": "2007-06-05T02:18:58Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\nYou have to unset your DISPLAY -var before starting tomcat remotely!\nOtherwise the awt-toolkit will try to use your your remote x-server.\n\n"}]
