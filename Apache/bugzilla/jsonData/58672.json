I think this may be an incomplete list of rules, for example, a single apostrophe (if this is allowed, I'm guessing some of our CellAddress-related scripts fail when parsing a \"'Some Chick'n'!A1\". This should be added as a unit test, with expected pass or fail depending on Excel and OpenOffice/LibreOffice behavior).\n\nThe Excel error dialog:\n\"\"\"You typed in an invalid name for a sheet or chart. Make sure that:\n\nThe name that you type does not exceed 31 characters.\nThe name does not contain any of the following characters: : \\ / ? *\n[ or ]\n\nYou did not leave the name blank.\"\"\"\n\nThis forum also mentions the sheet name \"History\" is off-limits. I wonder if formula names are valid--maybe a formula and a new (sheet name or named range) can be differentiated by the presence of an open parenthesis.\n\n[1] https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/5627d4c3-6023-4ca7-b3d4-f93419e3b560/what-are-the-rules-for-the-name-of-an-excel-worksheet?forum=excel", "is_private": false, "id": 186682, "creator": "onealj@apache.org", "time": "2015-11-30T17:56:27Z", "bug_id": 58672, "creation_time": "2015-11-30T17:56:27Z", "attachment_id": null}]
