I am running multiple websites on \none machine using virtual hosts. \n\nLinux Distro: RedHat Linux (full updates). \nCMS Package: Postnuke (PHP Code)\n\nThe problem is that when I install Postnuke without any virtual hosts, All the \nvariables work perfectly. Since I am running multiple sites, all with different \ndomains, I am using virtual hosting. Using virtual hosting, it seems that some \nof the variables like HTTP_USER_AGENT will not be seen by the exact same \nPostnuke code that worked without virtual hosts. Apache see's the information \ncorrectly. PHP sees the info correctly (with a simple phpinfo() ). \n\nThis bug is not limited to just Postnuke. Alternate Web based counters which \nrecord the same information also fail (they cannot retrieve that information).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15156, "text": "I find it hard to imagine that this could be an Apache httpd problem.\nHave you tried with an ordinary CGI script?
