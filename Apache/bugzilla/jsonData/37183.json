This way it should be much more reliable to obtain \nvalues of select/option etc than making complex regex.\n  This function is complement to existing XPath function - that is capable to \nquery files only.\n\nTypical usage:\n${__XPathResponse(/html/head/title,myTitle)}\n     - extracts Title from HTML response and put it to myTitle variable \n${__XPathResponse(//form[@name='countryForm']//select[@name='country']/option\n[text()='Czech Republic'])/@value}\n     - extracts value attribute of option element that match text 'Czech \nRepublic'. It is very handy feature when we know text of option element but \nneed to get its value (usually some numerical id from database).\n\nBugs/notes:\n * no DOM caching - DOM tree is created on every function invocation \n * need to do better exception handling\n\nIt would be nice to have handy response.getDataAsDomHtml() or similar to create \nDOM on demand for every possible caller (XPathAssertion, XPathResponse etc..), \nbut currently I have no idea, what would be acceptable solution.\n\nAny idea?", "id": 81467, "time": "2005-10-20T15:35:10Z", "bug_id": 37183, "creation_time": "2005-10-20T15:35:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hpaluch@gitus.cz", "text": "Created attachment 16764\nXPathResponse-rel-2-1.patch\n\nNew __XPathResponse function to extract data from response using XPath query.", "id": 81468, "time": "2005-10-20T15:37:00Z", "bug_id": 37183, "creation_time": "2005-10-20T15:37:00Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 16764}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37183, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 81475, "time": "2005-10-20T18:59:01Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-10-20T18:59:01Z", "text": "Sounds like a useful idea - but would it not be easier to use as a\nPost-Processor instead?
