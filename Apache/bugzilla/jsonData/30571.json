[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nthe current ant tasks don't allow to connect to an https webdav url.\nWhen I use a dav task and specify the url property as starting with \"https://...\"\nant complains about an 'invalid uri'.\nIf I modify the uri to start with http:// the server would send a redirect to\nhttps and the ant task bails out with this error message:\n\n10.08.2004 21:10:13 org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase processRedirect\nResponse\nINFO: Redirect requested but followRedirects is disabled\n\n--\n\nIt would also be nice if client cert authentification was supported.\n\n--\n\nLast but not least, I'd like to say that I dislike the fact that every ant task\ncomes with connection properties like url, username, password.\nThis way, ant has to reconnnect and reauthenticate with the server for each\noperation. Therefore I'd like to propose to have one Ant task wich constitutes a\n webdav session and that all the other ant tasks can reference this\nauthentication context.\n\nMaybe like this:\n\n<dav:authContext name=\"session1\" url=\"...\" username=\"...\" password=\"...\" />\n<dav:get context=\"session1\">\n    ....\n</dav:get>\n\n\nThanks", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 30571, "id": 61776, "time": "2004-08-10T19:34:40Z", "creator": "wtff@freenet.de", "creation_time": "2004-08-10T19:34:40Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30571, "attachment_id": null, "text": "The first one I try to fix for the 2.1 release.\n\nAbout the 2nd one, I don't know whether the HttpClient supports this.\n\nSomething like the 3rd I always thought about (some time ago).
