I've got this setup on both Linux x86 and Win2000.  I have implemented a \nfilter to log inbound requests, but whenever I call request.getHost(), all I \nget back is the IP addess of the server, instead of the host of the request \noriginator with 4.0.1. I suspect that it is taking that IP address of the \nApache server. With 4.0.2b1, it returned null! \n\nI know also that there is a bug report open about that getHost returns the IP \naddress instead of resolving the hostname, and what I read is that this should \nbe fixed in 4.0.2-b1, but when I tried this version, getHost returned null!\n\nThanks!\n\n-Richard", "id": 9381, "time": "2002-01-06T13:59:35Z", "creator": "rasand@attglobal.net", "creation_time": "2002-01-06T13:59:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5709, "attachment_id": null, "text": "With mod_jk 1.2.0 and tomcat 4.0.4, getRemoteHost still return\nnull and getRemoteAddr return correct IP.\n\nNo such problem with tomcat 3.3.1 or when using Tomcat 4 http \nconnector.\n\n", "id": 17981, "time": "2002-06-18T12:21:52Z", "creator": "hgomez@slib.fr", "creation_time": "2002-06-18T12:21:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5709, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Oups, still open\n\n", "id": 17982, "time": "2002-06-18T12:22:34Z", "creator": "hgomez@slib.fr", "creation_time": "2002-06-18T12:22:34Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "schoepf@web.de", "attachment_id": 2485, "id": 20189, "time": "2002-07-25T11:06:13Z", "bug_id": 5709, "creation_time": "2002-07-25T11:06:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 2485\nPatch, restores behavior of tomcat 3"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5709, "attachment_id": null, "id": 20190, "time": "2002-07-25T11:10:55Z", "creator": "schoepf@web.de", "creation_time": "2002-07-25T11:10:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "tomcat 3 has code in HttpServletRequestFacade.getRemoteHost() that tests whether\nthe remoteHost has already been set or not.
