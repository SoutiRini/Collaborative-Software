In the \nprocess we try putting $Catalina_home in the path for the base doc and that did not work. After that we \nfigured out that it will look inside the weapp dir automatically and our problem was fix.\n\nAfter this we noticed a folder called $CATALINA_HOME in the root dir for tomacat, we never created such a \ndir so we whent ahead and deleted it. For our surprise, that folder was linked to the root folder for tomcat \nand deleted everything. \n\nThe bug is that tomcat should not create any dir for you under any case. Or if it does we at least should be \nwarned."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39594, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 94300, "time": "2006-09-29T20:14:47Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-09-29T20:14:47Z", "text": "Tomcat creates directories for users all the time and would not work if it did not.\n\nI am afraid I do not fully understand your description but from what I do\nunderstand this is a combination of configuration error and unfortunate choice\nof incorrect configuration parameters rather than a bug."}]
