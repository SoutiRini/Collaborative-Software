I\ndon't understand why this is the only character in this range that was not\nescaped.  If this is an incorrect patch, please put in an explaination as to\nwhat character should be there.\n\nI'm not sure if it'll work, but what follows is my patch to fix this.  Since\nline 755 was an invalid DBCS, you may see something else on the 1.2 revision.\n\nIndex: src/org/apache/fop/fonts/Glyphs.java\n===================================================================\nRCS file: /home/cvspublic/xml-fop/src/org/apache/fop/fonts/Glyphs.java,v\nretrieving revision 1.2\ndiff -p -r1.2 Glyphs.java\n*** src/org/apache/fop/fonts/Glyphs.java        2001/02/27 12:28:15     1.2\n--- src/org/apache/fop/fonts/Glyphs.java        2001/04/19 01:51:27\n*************** public class Glyphs {\n*** 752,758 ****\n          ' ',\n          '\\u00a1',\n          '\\u00a2',\n!
