I think problem was introduced in releases 835183, 894018 and 892468, when corresponding classes were introduced.\n\nQuick-and-dirty solution was to implement clone with cloneViaReserialise. Seems to work, at least.\n\nAttached test-files plus test-code to re-produce problem, as well as patch for quick-and-dirty solution.", "is_private": false, "id": 138679, "creator": "antti.koskimaki@joinex.com", "time": "2010-07-26T12:13:12Z", "bug_id": 49649, "creation_time": "2010-07-26T12:13:12Z", "attachment_id": 25803}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49649, "attachment_id": null, "id": 138709, "time": "2010-07-28T11:53:26Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2010-07-28T11:53:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Applied in r980102\n\nYegor"}]
