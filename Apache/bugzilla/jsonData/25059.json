Without the patch several error messages appear. With the patch\nthey no longer appear, and almost correct output is obtained. The\nremaining irregularity in the output is addressed by my preceding\npatch.\n\n1. If prevBP == null, get text for hyphenation back from prev (last\nbreakposs in vecInlineBreaks).\n\n2. If prevBP == null, reset to prev.\n\nThese two formulations are conservative. If prevBP would always be\nequal to prev, the argument could simply be prev. However, apart from\nthe case prevBP == null at the start of a line, there is at least one\ncase in which prevBP is not the same as prev. Viz., if a bp is within\nthe line length (if (bpDim.min > availIPD.max) else) but !bBreakOK, bp\nis added to vecInlineBreaks, but prevBP is not set equal to it; in the\nnext iteration prevBP != prev. I do not know whether this is\nintentional or an error.\n\n3. Add the possibility to reset to a given breakposs.  reset() always\nuses prevBP to reset to; because getNextBreakPoss keeps prevBP equal\nto null when it starts a line, we also need to be able to reset to a\ngiven breakposs. If we overload reset, we get complaints about an\nambiguous reference reset(null). Note that reset(Position) is defined\nby AbstractLayoutManager, which does a different job.\n\nThis method also allows for its argument to be null.\n\nThe method reset() is reformulated in terms of the new method.\n\n4. Allow for the case prev == null.\n\n5. Allow for the case prev == null."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "spepping@apache.org", "attachment_id": 9323, "id": 48262, "time": "2003-11-27T20:58:19Z", "bug_id": 25059, "creation_time": "2003-11-27T20:58:19Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 9323\nThe patch file"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "spepping@apache.org", "attachment_id": 9324, "is_private": false, "id": 48263, "time": "2003-11-27T20:59:11Z", "bug_id": 25059, "creation_time": "2003-11-27T20:59:11Z", "text": "Created attachment 9324\nExample fo file"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 48325, "time": "2003-12-01T03:14:17Z", "bug_id": 25059, "creation_time": "2003-12-01T03:14:17Z", "text": "Simon, I'm looking at your patch now.
