Now, why not make it a\nrequired argument instead of an option ? Because we could add an other\ndata container, e.g. a DB, which would use excatly the same API (init,\ncset, commit etc). Here a path argument would not make sense, of\ncourse. This is what I meant with \"parent class\": whatever session\ncontainer we use, it will be created using\n\"web::sessioncontextfactory\", which defines the methods _parseargs,\ninit, new, commit, id, and _load and which creates the required, but\nnot yet implemented methods load, save, and invalidate (in java we\nwould use an \"interface\"). The \"derived classes\" then actually\nimplement these methods, as you can see in: web::filecontext (also in\nsessctx.ws3) and in cookie.ws3.\n", "id": 7769, "time": "2001-11-12T02:24:16Z", "bug_id": 4728, "creation_time": "2001-11-12T02:24:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "davidw@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 8468, "time": "2001-11-30T09:13:20Z", "bug_id": 4728, "creation_time": "2001-11-30T09:13:20Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Fixed by addition of code to make -path mandatory only in web::filecontext. \nError message reflects change."}]
