Making maven work seamleassly with log4j versions is imperitive for the development community to easily and quickly transition to new versions of the product.\n\nIf this is considered a \"Maven\" issue and it is not desired to push the fix from this end, that is unfortunate but understandable.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\nConcerned developer"}, {"text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 46589 ***", "tags": [], "creator": "gscokart@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 128215, "time": "2009-06-23T13:56:22Z", "bug_id": 46760, "creation_time": "2009-06-23T13:56:22Z", "attachment_id": null}]
