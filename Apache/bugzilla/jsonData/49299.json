Deploy it as cookiename.war\n2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/\n3. Actual result:\nThe page sends the following cookie:\n\nSet-Cookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\n\nbut the Reload link on the page uses \"jsessionid\":\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F\n\n4.

That could be a pain to fix. We currently do the mapping after we extract the session ID (and we'll need the context to figure out the right uri parameter name). We'll have to change that order.
