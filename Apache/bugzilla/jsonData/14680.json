Property files \nare a poor way to manage large text like websites (obviously).  So the \nPropertyResourceBundle is not practival for any application of big size.\n\nIt seems to me that the only practical solution is to support multiple \nlanguages in a website is by using XML.  The i18n tags should have an \nimplementation of ResourceBundle that gets text data from XML files.  This \nshould be easy to program.\n\nI think any programmer would agree with my suggestion.\n\nRegards", "id": 26578, "time": "2002-11-19T15:34:57Z", "creator": "cp1965@ROGERS.com", "creation_time": "2002-11-19T15:34:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14680, "attachment_id": null, "text": "JSTL replaced the i18n taglib, so this won't be worked on.", "id": 128693, "time": "2009-07-10T00:34:11Z", "creator": "bayard@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-07-10T00:34:11Z", "is_private": false}]
