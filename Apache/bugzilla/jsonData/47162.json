I don't want to add more insecure hash algorithms to htpasswd. But I would accept the use case of moving from LDAP-based authentication to file based authentication. But for that, only the verify (\"read\") support would be needed. Do you agree that verify support alone would be useful?", "bug_id": 47162, "is_private": false, "id": 162013, "time": "2012-09-07T19:41:39Z", "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "creation_time": "2012-09-07T19:41:39Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
