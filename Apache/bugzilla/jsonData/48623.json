[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "mod_authnz_ldap documentation says the first parameter to the AuthLDAPURL directive is an RFC2255 LDAP URI (the current relevant RFCs are 4516 and 4510), but the method which has been used for host failover breaks RFC compliance.\n\nMy mod_authnz_ldap, which came bundled with Red Hat Enterprise Linux v5.4 as part of their httpd-2.2.3-31.el5_4.2 package, requires this for syntax:\n\ntransport://host host host host host:port/dn?filter-etc\n\nthis is not RFC compliant, you cannot embed multiple hosts like that. This is a\nhack that prevents several commonplace LDAP failover usages.\n\nThis is the right way to do it:\n\ntransport://host:port/dn?filter-etc transport://host:port/dn?filter-etc\n\nFor example, in an arbitrarily complex two host failover setup:\n\nAuthLDAPURL ldap://127.0.0.1:9001/cn=mailboxes,dc=example,dc=edu?mailuid?one?objectclass=mailuser  ldaps://ldap.example.edu/ou=People,dc=example,dc=edu?uid?one?objectclass=posixAccount\n\n(Note, buzilla's probably wrapping that, it should all be on one line.)\n\nAny number of space-separated host specifications should be allowed, although three will be enough for most real-world use cases.\n\nSince RFC-compliant strings may contain spaces internally, quoting of individual host specifications must be allowed.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 48623, "id": 133950, "time": "2010-01-26T08:01:52Z", "creator": "medievalist@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-01-26T08:01:52Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48623, "text": "(This bug relates to previous discussion on bug 48505.)\n\nNot to hijack this bug report, but please also review the almost 3-year-old bug 44302 relating to ldapi:/// URLs as part of this.", "id": 142975, "time": "2010-12-28T16:18:39Z", "creator": "bugs@mark.ziesemer.com", "creation_time": "2010-12-28T16:18:39Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
