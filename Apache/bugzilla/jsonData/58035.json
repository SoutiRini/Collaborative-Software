This can result in invalid XML output by log4j, which in turn can cause XML parsers downstream to blow up.\n\nA corner case we encountered while using log4j v1.2.15 produced the attached XML output. The message, which usually has normal text, ended up having some illegal XML characters in it. Stylus Studio reports the error on line 2, column 119 as follows:\n  FATAL ERROR: Invalid character (Unicode: 0x15)\n\nThis character is indeed illegal in XML, as per:\nhttp://www.xml.com/axml/target.html#sec-cdata-sect\n\nA nice summary can be found here:\nhttp://www.coderanch.com/t/124970/XML/Invalid-Character-inside-CDATA\n\nXMLLayout should ensure that what it write is legal XML, either by escaping illegal characters, removing them, or replacing them.", "is_private": false, "id": 183527, "creation_time": "2015-06-14T21:47:35Z", "time": "2015-06-14T21:47:35Z", "creator": "120db@hotmail.es", "bug_id": 58035, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "garydgregory@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 183528, "time": "2015-06-14T23:25:57Z", "bug_id": 58035, "creation_time": "2015-06-14T23:25:57Z", "text": "What happens with 1.2.17?
