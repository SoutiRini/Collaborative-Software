The traditional way to do this is by using 3 threads with \"Run Thread Groups consecutively\".  Unfortunately, this highly constrains the flow of the test.\n\nA simple fix to this is to have 2 special Thread Group elements that will behave like normal Thread Groups except that they are executed before or after a test.  The idea here is that a \"Setup Thread Group\" can be used for activities like creating accounts, setup of test monitoring, ... etc.  The \"Post Thread Group\" would be for cleanup activities or even the posting of Test Results via a BSH Sampler or custom Java class.\n\nOverall, the idea behind this patch is to simplify the more advanced test plans with better organization and easier to follow flows.\n\nI will be Attaching a zip file and a patch.  The zip contains all the new additions to the source tree.\n\nThe patch includes the updates to the JMeter Engine and documentation.", "id": 142791, "time": "2010-12-16T16:02:42Z", "bug_id": 50490, "creation_time": "2010-12-16T16:02:42Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ansoni@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 26416\nPatch of JMeter Engine and documentation for fix", "id": 142792, "time": "2010-12-16T16:03:42Z", "bug_id": 50490, "creation_time": "2010-12-16T16:03:42Z", "attachment_id": 26416}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "ansoni@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 26417, "is_private": false, "id": 142793, "time": "2010-12-16T16:04:34Z", "bug_id": 50490, "creation_time": "2010-12-16T16:04:34Z", "text": "Created attachment 26417\nNew Files include classes and document images"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50490, "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks very much - a very useful enhancement.\n\nCode committed to SVN:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1050447&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 50490 - Setup and Post Thread Group enhancements for better test flow.\n\nAdded:\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/docs/images/screenshots/post_thread_group.png   (with props)\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/docs/images/screenshots/setup_thread_group.png   (with props)\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/threads/PostThreadGroup.java   (with props)\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/threads/SetupThreadGroup.java   (with props)\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/threads/gui/PostThreadGroupGui.java   (with props)\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/threads/gui/SetupThreadGroupGui.java   (with props)\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/xdocs/images/screenshots/post_thread_group.png   (with props)\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/xdocs/images/screenshots/setup_thread_group.png   (with props)\nModified:\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/bin/saveservice.properties\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/engine/StandardJMeterEngine.java\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/resources/messages.properties\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/xdocs/usermanual/component_reference.xml\n\n\nI had to make some changes to the StandardJMeterEngine code, as it was detecting end of test after the setup and post groups as well as after normal thread groups.
