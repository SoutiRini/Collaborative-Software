[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Currently there aren't any tests for mod_session in httpd-test. I believe having tests would greatly improve the ability to make fixes to mod_session in the future by providing a way to verify functionality and detect regressions.\n\nI'm including a patch for 21 tests that covers the directives, hooks, and optional functions that mod_session provides. It uses a test c-module that receives session data from the query string and saves session data to a response header. That way it doesn't have any dependencies on the session sub-modules.\n\nI've verified the tests pass in trunk and 2.4.x. In 2.2.x (where there is no mod_session) the tests are skipped. A subset of the tests are skipped if mod_include is not loaded.\n\nThere are two tests that fail with TODO because of PR 56052 and 58171.", "is_private": false, "id": 184128, "creator": "paul.spangler@ni.com", "time": "2015-07-22T16:05:50Z", "bug_id": 58172, "creation_time": "2015-07-22T16:05:50Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 32928\nProposed tests for mod_session", "creator": "paul.spangler@ni.com", "is_private": false, "id": 184129, "time": "2015-07-22T16:06:18Z", "bug_id": 58172, "creation_time": "2015-07-22T16:06:18Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 32928}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58172, "attachment_id": null, "id": 184212, "time": "2015-07-28T18:53:09Z", "creator": "Chaosed0@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-07-28T18:53:09Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Reviewed, looks good.
