[{"count": 0, "text": "Created attachment 22919\nWhen instructed to build APU against Berkeley DB 4.5, look for BDB 4.5, not for BDB 4.4.\n\nOverview:\n\nWhat seems like a copy-n-paste error in the M4 autotools stuff in srclib/apr-util/build/dbm.m4 causes APU's configure to fail to look for Berkeley DB 4.5 when told to do so.\nconfigure goes looking for Berkeley DB 4.4 instead, even though I explicitly said --with-dbm=db45.\nPatch attached.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nAttempt to build HTTPd 2.0.63 against Berkeley DB 4.5 on a system that does not have Berkeley DB 4.4 installed.\n\nActual Results:\n\nBuild process stops due to failure to find Berkeley DB version 4.4, which is not installed.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nBuild process should successfully build APU (and thus also HTTPd) against installed and working copy of Berkeley DB 4.5 as instructed.\n(This actually occurs with attached patch applied.)\n\nBuild Date & Platform:\n\nBuilding HTTPd 2.0.63 (and bundled APU 0.9.15) from released source tarball on a Linux/x86 system. Building both in one ./configure/make step - ie not APR, then APU, then Apache separately.\n\nAdditional Builds and Platforms:\n\nProbably would occur on any other UNIX system, too; but I have not verified this.", "creator": "matthew.sanderson@lexisnexis.com.au", "attachment_id": 22919, "id": 122761, "time": "2008-11-23T22:27:53Z", "bug_id": 46273, "creation_time": "2008-11-23T22:27:53Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46273, "attachment_id": null, "id": 122763, "time": "2008-11-23T23:31:18Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-11-23T23:31:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Already fixed in 1.3, your patch is applied in the unlikely event there is\nanother 0.9.x legacy release.
