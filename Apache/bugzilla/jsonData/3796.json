[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3796, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I have an application that uses Xerces as its XML parser. I put Xerces in WEB-\nINF/lib, but if I try and use it (via JAXP) I get a ClassCastException. It \nlooks as if my 'classpath' has been corrupted by the crimson parser in \ntomcat\\common\\lib. I didn't have this problem in Tomcat 4.0b6 (not sure about \nthe later RC relases).\n\nTo reproduce this, try ans install struts-example with xerces. jar in \ntomcat\\webapps\\struts-example\\WEB-INF\\lib, you'll see a ClassCastException \nwhere the digester is trying to load a parser. It seems that digester gets the \nXerces SAX parser but Tomcat thinks it should have Crimson. I have the same \nissue (in my application) but with the DOM parser.", "id": 5959, "time": "2001-09-24T08:10:49Z", "creator": "kevinj@develop.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-24T08:10:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 6001, "time": "2001-09-25T09:09:19Z", "bug_id": 3796, "creation_time": "2001-09-25T09:09:19Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 3809 ***"}]
