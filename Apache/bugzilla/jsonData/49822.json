This is useful for scenarios where back-end cache affinity is more desirable than other load balancing methods.\n\nThis works by taking a hash of the req_uri + query_string, seeding the random number generator with this value, and using the first random number returned mod num_of_workers.  This will consistently send a given uri/query string to a particular worker.  If that worker is unavailable, fall back to default method.", "id": 139454, "time": "2010-08-25T12:28:50Z", "creator": "rfox@godaddy.com", "creation_time": "2010-08-25T12:28:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25938}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 25941, "creator": "rfox@godaddy.com", "is_private": false, "id": 139476, "time": "2010-08-25T17:23:39Z", "bug_id": 49822, "creation_time": "2010-08-25T17:23:39Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 25941\nPatch to add hash lb worker method\n\nPrevious patch was incomplete"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49822, "text": "Note the age of the patch.", "id": 200561, "time": "2017-09-01T14:42:26Z", "creator": "chris@christopherschultz.net", "creation_time": "2017-09-01T14:42:26Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
