If retrieving, \nit will keep on retrieving if the request is issued again.  This does not \nsimulate a real-life scenario.  What JMeter needs is a browser cache behavior. \nEach request should be set to retrieve all embedded resources and Jmeter should \nkeep track for each thread if a request for a resource has been made or not. If \nso, do not request again. That is if the headers do not indicate no cache.\n\nFor example, the test plan below.  On the first loop, the second HTTP Request B \nresources should not be requested again.
