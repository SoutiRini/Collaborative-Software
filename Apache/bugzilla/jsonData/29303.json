Unfortunately, my results withSVG images are very\ndifferent than my results with PNG and JPG. The SVGimages are not scaled\ncorrectly (I scale images of various sizes into animage area on my page. The\nreason for this is, that the PDFRenderer usesdifferent code for rendering SVG\nimages and other images and the PDFpath does not scale the image to the\nrequested size but simply puts theimage on the page (miscalculating the image\nposition during thisprocess).The attached patch against the 0.20.2-branch fixes\nthis behaviour. Withthis patch, a Visio chart saved as PNG and as SVG look the\nsame (exceptthat the SVG version gets scaled much better)."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hps@intermeta.de", "attachment_id": 11698, "id": 58413, "time": "2004-05-30T20:53:26Z", "bug_id": 29303, "creation_time": "2004-05-30T20:53:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 11698\nThis is the described patch"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "pascal.sancho@takoma.fr", "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 110800, "time": "2007-11-20T01:40:13Z", "bug_id": 29303, "creation_time": "2007-11-20T01:40:13Z", "text": "Visio add a white padding around the picture in SVG, not in PNG"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29303, "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs", "id": 156822, "time": "2012-04-01T13:53:24Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:53:24Z", "is_private": false}]
