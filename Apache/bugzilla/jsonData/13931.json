My Question is \nthat i am having three webapps that are discovered at runtime(so there is no \nentry regarding them in server.xml)in my application and i want to pass the \nSession between the contexts(i.e. *webapps*). \n    Please if someone can tell me where i will get sample code to code that \nstuff.. Since i know that we have to get the Context of the target webapps and \nthen get request dispatcher object from there and do .Forward to send it.But  \ncoudnt find any sample code on how to go about that. \nThanks a Lot in Advance\nGirish", "id": 25128, "time": "2002-10-24T13:56:52Z", "bug_id": 13931, "creation_time": "2002-10-24T13:56:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Sorry, but the bug database is for bug reports only.\n\nGuidelines and tips: http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/bugreport.html", "attachment_id": null, "id": 25129, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "time": "2002-10-24T14:04:06Z", "bug_id": 13931, "creation_time": "2002-10-24T14:04:06Z", "is_private": false}]
