Basically,\na clean url is using a / for a delimiter between variables instead of an & and\nreprocessing the data using php or some other scripting engine.  This technique\nis useful for 2 things on dynamic websites and previously worked when using\napache 1.x.  Those 2 things are; it allows indexing by search engines (search\nengines typically ignore variables) and can also be used for URL obfusication or\nsimplification.\n\nSince I'm terrible at explaining things, here is an example of a typical URL.\nhttp://servername/index.php?foo=var1&bar=var2\n\nAnd here is an example of the same URL using the \"Clean URL\" technique.\nhttp://servername/index.php/var1/var2\nor...\nhttp://servername/index.php/foo=var1/bar=var2\n\nThe above 2 URLs yeild a 404 error in apache 2.x when it should actually be\nexecuting index.php.  Apache 1.x will execute index.php without a problem.  A\nLOT of websites are starting to use this sort of technique or something similar,\nand it is the one thing that is keeping me from being able to move to apache 2.x\n(it breaks my whole template system).
