This takes out 5\nperfectly functioning web-apps on the disabled server.\n\nA scenario could occur where 1 buggy web-app takes out the entire cluster, where\nthe other 5 applications function perfectly.\n\nThe ideal:\n\nTreat fail_on_status as per mount - so only single web-apps on a particular\ntomcat worker get taken out when it activates.\n\nThanks for you efforts. If you need any help with testing, I have a few large\nmulti-platform Tomcat farms.\n\nregards\n\nJames Masson", "id": 108990, "time": "2007-10-04T09:26:25Z", "creator": "james_masson@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2007-10-04T09:26:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43553, "attachment_id": null, "id": 180102, "time": "2014-12-31T15:05:01Z", "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2014-12-31T15:05:01Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This was implemented in the meantime.
