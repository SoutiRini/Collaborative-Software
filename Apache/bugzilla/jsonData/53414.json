[{"count": 0, "text": "Our excel generation is based on templates where we duplicate rows and columns as necessary to fit the data that is fed into them. In this particular usecase we add 23 rows and one column. Our counterparty uses jxl 2.5.5 to parse the incoming xls files generated by our poi setup. The added rows do not pose a problem but the added column does. The problem is that the values in the added column are not parsed and instead jxl outputs warnings:\n\nWarning: Cell D1 exceeds defined cell boundaries in Dimension record (3x42)\nWarning: Cell D2 exceeds defined cell boundaries in Dimension record (3x42)\nWarning: Cell D3 exceeds defined cell boundaries in Dimension record (3x42)\nWarning: Cell D4 exceeds defined cell boundaries in Dimension record (3x42)\nWarning: Cell D5 exceeds defined cell boundaries in Dimension record (3x42)\n\nYou will note that more recent version of jxl do parse the excel correctly but only because they adjusted their error handling. The excels generated by apache poi still seem to have the wrong dimension.\n\nUpdating the org.apache.poi.hssf.model.InternalSheet.addValueRecord() method from if (col.getColumn() > d.getLastCol())  to if (col.getColumn() >= d.getLastCol()) fixes the problem in our usecase.", "bug_id": 53414, "attachment_id": null, "id": 159991, "time": "2012-06-14T06:50:45Z", "creator": "i8c.alex@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-06-14T06:50:45Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53414, "text": "Created attachment 28939\nImplements the suggested fix", "id": 159992, "time": "2012-06-14T06:51:34Z", "creator": "i8c.alex@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-06-14T06:51:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 28939}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53414, "is_private": false, "text": "Any chance you upload a junit test case for your patch? \n\nRegards,\nYegor", "id": 159995, "time": "2012-06-14T07:02:27Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2012-06-14T07:02:27Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "i8c.alex@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 28940, "text": "Created attachment 28940\nTestcode that produces an excel that contains the wrong dimensions", "id": 159996, "time": "2012-06-14T07:25:58Z", "bug_id": 53414, "creation_time": "2012-06-14T07:25:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53414, "text": "Please note that if you open the generated xls file in excel, it automatically fixes the dimension issue (judging from the last modified even without explicitly hitting save)", "id": 159997, "time": "2012-06-14T07:54:49Z", "creator": "i8c.alex@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-06-14T07:54:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "i8c.alex@gmail.com", "text": "Any progress on this issue?
