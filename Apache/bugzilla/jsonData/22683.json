Gif and \nother formats are OK. Jpeg doesn't work. I tried to install the 1.3.26 and it \nworks fine.\n\nfor example if I put an jpeg image to htdocs, it doesn't open it.\nhttp://localhost/image.jpg doesn't work.\nhttp://localhost/image.gif, png, everything else works.\n\nSystem config:\n\nWindows XP SP2\nAthlon XP 2200 +\n512 mb ram\n\nSincerely,\nTomas Selnekovic", "id": 43217, "time": "2003-08-24T18:50:24Z", "creator": "tomas@runway.sk", "creation_time": "2003-08-24T18:50:24Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "erik@codefaktor.de", "attachment_id": null, "id": 43520, "time": "2003-08-31T19:11:40Z", "bug_id": 22683, "creation_time": "2003-08-31T19:11:40Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Hmm, perhaps there is a problem with your mime-type settings or even a broken JPEG file but I'm \npretty sure that JPEGs are working fine with 2.0.47 on XP; otherwise there would be much more \nbug-reports :)\n\nYou can try to trace the HTTP headers and see if there are any indicators of what's going on. \nPerhaps it also helps to disable the sendfile support (EnableSendfile Off) and to make sure that the \nfiles are not served off of a networked filesystem like NFS or SMB. Another possibility could be \nmod_mime_magic, try to disable it if it is enabled. Ahh, and btw, don't forget to have look in the \nerror log...\n\nI'm marking this bug as invalid now, but please feel free to re-open it if you can come up with \nsome more information and after experimenting with the suggestions above."}]
