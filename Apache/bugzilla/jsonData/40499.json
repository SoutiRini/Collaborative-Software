[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40499, "text": "It would be useful to perform abortive connection release (i.e. sending a TCP\nRST instead of FIN) in JMeter. This is useful to prevent large numbers of\nsockets sitting around with a TIME_WAIT status. OpenSTA has a feature that\nallows this (in TestExecutor_web.ini under the [Sockets] section, the Linger\nproperty can be set to 0).\n\nJava (well, the Sun JVM anyway, I'm not sure about others) allows us to perform\nan abortive connection release by setting socket lingering to on, and the socket\nlinger time to 0 (using the Socket.setSoLinger method -- see\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/articles/connection_release.html).\n\nThe Jakarta Commons HTTP Client allows the socket linger time to be set to 0\n(using the http.socket.linger property) so this should be a relatively easy fix.\nHowever there appears to be a bug that prevents socket lingering from being\nturned-on when the linger time is set to 0 (I've raised this, see:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-599).", "id": 93523, "time": "2006-09-13T15:45:28Z", "creator": "neilf@touchclarity.com", "creation_time": "2006-09-13T15:45:28Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40499, "attachment_id": null, "id": 151467, "time": "2011-11-14T12:14:09Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2011-11-14T12:14:09Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Still not implemented in 2.5.1"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40499, "attachment_id": null, "id": 164189, "time": "2012-12-20T22:33:35Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-12-20T22:33:35Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 54230 ***"}]
