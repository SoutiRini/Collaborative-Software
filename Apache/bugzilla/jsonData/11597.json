When a \"real\"  \nattribute precedes a namespace declaration in an element start tag, and the \nName of the element or of an attribute is the same as the QName of the parent \nelement or one of its attributes, then the namespace URI assigned to the name \nmay be based on the namespace declarations in force for the parent element \nrather than those for the child element.\"\n\nMichael Kay", "id": 20857, "time": "2002-08-09T19:24:29Z", "bug_id": 11597, "creation_time": "2002-08-09T19:24:29Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
