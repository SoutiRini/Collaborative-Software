As noted in the 7.0 changelog, the related bug report can be found here:\n\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50026\n\nThe normal way to correctly implement this is to place the static content under a known, real location, and configure that in <url-pattern>.  Alternatively, a filter can be used to detect static references and forward them to the DefaultServlet.  One could also use the appropriate suffix notation in the <url-pattern> to direct requests to the DefaultServlet.\n\n - Chuck"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50153, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 50026 ***", "id": 141056, "time": "2010-10-26T08:46:27Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-26T08:46:27Z", "is_private": false}]
