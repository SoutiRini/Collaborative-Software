Firefox works fine but Chrome doesn't.  I tested with JMeter 2.5, 2.7 and 2.9 and all 3 versions, FF works but Chrome doesn't.\n\nI followed the instructions in the jmeter_proxy_step_by_step.pdf file\n(http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_proxy_step_by_step.pdf) to setup my proxy server in JMeter and my browsers to use the proxy servers.\n\nFrom the instructions, I created\n1) HTTP Request Defaults to hmeter.apache.org\n2) Recording Controller\n3) HTTP Proxy Server, including all elements, not just *.html\n4) Start the Proxy server\n\nThe only difference in setup between the two browsers is when I changed the proxy settings.  In FF, I went thru FireFox->Preferences->Network->Settings->Manual proxy configuration to change the proxy to my localhost and port 8080.  When I use the browser, it captures the traffic and sends to the Recording Controller\n\nIn Chrome, it uses the global Network settings (System Preferences->Network->Advanced->Proxies->Web Proxy (HTTP).  Web Proxy server = localhost, port = 8080.  When I use Chrome, no traffic gets captured in the Recording Controller.\n\nI've set the severity to normal but we can drop the severity down if needed since there's a workaround (use FF since it works).\n\nI'm using Mac 10.7.5 on a MacBook Pro."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55571, "attachment_id": null, "id": 170179, "time": "2013-09-19T18:44:00Z", "creator": "jeff_at_ucd2@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2013-09-19T18:44:00Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Forgot to mention,\nChrome is 29.0.1547.65\nFF is 23.0.1"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55571, "attachment_id": null, "id": 170194, "time": "2013-09-20T19:38:54Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-09-20T19:38:54Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Does Chrome still work if you stop the JMeter Proxy?\n\nIf so, it is not actually using the proxy.\nMake sure it is not set to ignore the proxy for local addresses.\n\nAnd make sure the cache is emptied before you start recording."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55571, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Using Mac Book Pro 10.6.8 and Chrome 29.0.1547.76 I don't reproduce issue, it works for me.", "id": 170211, "time": "2013-09-22T13:30:58Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2013-09-22T13:30:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": 30872, "id": 170212, "time": "2013-09-22T13:31:31Z", "bug_id": 55571, "creation_time": "2013-09-22T13:31:31Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 30872\nNetwork configuration for recording"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55571, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Try emptying URL Patterns to include, I suspect a misconfiguration of this part.", "id": 170213, "time": "2013-09-22T13:32:44Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2013-09-22T13:32:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55571, "text": "Yes, Chrome still works even when the proxy is off.
