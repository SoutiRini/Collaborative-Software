We've been running this patch in FreeSWITCH's version of APR for years and would like to see it included upstream if possible.  Please let us know your thoughts and if any changes are appropriate we'll be happy to make them and propose a revised patch.\n\nThe patch series being proposed here is also available on the master branch of this repository:\n\n  https://github.com/traviscross/apr/\n\nAuthor: Travis Cross <tc@traviscross.com>\nDate:   Sun May 25 19:57:44 2014 +0000\n\n    Add apr_pool_mutex_set()\n    \n    This commit allows adding a mutex to a pool to make low level\n    allocations thread-safe.\n    \n    FreeSWITCH users running large production systems have been using this\n    technique for over five years without incident.\n    \n    Since the fork, we've added in tree debugging code to check for\n    contentious use of a pool.  Here we're able to use those hooks to\n    reduce the size of the present commit.\n    \n    Signed-off-by: Anthony Minessale <anthm@freeswitch.org>\n    Signed-off-by: Travis Cross <tc@traviscross.com>", "is_private": false, "id": 177708, "creator": "tc+asf@travislists.com", "time": "2014-09-10T18:45:46Z", "bug_id": 56947, "creation_time": "2014-09-10T18:45:46Z", "attachment_id": 31988}]
