Note that a regular expression match will work, however.  This\nbehavior has been observed in 3 of 8 randomly selected pptx downloaded from the\ninternet.  However, document identification seems to work just fine, so the\nonly way that some one using the new POI engine would be affected is if they\nwere decomposing attachments and searching for a simple string in them (and\nthey would only be affected on PowerPoint 2007 documents).
