I've repeated it myself, it works\nfor me.\n\nTomcat's other connectors are very capable of handling large numbers of\nconnections.  In addition to trying the latest native connector (1.1.8 at the\ntime of this writing, with many improvements since 1.1.3), you may want to at\nleast test and benchmark the default Java connectors.  They've worked well for\nmany people with large systems for years now."}]
