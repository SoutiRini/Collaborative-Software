However, this method normalizes \"/\" into \"\". As a consequence, the method isDirectory() returns false for this entry.\n\nRationale: A TarEntry with the name \"/\" is created by TrueZIP 6.7 (https://truezip.dev.java.net) as a virtual root directory. This TarEntry is actually never written to the TAR file, but solely used in order to associate meta data with the TAR file itself. Later on, the last modification time of this virtual root directory is used to post-fix the last modification time of the TAR file itself.\n\nWork-around: Call the newly introduced constructor public TarEntry(String name, boolean preserveLeadingSlashes) with true as its boolean parameter."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This issue has also been filed to TrueZIP's Issue Tracker: https://truezip.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=36", "attachment_id": null, "id": 139071, "creator": "christian@schlichtherle.de", "time": "2010-08-12T09:21:30Z", "bug_id": 49744, "creation_time": "2010-08-12T09:21:30Z", "is_private": false}]
