Apache has been configured to \nuse conf/weblogic.conf to forward requests to WLS61 or WLS81. \n\nWith the application deployed under WLS81 and the forwarding information is in \nthe weblogic.conf. When the user has logged on correctly and clicks a button \nthat requests database information he is taken back to the logon page. I have \nbeen told by the developer that this is the result of the application testing \nwhether the user has logged on correctly before displaying database information.\n\nIf the forwarding information is left in the httpd.conf as if one application \nis being forwarded it works.\nIF the application is delployed under WLS61 and the same weblogic.conf file is \nused, the application works fine.\nThe problem only occurs only when the Apache plugin is configured to obtain \nforwarding rules to WebLogicServer8.1 from the file conf/weblogic.conf. \n\nThis may well be a weblogic issue, but any assistance will be great.\n\nThanks\nNizan", "id": 57955, "time": "2004-05-24T12:24:57Z", "bug_id": 29173, "creation_time": "2004-05-24T12:24:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "This is not a WebLogic support forum, please only file bugs in Apache httpd\nhere.
