[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25750, "text": "When running Tomcat 4.1.27 as an NT service, if you have a JSP that uses the \n<html:file> tag, Internet Explorer intermittently and frequently \ngenerates \"Cannot find server\" errors and does not submit the HTTP request. \nThis occurs whether you're uploading a file or not. Just the fact that the \n<html:file> tag exists appears to cause the problem.
