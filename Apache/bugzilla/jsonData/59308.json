There are about 70 criterias, but if 2 of them are checked, the export freezes. These two creterias are related to a diesel price matrix, that is uploaded from excel format in Eclipse and then in the DB. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas where the issue might be? The company updated the MS Office from 2007 to 2013. \n\nI would apreciate any ideas.\n\nThanks,\nRares"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59308, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please use the mailing list for general usage questions as bugzilla is intended for actual bug-reports. \n\nAlso you surely will need to include a lot more details about why you think Apache POI is even related here to give anybody else a chance of suggesting anything here, e.g. how is the code writing to Excel files, how is Apache POI used here, what do you mean with \"freezes\", did you take a look at thread dumps, ...", "id": 190181, "time": "2016-04-12T10:13:14Z", "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2016-04-12T10:13:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "hrrares@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks Dominik.
