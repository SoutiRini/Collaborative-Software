Even non newbie can get trapped.\n\nShouldn't we introduce this to avoid hanging test that give a feeling of broken JMeter while the problem is in the hanging targetted server ?:\n\n- Option 1: Add an option in Scheduler part called \"Interrupt pending Threads after duration + security margin (1m) that could be a field or property\" on Thread Group (checked by default)\n- Option 2 : Add it at test plan level to avoid repeating the configuration\n    On start of Thread Group, an additional TimerTask would be triggered after duration + security margin and would do the following:\n        run equivalent (refactor) of code at:\n           - https://github.com/apache/jmeter/blob/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/engine/StandardJMeterEngine.java#L326"}]
