[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The Ant 1.6.2 documentation for the vmlauncher attribute of the <exec> task\nsays:\n\n\"Run command using the Java VM's execution facilities where available. If set \nto false the underlying OS's shell, either directly or through the antRun \nscripts, will be used. Under some operating systems, this gives access to \nfacilities not normally available through the VM including, under Windows, \nbeing able to execute scripts, rather than their associated interpreter. If \nyou want to specify the name of the executable as a relative path to the \ndirectory given by the dir attribute, it may become necessary to set \nvmlauncher to false as well.\"\n\nThis implies that setting vmlauncher=\"false\" will allow a relative pathname\nin the executable attribute.  However, bug #3129 which is marked as \"RESOLVED\nWON'T FIX\", clearly indicates that, on at least some platforms, an absolute\npath is required in the executable attribute.  For me, with vmlauncher=\"false\",\na relative path for executable=\"\" is fine on RH Linux, but I'm required to use \nan absolute path in the executable=\"\" attribute on Solaris 8/9.\n\nI would suggest that either a Solaris-specific warning be included (similar to\nthe OS-specific warnings for Cygwin/OpenVMS/Redhat S390) or, maybe better yet,\nthe \"trick\" of using <property name=\"executable-full-path\" \nlocation=\"../relative/path/to/executable\"/> be included in the examples\nas a way of insuring that <exec executable=\"${executable-full-path}\" ... />\nwill work properly.\n\nThanks for your consideration,\n\nJohn Shott", "is_private": false, "id": 71869, "creator": "shott@snf.stanford.edu", "time": "2005-03-05T18:52:14Z", "bug_id": 33864, "creation_time": "2005-03-05T18:52:14Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 33864, "is_private": false, "id": 118728, "time": "2008-07-16T08:56:32Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-07-16T08:56:32Z", "tags": [], "text": "I think resolveExecuteable=\"true\" will help\n\nsome more prose has been added with svn revision 677317."}]
