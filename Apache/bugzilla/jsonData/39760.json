When\n  did this change?\n\n  We actually had a dialog with the VP over there (each language team sets it's\n  own direction as far as adoption is concerned.)  See the dev@ list archives\n  for details.\n\n  In any case, unless the code you build is free()ing memory allocated by APR,\n  or malloc()'ing memory freed by APR, or exchanging system objects that \n  are actually clib (msvcr) objects (e.g. a FILE * object), there really should \n  -not- be an interoperability issue.  If one exists that I didn't just \n  describe, some citation would be appreciated.\n\n  The decision will be revisted in the release 2.4.0.  We maintain binary\n  compatibility throughout the ver maj.min release history.  As said bring\n  this up on dev@."}]
