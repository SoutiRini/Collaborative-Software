[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "mludha@gmail.com", "text": "I'm a software developer at ESET and I believe I've found a bug in Apache running on Windows (but not on Linux) that presents both a compatibility issue between ESET line of security products and a huge potential for DoS of Apache. The simplest way to demonstrate this is\n1. Download http://de.apachehaus.com/downloads/httpd-2.4.23-x86-vc11.zip, unzip\n2. Run httpd.exe\n3. Verify that https://127.0.0.1 loads (proceed despite certificate warnings)\n4. Run nc 127.0.0.1 443\n5. Open https://127.0.0.1 again\n6. Observe that the page loads for basically forever\n7. Kill nc, observe that the page loads shortly after\n\nThis leads me to believe that holding a single https connection open to Apache running on Windows without sending client hello is enough to prevent the server from responding to any new connections.
