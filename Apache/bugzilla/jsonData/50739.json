I think Inkscape-designed SVGs (or all of them?) have eight bits per component colors, so for example with PNGs I'm imagining scaling those up to the 16-bit range and rendering from there. My interest here is in having smooth gradients or blurs over larger portions of images rather than the banding one gets with Inkscape export (and this is for a nonvisual but rather computational purpose that involves computing derivatives of the image).\n\nI tried to hack it myself, but I'm hoping that someone more familiar with the code can actually get it done.
