This leads to undesirable results when the output is very long; if I'm writing an Ant buildfile and would like output to be redirected to a file, in 99.99% of the cases I would *not* like to see that very same output in stdout, especially when that output is long.\n\nI suggest adding a property called \"suppressStdout\" (defaults to \"false\") to control this.\n\nI have attached a patch to SSHExec; regrettably can't afford the time to thoroughly test it but it looks simple enough."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50270, "attachment_id": 29939, "id": 165190, "time": "2013-02-12T07:00:33Z", "creator": "schigurupati@triniti.com", "creation_time": "2013-02-12T07:00:33Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 29939\nA complete tested SSHExec class with suppressSystemOut attribute\n\nMy sincere contribution to Apache to resolve this bug"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "committed.
