Ensure that this file is owned by userA and group writeable - I used 664 as the permissions mask.\n2. As userB, run an ant script containing <touch file=\"foo.txt\" />.\n\nThe script will execute fully, but fail silently - the failure result coming back from the java.io.File.setLastModified call inside touch is ignored. The failure in this case is appropriate; however, the user should be alerted to the issue.", "id": 137790, "time": "2010-06-21T21:25:20Z", "creator": "mike.dobozy@amentra.com", "creation_time": "2010-06-21T21:25:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49485, "attachment_id": null, "text": "starting with svn revision 957442 Ant logs a warning message.", "id": 137865, "time": "2010-06-24T03:40:13Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-06-24T03:40:13Z", "is_private": false}]
