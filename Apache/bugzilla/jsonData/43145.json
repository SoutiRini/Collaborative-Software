Since the FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING\nwas first introduced in JDK 5 (1.5), this problem still exists when running\non JDKs prior to 5. Therefore, there will be a runtime check that will disable\nthe XSLT transform if not running on JDK 5 or higher. This may affect\ncompatibility, but since this is a serious issue and there is a workaround\n(upgrading to JDK 5) I believe this is the most appropriate fix.", "id": 106827, "time": "2007-08-16T09:36:57Z", "creator": "sean.mullan@oracle.com", "creation_time": "2007-08-16T09:36:57Z", "is_private": false}]
