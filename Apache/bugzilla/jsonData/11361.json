The problem occurs because I have an \nin memory DOMSource object that I need to pass to my xsl stylesheet as a \nparameter. To do this I have had to create my own URIResolver that will store a \nSource object (i.e. my DOMSource). This Source object is then returned when the \nappropriate URI is passed to the URIResolver resolve method. However, within \nXTags there is currently no way to use your own URIResolver. \n\nTo solve the problem I have added an optional \"uriResolver\" attribute to \nthe \"style\" tag. Therefore, the StyleTag class has a new field,\n\n\tprivate URIResolver uriResolver;\n\nand a setter method for that field,\n\n\tpublic void setUriResolver(URIResolver uriResolver) {\n\t\tthis.uriResolver = uriResolver;\n\t}\n\t\nIn the doEndTag method the line,\n\n\tfactory.setURIResolver( createURIResolver() );\n\t\nhas expanded to become,\n\n\tif (uriResolver == null) {\n\t\turiResolver = createURIResolver();\n\t}\n\tfactory.setURIResolver( uriResolver );\n\t\nThis allows me to use my own URIResolver and solve the problem. Would it be \npossible to add this functionality to XTags?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11361, "attachment_id": null, "id": 132437, "time": "2009-11-29T19:44:44Z", "creator": "bayard@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-11-29T19:44:44Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Resolving.
