The JPG files generated on the web server can be \nopened with no problem and looks fine, however the image presented on the web \nclient is garbled. I have saved the image at the web client and file compared \nit in binary mode to the jpeg on the server and it appears that ascii \ncharacter 63  or ? is sporadically overwriting bytes in the jpeg data stream. \nEnough to corrupt the whole image. Note the file size of the server JPG and \nthe client saved JPG are identical.\n\nHave you any ideas what could be causing this?\n\nMany thanks in advance\nNeil Fuller"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "admin@knowitsoft.com", "text": "Plese e-mail neil.fuller@vodafone.co.uk during the week", "id": 36785, "time": "2003-05-06T22:36:17Z", "bug_id": 19704, "creation_time": "2003-05-06T22:36:17Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "admin@knowitsoft.com", "text": "please email me on neil.fuller@vodafone.co.uk when fixed", "id": 36786, "time": "2003-05-06T22:37:01Z", "bug_id": 19704, "creation_time": "2003-05-06T22:37:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 5704 ***", "id": 51970, "time": "2004-02-09T01:53:00Z", "bug_id": 19704, "creation_time": "2004-02-09T01:53:00Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
