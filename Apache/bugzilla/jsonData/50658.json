[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50658, "text": "Hello,\n\nI need a imformation of xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar. Why this api jars is not a part of Apache ANT 1.8.2 binary package. Because of that i am getting the \"Could not load org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser: SAX2 driver class org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser not found: org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser\" error when custom ant task is trying to load a org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser using SAXBuilder of JDOM1.1.1. I had raised a bug with all detail in bugzilla with id: 50652. \nAfter placing the jars (xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar) of Apache ANT 1.7.1 on Apache ANT 1.8.2 lib this error is resolve. Even I have given the location of xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar in classpath when defining the taskdef for custom ant task its not working. \n\nThanks\nAshish Soni", "id": 143651, "time": "2011-01-26T01:34:35Z", "creator": "ashish.soni@siemens.com", "creation_time": "2011-01-26T01:34:35Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50658, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi, \n\nIt's clear from LICENSE file that SAX 2.0 lib no more the part of Apache ANT 1.8.1 and afterward version.\n\n\"I hereby abandon any property rights to SAX 2.0 (the Simple API for\nXML), and release all of the SAX 2.0 source code, compiled code, and\ndocumentation contained in this distribution into the Public Domain.\nSAX comes with NO WARRANTY or guarantee of fitness for any\npurpose.\"\n\nNow question is that \"why ANT is not picking the SAX 2.0 from taskdef classpath\".\n\nThanks\nAshish Soni", "id": 143661, "time": "2011-01-26T09:46:49Z", "creator": "ashish.soni@siemens.com", "creation_time": "2011-01-26T09:46:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "*** Bug 50652 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 143664, "time": "2011-01-26T10:38:24Z", "bug_id": 50658, "creation_time": "2011-01-26T10:38:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "text": "You are reading way too much into the SAX2 license.\n\nAnt's binary distributions used to ship xml-apis and Xerces as a convenience\nto make sure there was a namespace aware XML parser around.
