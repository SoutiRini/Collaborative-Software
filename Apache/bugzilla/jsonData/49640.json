These defined names may be present in a formula (e.g. =SUM(F15:F16)+_GP108).  In the previous example _GP108 is a defined name beginning with an underscore.  \n\nFormulaParser fails to process the defined name in the previous example because the parseNonRange(int) function only tests whether the defined name begins with a letter.  This occurs when processing xssf workbooks only.\n\nThe attached patch modifies the test for the defined name starting character to accept underscores.", "id": 138639, "time": "2010-07-22T17:31:31Z", "bug_id": 49640, "creation_time": "2010-07-22T17:31:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25795}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49640, "text": "Applied in r979329\n\nYegor", "id": 138678, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2010-07-26T11:53:56Z", "time": "2010-07-26T11:53:56Z", "is_private": false}]
