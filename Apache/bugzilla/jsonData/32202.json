I have changed this to 2048 and \nfind the resulting ab tool works all the time.\n\nSo I recommend that you change CBUFFSIZE from 512 to 2048 in src/support/ab.c\n\nThanks\n\nRichard Chen", "id": 66802, "time": "2004-11-12T16:03:55Z", "creator": "richard@doubleprime.com", "creation_time": "2004-11-12T16:03:55Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Try Apache Flood:\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/test/flood/", "id": 66803, "time": "2004-11-12T16:15:59Z", "bug_id": 32202, "creation_time": "2004-11-12T16:15:59Z", "is_private": false}]
