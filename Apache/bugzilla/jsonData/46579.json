The problem is that SetEnvironmentVariable is setting the variable globally in IIS. So, when multiple ISAPI redirector dlls are installed the value of the directory is which ever the last one that modified it. Normally, when IIS is started or restarted the ISAPIs are initialized in order so the these variable works correctly in the properties files.\n\n# Use the logs in the installation path of ISAPI Redirector\nlog_file=$(ISAPI_PATH)\\$(ISAPI_NAME).log\n\nHowever, when an ISAPI redirect is reloaded it sometimes writes to a log file of another ISAPI instance. Worse is that it reads the URI mapping rules from another instance.\n\nThis problem has basically made the ISAPI_PATH variable useless in environments where multiple instances of the ISAPI redirector are used on one machine.\n\nI have summitted a enhancement request that would remove the need to used this variables by using the relative path of the dll/properties file when a path is not specified.\n\nlog_file=$(ISAPI_NAME).log\n\nTIA,\nEugenio Alvarez", "id": 124250, "time": "2009-01-21T14:26:58Z", "bug_id": 46579, "creation_time": "2009-01-21T14:26:58Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46579, "text": "Fixed in the SVN (r739519)\n", "id": 124551, "time": "2009-01-30T23:42:15Z", "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-01-30T23:42:15Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
