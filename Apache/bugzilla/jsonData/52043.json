[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52043, "text": "Created attachment 27799\nPatch file to address shortcomings in mod_ftp \"ls\" command handling\n\nThe FTP client commands \"ls .\", \"ls ..\", and \"ls /\" do not work in a way consistent with the unix shell commands.\n\nFrom the top-level FTP directory, a \"550\" status \"No such file or directory\" is returned for each of these.  From a subdirectory one-level deep on the FTP server, the \"ls .\" shows the contents of the current directory while \"ls ..\" and \"ls /\" still return the 550 status.  From a subdirectory two or more levels deep, \"ls .\" and \"ls ..\" work but \"ls /\" returns a 550.\n\nWith the attached patch incorporated and built, the commands \"ls .\", \"ls ..\", \"ls /\", as well as  \"ls ./<someDirectory>\", \"ls ../<someDirectory>\", \"ls /<someDirectory>\", and ls <someDirectory> work in a way consistent with the linux/unix shell \"ls\" command for the testing I've done.", "id": 150676, "time": "2011-10-17T18:24:05Z", "creator": "phil.pickett@springsource.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-17T18:24:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 27799}]
