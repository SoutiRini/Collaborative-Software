We are using spnego.sourceforge.net solution for enabling SSO on tomcat end. Now, desktop SSO works charm.\n\nNow we would like to front tomcat with APache and use mod_jk for connecting. We have Apache 2.2.15, mod_jk 1.2.30 on Tomcat 6.0.24. As such apache & mod_jk is working fine with tomcat when SSO is turned off on tomcat i.e apache and mod_jk have been configured properly. \n\nWhen i turn on SSO on tomcat, i get error when going through Apache but when i hit tomcat directly i don't get any error.\n\nHere is the error i'm getting\nGSSException: Failure unspecified at GSS-API level (Mechanism level: Checksum failed)\n\tsun.security.jgss.krb5.Krb5Context.acceptSecContext(Unknown Source)\n\tsun.security.jgss.GSSContextImpl.acceptSecContext(Unknown Source)\n\tsun.security.jgss.GSSContextImpl.acceptSecContext(Unknown Source)\n\tsun.security.jgss.spnego.SpNegoContext.GSS_acceptSecContext(Unknown Source)\n\tsun.security.jgss.spnego.SpNegoContext.acceptSecContext(Unknown Source)\n\tsun.security.jgss.GSSContextImpl.acceptSecContext(Unknown Source)\n\tsun.security.jgss.GSSContextImpl.acceptSecContext(Unknown Source)\n\n\nDoes it mean that i need to tweak some configuration on apache and mod_jk to work with tomcat when sso is enabled?\n\nPlease help\n\nRegards\nKB", "id": 137362, "time": "2010-06-04T12:25:36Z", "bug_id": 49389, "creation_time": "2010-06-04T12:25:36Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49389, "attachment_id": null, "id": 137363, "time": "2010-06-04T12:34:57Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-06-04T12:34:57Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
