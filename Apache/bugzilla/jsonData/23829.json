The Imaging \nsupport of one of these is loaded and used at runtime based on availability.\n\nCurrently it supports simple operations such as Scale/ Resize, Rotate, Crop, \nGrayscale, TextOverlay, ImageOverlay and Border.\nMore operations such as Brightness, Blur, ShapeOverlay, etc will be added soon.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Abey, I realize six years is a very long time and I've read you are no longer maintaining your tasks and advice users to give the core-image task a try.\n\nAFAICT there are a few operations your tasks can perform that the core task can't (grayscale, overlay and crop - not sure about border).
