The requests are not given to index.php. If I enable the rewrite log there you can see, that the log in failed case ends earlier.\nNext what I have found is, that if I this rewrite put directly into apache httpd.conf into the virtualhost directive, it's working perfectly - so it's probably somehow connected with processing .htaccess.\nI was tring debian sid distribution, now I have upgraded to the lenny with 2.2.9-10+lenny6 apache2 package.\nI have for sure PHP versions 5.2.11, 5.2.12 and 5.3.1 and apache both in prefork and worker mode, still the same results.\n\nOndrej", "id": 134081, "time": "2010-01-31T13:12:12Z", "bug_id": 48646, "creation_time": "2010-01-31T13:12:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "There's no \"css\" in your rewritelog.
