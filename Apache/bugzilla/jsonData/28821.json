I have to split it into 2 steps of \"ant package\" and \"ant deploy\" \nto make themn work. \n\nTry \"The Coffee Break Application\" to reproduce the scenario:\nhttp://java.sun.com/webservices/docs/1.3/tutorial/doc/CB.html#wp64222\n\n\n2. Shutdown Tomcat under Win2K.\n\nI am not sure if it is the problem of JVM for Win32 or the problem of Tomcat. \nI accidently shutdown my Win2K laptop without stopping tbe Tomcat, then I \nopen my laptop again and try to bring up Tomcat, it would complaint some classes\nare missing and refuses to take off. I have to re-install it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28821, "attachment_id": null, "id": 57025, "time": "2004-05-08T14:04:12Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-05-08T14:04:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "1) I'm not going to install the web services pack, so please try to find deeper\nwhat the problem is, or contact Sun's support instead.
