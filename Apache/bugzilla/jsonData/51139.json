It seems the properties array, ALL_PROPERTIES, in DataSourceFactory does not contain validatorClassName so that property is never propogated?  When I add the property to the ALL_PROPERTIES array, it seems to work as I would expect.  Have I missed something in the expected configuration? I'll attach a patch for the proposed mod to DataSourceFactory.java.", "id": 146051, "time": "2011-05-01T03:08:56Z", "creator": "tkosacek@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-05-01T03:08:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51139, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed r1166619.", "id": 149110, "time": "2011-09-09T01:21:20Z", "creator": "kfujino@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-09-09T01:21:20Z", "is_private": false}]
