[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "racezhang@gmail.com", "text": "Dear JMeter developers,\n\nThe error messages dumped by JMeter (caused by configuration errors) are rather confusing in some cases. I strongly suggest to improve these error messages. Doing so would dramatically improve JMeter's usability.\n\nHere are two reproducible examples:\n\n1.\n\n//if I set the following invalid option value in jmeter.properties\njmeterengine.threadstop.wait=-1000\n\nJmeter simply dumps the error message:\n\nUncaught Exception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: timeout value is negative. See log file for details.\n\n(the above error message is really not informative. there is not much connection between \"timeout\" and the wrong option value \"threadstop.wait\". Further, the log file does not say anything too. This costs me extra debugging time for this simple mistakes. I would suggest to add show the *configuration name* or the *configuration value* in the error message)\n\n2.\n\nSimilar to the above error, if I set:\n\noro.patterncache.size=-1001\n\nJmeter dumps the error message:\n\nUncaught Exception java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError. See log file for details.\n\nThis is even less useful, and the log file does not show anything useful either.\n\nI would suggest to check the configuration option value when JMeter starts, and improve the corresponding error message (or logs).\n\nThanks\n\n\n-Sai", "id": 177194, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 56862, "creation_time": "2014-08-15T20:47:26Z", "time": "2014-08-15T20:47:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "racezhang@gmail.com", "text": "Another example:\n\n//set a wrong value to the following option in jmeter.properities\njmeter.save.saveservice.timestamp_format=HELLO  \n\n\nHere is the error message dumped by JMeter:\n\nAn error occurred: null\nerrorlevel=1\nPress any key to continue . . . \n\n\nI think that should be fixed too.", "id": 177195, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 56862, "creation_time": "2014-08-15T20:50:39Z", "time": "2014-08-15T20:50:39Z", "is_private": false}]
