In the manual is \nwritten that it has to be a cgi-script. I tried the Action command with a php-\nscript too and it worked too.\nNow I tried to use the same settings on the Apache 2.0.44 but it seems that it \nonly allows cgi-scripts! (I always get file not found errors else) Is this \nintentional? I mean it's very practical if the server also supported php-\nscripts to be used as handlers!!!!\nPlease let me know what you'r thinking about that case!!!", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 18335, "id": 33785, "time": "2003-03-25T19:53:51Z", "creator": "BSeifert@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2003-03-25T19:53:51Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18335, "is_private": false, "text": "\n  PHP as cgi, or the new PHP apache2 filter?  \n  Or the brand-new php apache2 handler?\n\n  It makes a difference; filters can only \"FILTER\" a real document.\n", "id": 34690, "time": "2003-04-08T07:01:34Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-08T07:01:34Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "PHP is used the following way:\n   LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache2.dll\n   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php\n\nNow I want to add the following statements into .htaccess for example:\n   Action handler /custom_handler.php\n   Sethandler handler\n\nIn Apache 1.3.xx all files in the directory where the .htaccess was placed were \nhandled by the php script custom_handler.php, but in Apache2 only cgi-scripts \nare allowed to be used as handler scripts.\nHow can I fix that problem or is there another way to configure a PHP handler?", "is_private": false, "id": 35029, "creator": "BSeifert@gmx.at", "time": "2003-04-11T20:31:43Z", "bug_id": 18335, "creation_time": "2003-04-11T20:31:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "text": "This was back when PHP was running as a filter, modern versions of PHP all use a\nnormal handler, and this should work.", "id": 75904, "time": "2005-06-03T02:52:34Z", "bug_id": 18335, "creation_time": "2005-06-03T02:52:34Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
