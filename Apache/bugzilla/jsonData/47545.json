Try to access a protected resource (http://localhost:port/test.html)\n2. The plugin with capture the request and see that custom cookie is not available, hence challenge the user for \n\ncredentials.\n3. User Submits the credentials and the plugin creates the custom cookie and set the same. (one can see the cookie \n\nusing httpheader/liveheader).\n4. Wait for the cookie expiration time (Cookie idle session time after which the cookie is not valid and user is \n\nchallenged again for credentials0 and the access the same resource . User will be challenged as the cookie gets \n\ntimeout and after user submits credentials  the plugin again set the custom cookie.\n5.After successful re authentication the user is accessed to view the requested resource , however the browser user \n\nthe local copy of the page( as it get 304 response).\n6. We could not see the \"custom Cookie\"  in browser in case if the resource is cached in browser (We are using \n\nMozilla), however if we clear the cache and re autheticate again we could see the \"Custom Cookie\".\n\nNote: The issue is not reproducible Internet Explorer.\n\nComponent version:\nOS: Windows 2000\nApache WebServer: 2.0.63\nBrowser; Mozilla", "id": 128936, "time": "2009-07-17T00:17:08Z", "creator": "contact2rajmishra@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-07-17T00:17:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "text": "What is the connection to httpd except that you are using it?\nThis is not a user support forum but for reporting bugs in httpd.", "id": 128938, "time": "2009-07-17T01:01:44Z", "bug_id": 47545, "creation_time": "2009-07-17T01:01:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
