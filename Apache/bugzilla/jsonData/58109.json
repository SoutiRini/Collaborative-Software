In TeamSite, there are previous versions of files that users can preview by clicking on a link.  The link opens a new window with a vpath to the file.\n\nThis used to work when we were using IIS, but when we moved to Apache 2.4 on Windows, the feature stopped working.\n\nAccording to HP, it's a bug in Apache issue where it is not able to read the folders with hash marks."}]
