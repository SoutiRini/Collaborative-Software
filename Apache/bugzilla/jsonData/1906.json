Both have incompatible jars called \"vcc.jar\"\nin their respective WEB-INF/lib directories.  I have identically\nnamed filters fetched from vcc.jar configured for ROOT and test.\nROOT is missing a dependency of a class used by its filter, and test's\nfilter version does not require that class to operate.  When I request\nany page in the /test hierarchy, it gives me a NoClassDefFoundError\nfor the class that is missing in the ROOT context, but should not be\nrequired for test.  Deleting vcc.jar from the ROOT context causes the\ncorrect vcc.jar to be loaded for test and test works fine.\n\nMy interpreation is that the class loader is pulling vcc.jar from the\nwrong webapp when there are two lying around.\n\nyak\n(replies to brad@vecna.com)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1906, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 2661, "time": "2001-05-25T14:36:03Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-05-25T14:36:03Z", "text": "Your interpretation isn't correct ;-)\nYou can find additional explanations in the comments of bug #1219.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 1219 ***"}]
