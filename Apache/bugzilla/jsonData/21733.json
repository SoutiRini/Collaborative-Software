The best one that I think is:\n\nTo specify somewhere in the program that if you get a connection trying to \naccess a directory of yours (clearly declared or using wildcards) then reject \nthe connection and don't write any line in the log file.\n\nThis would free bandwidth for productive connections\nThis wouldn't produce any line in the log file.\n\n\nThanks.
