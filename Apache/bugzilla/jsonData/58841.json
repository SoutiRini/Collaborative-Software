So far, I didn't understand how i could find the average response time from current metric. Only min max, but no way to calculate average. \n\nSo, I made this patch to send new metric to influxdb. \n\nI've made also a modification, to change the behaviour of the samplersList. I think it's better and more power to use a regex to select which sampler you want.", "id": 187566, "attachment_id": 33427, "creator": "mchassagneux@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-01-12T13:56:56Z", "time": "2016-01-12T13:56:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58841, "is_private": false, "id": 187738, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-01-16T09:09:46Z", "time": "2016-01-16T09:09:46Z", "text": "Hello,\nThanks for contribution.\nAvg metric has no real value in Load Testing so I don't think it should be added.\nRegarding the switch to regexp, it seems a good idea but introduces a backward incompatibility.\n\nWhat do other team members think ?\nRegards\nPhilippe"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "mchassagneux@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I'm working on a PTO team (Permit To Operate) and made dozen of test by week.
