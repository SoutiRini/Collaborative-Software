The cause is simple - the leader-pattern-width property is defined as\nhaving a percentage based of type LengthBase.CONTAINING_BOX. But in\nLengthBase.getBaseLength() the switch statement doesn't handle that case =>\nerror message.\n\nFor \"leader-pattern-width\" and \"leader-width\" the spec says: Percentages refer\nto the inline-progression-dimension of content-rectangle of parent area.\n\nSo I looked at the code and thought a statement like:\n    parentFO.getLayoutDimension(PercentBase.BLOCK_IPD).intValue();\nshould do the trick. But that is the code used in the case of percent base set\nto LengthBase.BLOCK_WIDTH. That means this should return the IPD of the\ncontaining block which may not be the same as the parent area as the parent area\ncould be an inline area.\n\nSo how do I get to the IPD of the parent area?\n\n", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "is_private": false, "id": 78258, "time": "2005-08-09T09:18:13Z", "bug_id": 36016, "creation_time": "2005-08-09T09:18:13Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36016, "attachment_id": null, "id": 78260, "time": "2005-08-09T09:52:11Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-08-09T09:52:11Z", "is_private": false, "text": "As I said earlier, the big deal with all the percentages is that the whole \nmechanism should be revised as is hinted at in the Wiki under \"FO Tree\":\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/FOPProjectTasks\n\nSee also a thread earlier this year:\nhttp://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110630668800003&r=1&w=2\n\nThe question you state is part of the problem.
