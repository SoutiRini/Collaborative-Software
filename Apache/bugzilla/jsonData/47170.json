Documentation is provided.\n\nImplementation of a \"ring buffer\" option to rotatelogs by Adrien Kunysz.\n\nThis comes handy when you have something very verbose that needs\nto run for a long time until it produces a specific event and you\nare only interested in what happened in the last ten minutes before\nthat event. Stracing of programs that fail \"randomly\" comes to mind.\nThis has been written after discovering the joys of tcpdump -C -W and\nfeeling the need for similar options in strace.\n\nThis applies against revision 773073 of httpd-2.2.x svn (although\noriginal version was developed against apache2_2.2.8-1ubuntu0.5 and\nthere have been very little changes required).", "id": 126875, "time": "2009-05-08T15:27:32Z", "bug_id": 47170, "creation_time": "2009-05-08T15:27:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 23629}]
