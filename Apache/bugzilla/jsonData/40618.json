I am not sure why this happens and that too\nrandomly.\n\nI tested the same program for a couple of months on a 32bit solaris server with\nJava 5 and it never crashed. But when i moved the application to 64bit AMD sun\nserver running redhat enterprise linux (ES release 4), the crashing appears\nrandomly (roughly 20-30 crashes a day with the program running every 5 minutes).\n\nHas anybody faced this issue ? Or any idea why is it happening and where the\nproblem lies.\n\nCheers,\nNavneet", "id": 94163, "time": "2006-09-27T14:38:24Z", "creator": "navneet.daga@dante.org.uk", "creation_time": "2006-09-27T14:38:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40618, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Any time the JVM crashes (when you aren't using native libraries) it's a bug in\nthe JVM.
