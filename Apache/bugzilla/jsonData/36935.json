So this is no bug, but actually a feature to handle your FO even\nthough automatic table layout is not yet available. Simply specify a width for\nyour table and the warning message goes away.

You specify the\nheight of either a table-cell or table-row which also sets the maximum to that\nvalue. Now, the contents of one of the cells is larger than your specified\nmaximum and therefore you get an error. The row will still automatically grow.\nThis is only a warning to you. Some users might want to have this reported as an\nerror in the future. Note that FOP Trunk is much more strict about the\ninterpretation of the specification. Therefore, it is likely that you'll get\nmore warning messages, but you have to make the difference between warnings and\nerrors.\n\nTo get rid of the warning message use block-progression-dimension.minimum\ninstead of height. That will leave the maximum on the value \"auto\" which allows\nthe row to grow as needed.\n\n> and\n> \n> 'Invalid ICC profile: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid ICC Profile Data\n> java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid ICC Profile Data'\n> \n> We actually don't know if *we* have done something wrong, or the *tool vendor*\n> or *fop*, so we need your help to clarifiy this.\n\nThat's not an error message from FOP.
