For example:\n\n    support.firePropertyChange(\"antiJARLocking\",\n                               new Boolean(oldAntiJARLocking),\n                               new Boolean(this.antiJARLocking));\n\nis instantiating Boolean objects when there is already a version of firePropertyChange that accepts boolean primitives.  So, the above can be rewritten to avoid instantiating new objects like:\n\n    support.firePropertyChange(\"antiJARLocking\",\n                               oldAntiJARLocking,\n                               this.antiJARLocking);\n\nThis pattern was repeated for numerous properties.\n\nI took the liberty of creating a patch.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 46822, "id": 125426, "time": "2009-03-08T22:56:01Z", "creator": "anthony@whitford.com", "creation_time": "2009-03-08T22:56:01Z", "attachment_id": 23358}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the patch.
