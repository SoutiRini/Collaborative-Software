Currently, PropertyConfigurator.doConfigure(URL...) does this, but PropertyConfigurator.doConfigure(String configFileName...) should do it as well, and DomConfigurator.doConfigure(String / URL) should do that also.\nSometimes setting the system property log4j.debug is very helpful to find out the location of configuration file that is actually taken. But currently it isn't since that important information is only logged in some circumstances.\nThanks so much!"}]
