However, this behavior is\nnot documented.\n\n\n(Not having such documentation is confusing and can waste time.  \n\nConsider trying to trace through class path definitions by adding a \nrecognizable but non-existent directory name and looking at a resulting \njavac command in verbose mode.  The added directory name won't show up, \nimplying that it wasn't added right or that the javac task isn't referring \nto the correct class path, even though that's not the case.\n\nIt can also be confusing in that you don't see the same class path entries\nas you see if you print out the class path (setting a property from the\nclass path and then echoing it).)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1523, "text": "fixed in nightly 2001-06-14", "id": 2920, "time": "2001-06-13T07:38:30Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-06-13T07:38:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
