I have checked some code\nand found a bug in creating an JNDIRealm. The signature of\ncreateJNDIRealm in MBeanFactory.java is not enough, it only has one\nparameter called parent, if we want to create an JNDIRealm through JMX,\nwe need another three parameters, they are\nConnectionURL,ConnectionName,ConnectionPassword.If we provide this\ninformation, the JNDIRealm can be initialized correctly,so you can set\nother attribute to the realm.\n   Attachments are the patches for admin webapp and the MBeanFactory\nmodification with tc5.5.x, I have tested it, and it can work now,\n  Another improvement is I add createJAASRealm in MBeanFactory for\ntomcat source code didn't contain creating JAASRealm JMX API,so I add\nit, it can work too.\n   \n  The above problem I haven't fire a bug in bugzilla, if it's necessary,\nI can do it.\n\n  Thanks.\n\nTerry Zhou", "count": 0, "id": 82724, "time": "2005-11-22T07:55:03Z", "bug_id": 37588, "creation_time": "2005-11-22T07:55:03Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37588, "text": "Created attachment 17011\nModify CreateJNDIRealm signature of  MBeanFactory and related admin webapp \n\nThis patch also include the admin webapp patch and new improvement of\nCreateJAASRealm method.", "id": 82725, "time": "2005-11-22T07:57:21Z", "creator": "xzhou@bea.com", "creation_time": "2005-11-22T07:57:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 17011}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "text": "build-main:\n    [javac] Compiling 150 source files to\nC:\\development\\tomcat\\tc5build\\tc5.5.x\\build\\build\\server\\webapps\\admin\\WEB-IN\nF\\classes\n    [javac]\nC:\\development\\tomcat\\tc5build\\tc5.5.x\\container\\webapps\\admin\\WEB-INF\\classes\\org\\apache\\webapp\\admin\\realm\n\\SaveJNDIRealmAction.java:173: cannot find symbol\n    [javac] symbol  : method getConnectionUserName()\n    [javac] location: class org.apache.webapp.admin.realm.JNDIRealmForm\n    [javac]                 values[2] = rform.getConnectionUserName();\n    [javac]                                  ^\n    [javac] Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.\n    [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.\n    [javac] Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.\n    [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.\n    [javac] 1 error\n\nBUILD FAILED\nC:\\development\\tomcat\\tc5build\\tc5.5.x\\build\\build.xml:799: The following error\noccurred while executing this line:\nC:\\development\\tomcat\\tc5build\\tc5.5.x\\build\\build.xml:384: The following error\noccurred while executing this line:\nC:\\development\\tomcat\\tc5build\\tc5.5.x\\container\\webapps\\admin\\build.xml:198:\nCompile failed; see the compiler error out\n", "count": 2, "id": 92794, "time": "2006-08-31T13:29:30Z", "bug_id": 37588, "creation_time": "2006-08-31T13:29:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37588, "text": "Created attachment 18781\nRevised patch.\n\nSorry for the build error of this patch, I have revised it and attached a new\npatch. \nWhen I wanted to write unit test for this patch, I couldn't find any jmx\nrelated test cases, at the same time I failed to run testcases in\ncontainer/tester directory, is there any instruction for that?", "id": 92850, "time": "2006-09-01T05:27:40Z", "creator": "xzhou@bea.com", "creation_time": "2006-09-01T05:27:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 18781}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 4, "id": 95603, "time": "2006-11-08T20:15:03Z", "bug_id": 37588, "creation_time": "2006-11-08T20:15:03Z", "text": "Many thanks for the patch.
