In particular, the granularity of\nwhat is ignored is important and is different for selectors,\nproperties, and property values.\n\nIH> -  the  SVG  Adobe  plugin puts a message into the message area of the\nIH> browser but happily goes on.

The Batik behavior is also, in fact, ok too (see the second\nlink below).\n\nIH> But are there rules here which I missed?\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/conform.html#conformance\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/conform.html#q3\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/syndata.html#parsing-errors\n\n-- \n Chris                            mailto:chris@w3.org\n\n==============================================================================\n\nChris,\n\nSorry,  I was indeed sloppy, I meant property (what mislead me is that\nAdobe displays a message saying 'bad selector'). And I was also sloppy\nin  another  respect: what Batik does is give an error message; if one\nsays   'ok',  then  it  would display the SVG file but it would ignore\nother, valid CSS rules in the included file.\n\nHaving  said  that,  I  do not understand why you say Batik is ok,\ntoo. The conformance section (thanks for the links) says:\n\n\"This  means that the user agent must accept all valid values and must\nignore declarations with invalid values.\"\n\nand clearly this is not what happens.\n\nIvan\n==============================================================================\n\nOn Sunday, June 30, 2002, 1:15:39 PM, Ivan wrote:\n\nIH> Chris,\n\nIH> Sorry,  I was indeed sloppy, I meant property (what mislead me is that\nIH> Adobe displays a message saying 'bad selector').\n\nOK, Adobe has a bad message there.\n\nIH> And I was also sloppy\nIH> in  another  respect: what Batik does is give an error message; if one\nIH> says   'ok',  then  it  would display the SVG file but it would ignore\nIH> other, valid CSS rules in the included file.\n\nWell, Batik should not ignore other rules that are valid.\n\nIH> Having  said  that,  I  do not understand why you say Batik is ok,\n\nbecause I did not know what you just said, that it then ignored the\nrest of the stylesheet.\n\nIH> too.
