With log4j-1.2.8 (i.e. in my previous log4j.xml file) I have a \ncategory declaration like the following:\n<category name=\"ClassName$Assigner\">\n        <priority value=\"debug\"/>\n</category>\nHere Assigner is an internal class name in a class called ClassName and this \ngets parsed ok.\nBut with log4j-1.2.13 (i.e in our new log4j.xml file) we want to use logger \ninstead of category and we have the following declaration:\n<logger name=\"ClassName$Assigner\">\n        <level value=\"debug\"/>\n</logger>\n \nThis gives error in parsing; it complains the following:\nlog4j:WARN Continuable parsing error 122 and column 43\nlog4j:WARN Attribute value \"ClassName$Assigner\" of type ID must be a name.\n\nThat is, it is not accepting ClassName$Assigner to be a logger name. \n\nwe wish to know where if there is any workaround possible for this internal \nclass to get parsed with a logger declaration. Is it a bug?\n\nRegards"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42575, "text": "Duplicate of 41487.
