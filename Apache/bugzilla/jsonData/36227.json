If\nI had a non-threadsafe controller available, I could put the reassign, confirm,\nand verify requests inside it and always get predictable results.\n\nI realize it would mean making other threads wait and could bottleneck a large\ntest, but I think if a controller like this is used responsibly (ie, to group\nvery small sets of atomic actions) it could be a great help.", "id": 78585, "time": "2005-08-17T16:23:10Z", "creator": "jmeter@binarytwo.com", "creation_time": "2005-08-17T16:23:10Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 111475, "time": "2007-12-05T17:28:08Z", "bug_id": 36227, "creation_time": "2007-12-05T17:28:08Z", "is_private": false, "text": "See also Bug 43384"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "This functionality could be addressed by bug 43384\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 43384 ***", "id": 126881, "time": "2009-05-08T17:54:39Z", "bug_id": 36227, "creation_time": "2009-05-08T17:54:39Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
