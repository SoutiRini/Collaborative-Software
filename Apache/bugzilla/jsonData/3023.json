[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3023, "text": "Encountered what appears to be a version dependency between Log4j and JUnit. \nThe documentation needs to be updated to indicate which specific version of \nJUnit must be used with Log4j.  I have discovered that combining Log4j v1.1.3 \nand JUnit 3.7 results in the following exception being thrown at runtime:  \njava.lang.LinkageError:  Class org/xml/sax/InputSource violates loader \nconstraints.  After spinning my wheels thinking there was something wrong with \nthe way I was using the XML configuration file, I finally figured out what that \nmessage REALLY meant, and restarted my application with the older JUnit 3.2 \nversion in the classpath.  When I did that, it worked.  The documentation needs \nto be updated to point out this dependency.  Though it mentions a JUnit \ndependency, it doesn't specify which release.", "id": 4333, "time": "2001-08-07T11:49:10Z", "creator": "rgrant@longaberger.com", "creation_time": "2001-08-07T11:49:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\nThis should be fixed in log4j 1.2.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 3023, "id": 14803, "time": "2002-04-25T22:16:41Z", "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-25T22:16:41Z", "attachment_id": null}]
