The actual showstopper is not\nthe  check for SSL_set_cert_store.  I was building on a Solaris 10 (SPARC)\nmachine.  My OpenSSL libraries (libssl.a and libcropto.a) was build previously\nusing an  embedded version of the compression library that came with the OpenSSL\npackage.  Unfortunately, it did not not have some of the functions checked by\nthe \"configure\" script.  After I rebuilt the OpenSSL package with the Zlib\npackage, everything went smoothly.", "id": 88818, "time": "2006-05-05T02:36:38Z", "creator": "wusasar@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-05-05T02:36:38Z", "attachment_id": null}]
