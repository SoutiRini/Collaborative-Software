The indexer extracts \ntext from the document and uses Lucene to index the text for optimized \nsearching.\n\nDASL Searches that use the contains clause are handled by \nTextContainsExpression and TextContainsExpressionFactory.\n\nThere are four extractors included for extracting text from the four most \npopular binary file formats.  With the exception of PowerPoint, I used \navailable libraries (MIT/BSD) to handle the actual extraction.  I used the \ntextmining library, a POI wrapper, to extract text from word(POI's Word \nlibrary doesn't strip the formatting tags).  I used the PDFBox library to \nextract text from PDF files.  I used the high level excel library in POI to \nextract text from excel, and I used POI's low level OLE library to extract \ntext from PowerPoint.\n\nI'm going to attach the jar's that are not already included with slide.  I'm \nalso attaching the file log4j.jar.  This is needed by PDFBox.  I don't \nunderstand why the log4j jar included with Slide doesn't work.  I just put \nboth in my WAR and it worked.", "id": 59991, "time": "2004-06-28T13:58:38Z", "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-28T13:58:38Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29842, "attachment_id": 11969, "text": "Created attachment 11969\nTextContentIndexer", "id": 59993, "time": "2004-06-28T14:27:34Z", "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:27:34Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29842, "attachment_id": 11970, "text": "Created attachment 11970\nTextContainsExpression", "id": 59994, "time": "2004-06-28T14:28:11Z", "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:28:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": 11971, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29842, "is_private": false, "count": 3, "id": 59995, "time": "2004-06-28T14:28:41Z", "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:28:41Z", "text": "Created attachment 11971\nTextContainsExpressionFactory"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 11972\nMSWordExtractor", "id": 59996, "time": "2004-06-28T14:29:07Z", "bug_id": 29842, "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:29:07Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 11972}, {"count": 5, "attachment_id": 11973, "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 11973\nMSExcelExtractor", "id": 59997, "time": "2004-06-28T14:29:29Z", "bug_id": 29842, "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:29:29Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29842, "attachment_id": 11974, "id": 59998, "time": "2004-06-28T14:29:51Z", "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:29:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 11974\nMSPowerPointExtractor"}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": 11975, "text": "Created attachment 11975\nPDFExtractor", "id": 59999, "time": "2004-06-28T14:30:10Z", "bug_id": 29842, "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:30:10Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 11976\nSample Domain.xml config", "is_private": false, "id": 60000, "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "time": "2004-06-28T14:30:40Z", "bug_id": 29842, "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:30:40Z", "attachment_id": 11976}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "creator": "ryanshaerhodes@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": 11977, "text": "Created attachment 11977\ntextmining library need by MSWordExtractor", "id": 60001, "time": "2004-06-28T14:31:17Z", "bug_id": 29842, "creation_time": "2004-06-28T14:31:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 10, "tags": [], "creator": "unico@hippo.nl", "is_private": false, "text": "I think this can be closed.
