Because the .war loses the dates, each new .war requires every file \nto download.  If the .war was properly decompressed, only the updated files \n(i.e. those with new build dates) would be downloaded because Java Web Start \nwould have access to the correct creation dates.\n\nthanks,\nanthony"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 27463, "time": "2002-12-05T13:29:35Z", "bug_id": 15081, "creation_time": "2002-12-05T13:29:35Z", "tags": [], "text": "We can't really do it, AFAIK.\nOTOH, you can use unpackWARs=\"false\" to get the real modification dates."}]
