The remote script could take some time, \nwhich is why waiting for \"ok\" with a timeout wasn't quite good enough.\n\nI've added code to TelnetTask which allows a new \"failon\" attribute for <read> \nelements. If the text in the attribute is read from the connection, the task \nfails. I use this to stop a build if deployment to a remote container fails.\n\nI'll attach the patch (cvs -q diff -u) after creating the bug.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 19077, "id": 35351, "time": "2003-04-16T16:21:31Z", "creator": "apache@eskimoman.net", "creation_time": "2003-04-16T16:21:31Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 5861\nPatch to add failon attribute to telnet's read task.", "is_private": false, "id": 35352, "creator": "apache@eskimoman.net", "time": "2003-04-16T16:22:16Z", "bug_id": 19077, "creation_time": "2003-04-16T16:22:16Z", "attachment_id": 5861}]
