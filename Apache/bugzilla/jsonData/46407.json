[{"count": 0, "text": "When specifying a script file in the BSF post-processor, the filename is treated as a code snippet instead of being loaded, taking precedence over the regular script.\n\nThis likely also affects the BSF Preprocessor, Assertion, and Listener, as they all call the BSFTestElement.processFileOrScript(BSFManager) method. The processFileOrScript method currently takes the filename and passes it directly to the script manager for evaluation instead of loading the file and passing its contents to the script manager.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n - Create new Test Plan\n - Add a new Thread Group\n - Add a new sampler (tested with a Debug Sampler)\n - Add a new BSF Postprocessor\n - Choose an available BSF language (Tested with \"javascript\")\n - Input valid javascript as filename (Tested with OUT.println(\"--- filename ---\"))\n - Input valid javascript as script (Tested with OUT.println(\"--- script ---\");)\n - Execute test\n\nExpected Results:\n - Postprocessor fails, unable to find file\n\nActual Results:\n - Console output: \"--- filename ---\"", "bug_id": 46407, "attachment_id": null, "id": 123346, "time": "2008-12-16T08:18:21Z", "creator": "NTmatter@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-12-16T08:18:21Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46407, "text": "Created attachment 23031\nTest case illustrating issue (watch the console output)", "id": 123347, "time": "2008-12-16T08:20:44Z", "creator": "NTmatter@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-12-16T08:20:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 23031}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "NTmatter@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 123348, "time": "2008-12-16T08:22:54Z", "bug_id": 46407, "creation_time": "2008-12-16T08:22:54Z", "text": "Affects nightly build from r724447"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46407, "attachment_id": null, "id": 123442, "time": "2008-12-19T19:55:44Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-12-19T19:55:44Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for the bug report.\n\nThe code for processing script files was completely broken - it did not bother reading the file - oops!\n\nFixed in SVN in r728228."}]
