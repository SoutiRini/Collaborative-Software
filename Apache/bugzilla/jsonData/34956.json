[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34956, "text": "Tomcat should enforce the requirements from servlet 2.4 specification SRV.8.2\n\nSRV.8.2 Using a Request Dispatcher\n\n\"To use a request dispatcher, a servlet calls either the include method or\nforward method of the RequestDispatcher interface. The parameters to these\nmethods can be either the request and response arguments that were passed in via\nthe service method of the Servlet interface, or instances of subclasses of the\nrequest and response wrapper classes that have been introduced for version 2.3\nof the specification. In the latter case, the wrapper instances must wrap the\nrequest or response objects that the container passed into the service method.\nThe Container Provider must ensure that the dispatch of the request to a target\nservlet occurs in the same thread of the same VM as the original request\"\n\nJustification:\n==============\nThe absense of this enforcement leads to software beeing developed not following\nthe specification. The software cannot be deployed later on a container which\nconforms to the above paragraph and hence must be changed before deployment.\nThis somehow contradicts the idea of having a standards based infrastructure.", "id": 75017, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "christian.buchegger@bea.com", "creation_time": "2005-05-18T14:47:47Z", "time": "2005-05-18T14:47:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34956, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 75701, "time": "2005-06-01T04:38:53Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2005-06-01T04:38:53Z", "text": "How does Tomcat not enforce this?

I'm not sure Tomcat is handling\na ServletRequestWrapper correctly.\n\nI gather the servlet spec says that users may wrap the\nrequest/response objects with their own implementation.\n\nTomcat's ApplicationDispatcher gets the request from\nthe outer request (the ServletRequestWrapper), trying to\nkeep track of the previous wrapper and current wrapper\n(or request) as it loops through to get the real request.\nWith a single wrapper, the value of \"previous\" is the\nsame as the original outer request. Then Tomcat calls...\n\n((ServletRequestWrapper) previous).setRequest(wrapper);\n\nwhich is the same as calling setRequest(wrapper) on the\nincoming request. Tomcat does not get and save the value\nof the original request URI. It calls setRequestURI(path)\non the wrapper, effectively changing the request URI of the\noriginal incoming request to the path of the forward.\n\nThen Tomcat sets the javax.servlet.forward.request_uri\nattribute by calling getRequestURI() from the original\nrequest... but that just got modified. Implying the\njavax.servlet.forward.request_uri attribute is going to\nget the value of the path for the forward.\n\nYou can test this on Tomcat by using a couple JSP to. Use\na HttpServletRequestWrapper in one JSP for the forward.\n\nFirst create \"result.jsp\" to display the desired request attribute...\n\n<%@ page language=\"java\" contentType=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\"%>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>RequestDispatcher Test</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <h1>Forward Request URI</h1>\n        javax.servlet.forward.request_uri =\n        <%= request.getAttribute(\"javax.servlet.forward.request_uri\") %>\n    </body>\n</html>\n\nCreate a JSP to forward without using a wrapper, \"forward.jsp\"...\n\n<%\n    javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher rd =\n        request.getRequestDispatcher(\"result.jsp\");\n    rd.forward(request, response);\n%>\n\nand a second forward using HttpServletRequestWrapper, \"wrapperforward.jsp\"...\n\n<%\n    HttpServletRequestWrapper wrapper = new HttpServletRequestWrapper(request);\n    javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher rd =\n        wrapper.getRequestDispatcher(\"result.jsp\");\n    rd.forward(wrapper, response);\n%>\n\nWhen you hit forward.jsp, the result page displays \"/some-context/forward.jsp\"\nfor the javax.servlet.forward.request_uri request attribute.\nHowever, hit wrapperforward.jsp and the result page displays\n\"/some-context/result.jsp\". From looking at the spec, I'd expect this \nshould be \"/some-context/wrapperforward.jsp\".\n\nI could probably create a patch for this specific case if you'd like.\nLet me know.", "id": 76147, "time": "2005-06-08T08:32:32Z", "bug_id": 34956, "creation_time": "2005-06-08T08:32:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Try to write less headache inducing comments in the future, as I didn't make it\nto the end.\n\nWhat I see is that: we wrap, we call wrequest.setRequestURI(requestURI) on *our*\nApplicationHttpRequest, and then after processing we discard that wrapper.
