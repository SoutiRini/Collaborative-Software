Any help is appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nVivek", "id": 135356, "time": "2010-03-15T15:29:19Z", "bug_id": 48900, "creation_time": "2010-03-15T15:29:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48900, "attachment_id": 25886, "text": "Created attachment 25886\nSVN patch to support sheet protection is XSSF and testcase for same\n\nAdded a protectSheet method to XSSFSheet also added the protectSheet method as part of the Sheet interface.", "id": 139093, "time": "2010-08-15T03:54:43Z", "creator": "brendan.nolan@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-08-15T03:54:43Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "is_private": false, "text": "Applied in r986649 with minor tweaks in unit tests.\n\nThanks,\nYegor", "id": 139197, "time": "2010-08-18T08:51:42Z", "bug_id": 48900, "creation_time": "2010-08-18T08:51:42Z", "attachment_id": null}]
