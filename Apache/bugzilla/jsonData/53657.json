If a characters metric information is missing, this value can be used from the Font Orienation section to act as a default. At present, FOP defaults to a space character which potentially leads to problems with wrapping under certain circumstances. This patch adds support for this as a fallback if its value is set. If it isn't set and the metric information is missing, it will fallback to FOPs existing method and use a space.\n\n[1] www.outputlinks.com/sites/AFP/ibm_foca_\u200bfocaref5.pdf"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 29168\nThis replaces the existing file as the patch checkbox was not enabled", "attachment_id": 29168, "bug_id": 53657, "id": 161109, "time": "2012-08-06T08:34:11Z", "creator": "rmeyer@hotmail.co.uk", "creation_time": "2012-08-06T08:34:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53657, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 161224, "time": "2012-08-10T09:52:23Z", "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-08-10T09:52:23Z", "text": "I made a few changes, if you could take a quick look over and say if you're unhappy with of my amendments, submitted in r1371629.
