Adding a second variable might also\nmake things a bit clearer, as you wouldn't have 'scheme' doing double\nduty both as a config container and as something that gets data from\nan external source.  One variable would contain the config options, or\nnull if there is none, the other would get filled in by the\nenvironment, and the logic to pick and choose from the variables would\nbe in the actual url constructor.\n\nSolution committed to CVS."}]
