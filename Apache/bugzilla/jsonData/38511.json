When \nsomebody send to the server a request like this: \n\n\"http://www.peopleconsulting.com.br/peopledb/some/inexistent/folder\", the \nsystem replies so:\n\n  \"Cannot locate servlet peopledb.some.inexistent.folder\"\n\n   where \"/peopledb\" is mapped to a customized filter servlet.\n\n   But if this guy (we cannot locate he, \u00b4cause he/she uses a obfuscated IP \naddress) send us a reques like this: \n\n\"http://www.peopleconsulting.com.br/peopledb/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x... very \nmuch others /x .../x/x/x/x\" causes the servere going down with a error message \n\nin the \"wraper.c\" file, and the system stops to work... We need to restart the \nserver, after that the system starts correctly again...\n\n   We don\u00b4t know more what to do!! There\u00b4s a fix to this problem?
