In our case, if interpcfg is called with a parameter that doesn't exactly match one of the table entries (it was numreq vs. numrequests for us), tcl may crash depending on what comes after the table in memory.\n\nI've attached a patch which fixes the two cases of this that I've found; there could well be others.", "id": 148606, "time": "2011-08-14T23:19:37Z", "bug_id": 51659, "creation_time": "2011-08-14T23:19:37Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 27386}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ronnie.brunner@netcetera.ch", "text": "Thanks Mark for the report and the patch.
