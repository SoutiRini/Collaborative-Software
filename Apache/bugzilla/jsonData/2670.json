You can \nsee the code it generates in \"Genrated HTML\".  Note that in the generated code \nthe <COMMENT>, <embed> and <noembed> tags are not well nested.  The \nintent of this, as I understand, it that Internet Explorer recognizes the \"object\" \ntag and uses it to define the plugin, and it recognizes the \"COMMNET\" tag \nwhich hides the \"embed\" and \"noembed\".   On the other had Netscape does not \nrecognize \"object\" or \"comment\" so it can see the \"embed\" which it uses to \ndefine the plugin.  This code is somwhat \"magical\" and works fine for Netscape \nand IE.  The problem is that it IS somewhat magical and thus it can break other \nbrowsers..
