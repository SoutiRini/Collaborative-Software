Basically the the attribute \"sslProtocol=TLS\"\" is omitted when saving it.\nAs a result, https connection doesn't work. If I add that attribute manually\nafter  I save the changes through the admin app, then https connection works.\n\nWe noticed a similar problem on tomcat 5.0.28 as well, and I posted a question\nabout this on the tomcat mailing lists last month. In tomcat 5.0.28, the issue\nwas slightly different that when you save changes through the admin webapp, the\nfollowing duplicate attributes to the HTTPS connector were being added. If we\nremove those entries manually, then the connector seem to come up fine."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35835, "attachment_id": null, "id": 77696, "time": "2005-07-27T02:11:17Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2005-07-27T02:11:17Z", "is_private": false, "text": "For the storeconfig module, this was fixed in 5.5.10: see\nhttp://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-tomcat-catalina/modules/storeconfig/src/share/org/apache/catalina/storeconfig/ConnectorStoreAppender.java?rev=1.3&view=log.\n Can you please test 5.5.10 and let us know?"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Well, when you get a chance to test, please let us know.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 35835, "id": 79309, "time": "2005-09-01T20:48:46Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2005-09-01T20:48:46Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35835, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Yes, I'd like to test it out.
