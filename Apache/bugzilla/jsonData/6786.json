[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6786, "text": "I have an application running on a Win2k machine using Tomcat.  It contains a \njsp page that displays several graphs of data using Batik 1.1.1.  The \napplication has been running for months (on 1.0 Batik) and I recently upgraded \nto the 1.1.1 version.  \n\nThe problem is that every so often I get the following error and one of the \nmany graphs will not be created:\n-------\nSVGRasterizer.writeImage(): General Error: org.w3c.dom.DOMException: An\nelement of type \"text\" has an invalid inline style: An error occurred\nwhile parsing the following style declaration: text-anchor:end;\nfont-family:Verdana; fill:black; font-size:9.0\n-------\nAgain it's only with one of the graphs and if I refresh the page, it usually \nwill display fine.  I would estimate that 1/25 times I receive a graph error, \nand keep in mind that that is drawing a dozen or so graphs each time. I'm not \neven certain the problem is due to the upgrade since it is so infrequent.\n\nI posted this to the Batik list and received the following response:\n------\nThat is a known threading problem. That occurs in this file:\nCSSOMStyleDeclaration.java\n\nAt these two lines:\nValueFactory f = factories.get(name.toLowerCase().intern());\nf.createCSSValue(value, CSSOMStyleDeclaration.this, imp);\n------\n\nHope that helps,\nTony", "id": 11345, "time": "2002-03-01T14:02:47Z", "creator": "ashawver@actaview.com", "creation_time": "2002-03-01T14:02:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "it's unclear if this is still a bug for the new CSS engine.\n", "tags": [], "bug_id": 6786, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 13014, "time": "2002-04-08T12:24:08Z", "creator": "tkormann@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-08T12:24:08Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "text": "Is this still a problem?", "bug_id": 6786, "attachment_id": null, "id": 44806, "time": "2003-09-28T23:47:00Z", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-09-28T23:47:00Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
