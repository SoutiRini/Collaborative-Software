And I do not know if DTLS is a protocol supported by tomcat native.

In the unlikely event of folks needing fixes for these issues it isn't that hard to build tc-native now that the build process has been fully documented on the wiki:\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/BuildTcNativeWin\n\nI am therefore minded to close this as WONTFIX, subject to a re-evaluation of that decision if we discover one or more of the 3 remaining issues are more likely that we thought to impact tc-native users.", "id": 180400, "time": "2015-01-19T20:45:32Z", "bug_id": 57465, "creation_time": "2015-01-19T20:45:32Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57465, "attachment_id": null, "id": 181926, "time": "2015-03-20T20:52:07Z", "creator": "michael.litwak@nuix.com", "creation_time": "2015-03-20T20:52:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I took a look at the steps for building tcnative-1.dll, at http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/BuildTcNativeWin, and found them to be beyond my skill level.\n\nI've asked the vendor of the application I use, Atlassian JIRA (for Windows) to build tcnative-1.dll for me, linked to the latest OpenSSL 1.0.1m and APR.
