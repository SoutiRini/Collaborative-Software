We are using Slide API for this purpose.\n\nWhen I try to get the list of resources from the WebDAV url,  It is missing some\nof the resource names from list. This is happening particularly when we tried to\nread Email objects which are having same subject(MS-Exchange uses email subject\nname for file storage).\n\nfor example:\n\nhttp://myserver/exchange/administrator/inbox is the base URL for Webdave\nresource, which contains three email files as resources with subject as\n'mysubject'. These emails files will be created with names subject.eml,\nsubject-1.eml, subject-2.eml\n\nWhen we query the server with the above URL, it is returning only one resource name.\n\nThis is happening with both webDavResourceFile.list(), webDavResourceFile.\n          listWebdavResources()\n\nBut when we captured XML responses through slide PropFind mehtod, it is\ncontaining all the resource names.\n\nSo please check the related methods and fix the problem.\n\nThanks,\nSudhakar.", "id": 57414, "time": "2004-05-14T13:48:17Z", "bug_id": 28980, "creation_time": "2004-05-14T13:48:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28980, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please don't make our lives hard and capture the traffic with a tool like tcpmon\nor similar and post it.\nIt would be really interesting to see, what Exchange is returning.", "id": 57417, "time": "2004-05-14T15:02:10Z", "creator": "ib@fiz-chemie.de", "creation_time": "2004-05-14T15:02:10Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "arh14@cornell.edu", "attachment_id": null, "text": "This bug may be related to #19669\n\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19669\n\nwhich has to do with how Slide parses the return names.
