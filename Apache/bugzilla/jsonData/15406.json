To my surprise, tomcat sends a 200 status code with the\ncontent, regardless of what the original error code is! As far as I can tell,\nthis is totally incorrect behavior. I regard it as a \"major\" bug because it's\nessentially \"censoring\" the http conversation between client and webapp, and\nmakes it impossible for search engines, et. al., to distinguish between good and\nbad urls.\n\nI have verified this behavior in jakarta-tomcat-4.0.6 and 4.1.12 in standalone\nmode. I have not tested it with any of the connectors. I am happy to help\ncontribute a patch if the developers agree this is a bug but have not the time\nto fix it."}, {"text": "Created attachment 4297\nhere is a patch against cvs head from 2002-12-30", "tags": [], "creator": "dball@rhoworld.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 28753, "time": "2002-12-30T16:16:53Z", "bug_id": 15406, "creation_time": "2002-12-30T16:16:53Z", "attachment_id": 4297}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15406, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 29419, "time": "2003-01-15T17:15:03Z", "creator": "dball@rhoworld.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-15T17:15:03Z", "text": "craig insists that the current behavior is correct, that it's the responsibility\nof the referred resource to set the response code."}]
