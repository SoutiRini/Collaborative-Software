Mine is same as attached, let me know if required.\n\nHi\n\nI have CentOS 6.5 hosting with Apache 2.2.x and PHP 5.6.x. Few weeks ago, I noticed a strange error on my server which was \"500 Internal Server Error\" with title code # 732 in browser's tab (please see attached). \n\nI searched for any possible solution of error on the Internet but nothing helped. Today surprised when noticed same error at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ (as you can see the attached screenshot).\n\nThe error has no logs, I checked all log files including access_log, error_log and domlogs also. Even I searched in suExec logs and all other possible log files but found nothing. \n\nPlease take a look at this error and suggest me appropriate solution. \n\nThanks", "id": 195210, "time": "2016-11-25T13:38:04Z", "creator": "manzoor.ahmed@midgr.com", "creation_time": "2016-11-25T13:38:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60420, "attachment_id": null, "id": 195212, "time": "2016-11-25T15:01:32Z", "creator": "manzoor.ahmed@midgr.com", "creation_time": "2016-11-25T15:01:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "any update on the issue?"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60420, "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to Manzoor Ahmed from comment #1)\n> any update on the issue?\n\nAfter 90 minutes?
