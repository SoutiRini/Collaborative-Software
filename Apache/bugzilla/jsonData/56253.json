A length check is needed for list() the same as for getResource().  Marking as major since this is needed for the Eclipse Tomcat \"Serve modules without publishing\" feature to work with Tomcat 8.\n\nThanks,\nLarry", "is_private": false, "id": 173784, "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "time": "2014-03-12T23:46:45Z", "bug_id": 56253, "creation_time": "2014-03-12T23:46:45Z", "attachment_id": 31384}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56253, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 173790, "time": "2014-03-13T10:43:45Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-03-13T10:43:45Z", "text": "Thanks for the report.
