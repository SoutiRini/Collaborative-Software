I have noticed that \nupon startup, the map program is started twice; once by the \"master\" process, \nand once by the child process that gets forked at the start.  I am using an \notherwise default httpd.conf.  This issue is minor in that the map program sits \nthere and never receives any STDIN input, but it is worrisome.  I have not yet \nhad a chance to try this on Linux to see if it is a cross-platform issue.\n\nQuestions: could it be because the \"init\" routine of mod_rewrite is being \ncalled in both processes?  Should something change here since the \"master\" \nprocess under Win32 is really just a process-forker and not a request handler?", "id": 71275, "time": "2005-02-20T14:20:44Z", "bug_id": 33660, "creation_time": "2005-02-20T14:20:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "Yes, this is caused by the behavoir of the winnt MPM.
