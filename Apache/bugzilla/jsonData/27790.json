One of the recent changes to Http11Protocol.java \nadded pause() and resume() methods which call log.info() to record the actions. \nHowever, the corresponding messages were not placed in LocalStrings.properties, \nso errors occur when attempting to fetch the text. Under JDK 1.4, using the \njava.util.logging.Logger class, a message is printed, and no exception is \nthrown for the missing text. However, under 1.3, using the commons SimpleLog \nclass, an exception is thrown, which kills the main thread, resulting in the \nhang.\n\nI've added the following to the properties file:\n\nhttp11protocol.endpoint.pauseerror=Error pausing endpoint\nhttp11protocol.pause=Pausing Coyote HTTP/1.1 on port {0}\nhttp11protocol.endpoint.resumeerror=Error resuming endpoint\nhttp11protocol.resume=Resuming Coyote HTTP/1.1 on port {0}\n\nI suspect that there may be other missing message strings, since the \nLifeCycleException seems to be complaining about a similar problem.
