(all the properties have to be NOT set to \nexecute)\n\n- The change would be backward compatible except if the properties include a \ncomma which seems quite unlikely.\n- This allows the code to be much simpler not needing to use the condition task\n- comma separated values are usable in many other tasks"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37726, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 2584 ***", "id": 83061, "time": "2005-12-01T06:54:23Z", "creator": "jan@materne.de", "creation_time": "2005-12-01T06:54:23Z", "is_private": false}]
