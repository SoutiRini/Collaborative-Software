[{"text": "Hi,\n\nusing Apache 2.2.3 with Win2000Pro,\nwhen I turn on Win32DisableAcceptEx to avoid AcceptEx problems, then\nhttpd.exe consumes a lot of memory - 300MB and more. It grows after each http\nrequest.\nAt first I thought that I could be some PHP memory issue,\nbut I tested it with only static pages. After each request\nmemory of httpd.exe increases about 5 MB more...\n\nWhen Win32DisableAcceptEx is commented by #, memory of the httpd.exe is\nconstantly about 20MB.\n\nThis problem was discussed also down here:\nhttp://www.apachelounge.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5920\n\nFor windows users it is ugly trap:\n-use Win32DisableAcceptEx - memory problems\n-don't use Win32DisableAcceptEx - connections problems\n\nI found by google, that this problem occured on newer and later Apache versions\ntoo.... (with Win2000, WinXP, Win2003 server)\n\nSome fix or good advice would be great.\n\nTom", "tags": [], "bug_id": 42894, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 105418, "time": "2007-07-13T18:13:40Z", "creator": "idvis@seznam.cz", "creation_time": "2007-07-13T18:13:40Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 32750 ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 106345, "creator": "davi@apache.org", "time": "2007-08-04T12:42:45Z", "bug_id": 42894, "creation_time": "2007-08-04T12:42:45Z", "is_private": false}]
