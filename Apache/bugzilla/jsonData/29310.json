That's useful for us, for example, since globally Indexes are\ndisabled, but if someone wishes to, he can enable Indexes for his web page (and\nsubdirectories) or whatever, while we don't want to let people change other options.\n\nThis patch might not be fully complete or up to the Apache conventions, but I\ntried to write it as clean as possible given the time I have.  Please tell me if\nthere are problems with it.  In the patch there is also very short documentation\nfor this option.\n\nI only tested, with version 2.0.49, on FreeBSD 4.9, that without that option the\ndefault (previous) behaviour is still used (All), and that specifying it has the\ndesired effect of only allowing those options to be overridden.  Perhaps there\nare other things to test with it.\n\nI'd be glad to have this patch (or a variant of it) integrated, to save us from\nfurther patching of new versions, and so it might be useful to others as well."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "alsbergt-apache@cs.huji.ac.il", "attachment_id": null, "id": 58428, "time": "2004-05-31T15:31:23Z", "bug_id": 29310, "creation_time": "2004-05-31T15:31:23Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The URL was bad, I fixed it now.\n"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "alsbergt-apache@cs.huji.ac.il", "attachment_id": 11721, "id": 58523, "time": "2004-06-02T07:14:12Z", "bug_id": 29310, "creation_time": "2004-06-02T07:14:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 11721\nPatch to add AllowOverrideOpts directive"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "attachment_id": 11722, "is_private": false, "id": 58524, "time": "2004-06-02T07:27:48Z", "bug_id": 29310, "creation_time": "2004-06-02T07:27:48Z", "text": "Created attachment 11722\nAdds AllowOverrideOpts against 2.1-CVS"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "+1 - Tested w/ the patch for 2.1 and a cursory code review.\n\nOnly issue I see is the naming of the directive.
