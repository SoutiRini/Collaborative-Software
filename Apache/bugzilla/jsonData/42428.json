I can save the WorkBench as\nits own \".jmx\" file and then merge that into my Test Plan, but when I save my\nTest Plan again the merge that I made ceases to exist.\n\nThis is rather annoying since I have set up a HTTP Proxy Server that has a long\nlist of includes and excludes which takes a lot of effort to setup due to the\nusability (or lack of) of the includes and excludes UI.\n\nIm not sure whether this is by design or a bug, but seems to be a bug. As I see\nit JMeter loads one Test Plan at a time. Hence that workbench should be\nassociated with one Test Plan since all Test Plans are going to be inherently\ndifferent hence what works for one Test Plan in the workbench may not work for\nanother. If the argument above does not settle well on the palate then the\nworkbench should be global and saved as part of each users application settings.\nOr an HTTP Proxy Server should be able to be under a Test Plan.\n\nNOTE: Using Sun's JRE 1.6.0_01"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42428, "attachment_id": null, "id": 103242, "time": "2007-05-15T13:19:01Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-05-15T13:19:01Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Currently, this is by design.\n\nChanging to enhancement."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Is this useful now with Test Fragment ?", "attachment_id": null, "id": 150445, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2011-10-10T21:09:11Z", "bug_id": 42428, "creation_time": "2011-10-10T21:09:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42428, "attachment_id": 30142, "id": 166356, "time": "2013-04-03T13:13:58Z", "creator": "dzmitry.kashlach@blazemeter.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-03T13:13:58Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 30142\nsaving WorkBench to JMX\n\n  Hi,\n\n  Please, review my patch for this bug.
