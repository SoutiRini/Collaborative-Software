Therefore, any \"*.cfm\" file must be proxied to the alternate server.  \nAlthough this is not a good example of code :-), this is just to illustrate \nthe process:\n\n     ProxyRequests Off\n     ProxyVia On\n     <Proxy *>\n             Order deny,allow\n             Allow from all\n     </Proxy>\n     ReWriteEngine on\n     RewriteRule (.*)\\.cfm$ /cfm/$1.cfm [P]\n     ProxyPass /cfm http://appserver.exampledomain.org \n     ProxyPassReverse /cfm http://appserver.exampledomain.org \n\nThis configuration works just fine as long as the URL is complete.  \ni.e., \"/directory/index.cfm\".\n\nHowever, if mod_dir must extract a match from DirectoryIndex (e.g., a URL \nof \"/directory\" or \"/directory/\" where the match in the directory is \nindex.cfm, the proxy is not applied and Apache attempts to \nload \"/directory/index.cfm\" from the local server instead.\n\nIn the above referenced closed bug, this apparently was to be fixed by \nrestoring mod_dir to its original behavior.  However, we are still \nencountering the same issue with 2.0.52.\n\nI have raised this question on the user list and another list without a \nsuccessful response, so as much as I really didn't want to, drafting a bug on \nit in hopes that there is a resolution to this.  This one is unfortunately a \nshow-stopper for us (without explicitly rewriting a lot of hardcoded URLS).\n\nAppreciate any insight...", "id": 70578, "time": "2005-02-07T16:36:11Z", "creator": "rgranvin@iglide.net", "creation_time": "2005-02-07T16:36:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33425, "text": "This behavior remains unchanged in the just released 2.0.53 version.", "id": 70854, "time": "2005-02-11T20:08:13Z", "creator": "rgranvin@iglide.net", "creation_time": "2005-02-11T20:08:13Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "rgranvin@iglide.net", "is_private": false, "text": "Andre offered this patch as a fix for the problem and will try to install it \ninto the next version?\n\n--- modules/http/http_request.c (revision 153801)\n+++ modules/http/http_request.c (working copy)\n@@ -404,6 +404,7 @@\n      * rr->pool.\n      */\n     apr_pool_join(r->pool, rr->pool);\n+    r->proxyreq = rr->proxyreq;\n     r->mtime = rr->mtime;\n     r->uri = rr->uri;\n     r->filename = rr->filename;\n", "id": 71003, "time": "2005-02-15T16:22:07Z", "bug_id": 33425, "creation_time": "2005-02-15T16:22:07Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "is_private": false, "text": "It's already in 2.1 (for over a year) and I've proposed it for backport.\nFunnily, the one, who put it into 2.1, was /me ;-)", "id": 71010, "time": "2005-02-15T17:19:15Z", "bug_id": 33425, "creation_time": "2005-02-15T17:19:15Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33425, "text": "(In reply to comment #3)\n> It's already in 2.1 (for over a year) and I've proposed it for backport.\n> Funnily, the one, who put it into 2.1, was /me ;-)\n\nSo can we assume it's now fixed?", "count": 4, "id": 105971, "time": "2007-07-26T11:32:12Z", "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-26T11:32:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33425, "text": "As far as I know...
