Additionally, all the modified source lines contain DOS-style EOL characters. \n \n I strongly suggest reverting this patch before releasing 4.1.16. As a temporary \nworkaround, you can have the connector listen on any address by adding \naddress=\"0.0.0.0\" in the configuration: \n \n  <Connector className=\"org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector\" \n                        address=\"0.0.0.0\" port=\"8009\" minProcessors=\"5\" \nmaxProcessors=\"75\" \n                        enableLookups=\"false\" redirectPort=\"8443\" \n                        acceptCount=\"10\" debug=\"0\" connectionTimeout=\"0\" \n                        useURIValidationHack=\"false\" \n                        protocolHandlerClassName=\"org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler\"/>"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 27646, "time": "2002-12-11T07:38:20Z", "bug_id": 15258, "creation_time": "2002-12-11T07:38:20Z", "is_private": false, "text": "EOLs are not fixed, but AJP will again bind all addresses by default."}]
