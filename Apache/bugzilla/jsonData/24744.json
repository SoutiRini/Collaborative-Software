When \ndoEndTag() is invoked for the second tag, the tag still holds the reference to \nthe same BodyContent which still contains the contents \"text here\" (i.e. it is \nnot cleared).  There is no other way to detect this situation as to set a \nflag \"hasBody\" in doStartTag() to false and set it to true in doInitBody().  Is \nthis desired behavior or is it a bug?\n\nNote: This might be related to #17509.", "id": 47488, "time": "2003-11-17T10:22:50Z", "creator": "bob.news@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2003-11-17T10:22:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24744, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 16830 ***", "id": 54223, "time": "2004-03-18T15:31:08Z", "creator": "issa.gorissen@axa.be", "creation_time": "2004-03-18T15:31:08Z", "is_private": false}]
