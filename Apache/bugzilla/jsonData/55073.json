I\nattached a two-line patch that fixes it.\n\nIn method \"ValidateVisitor.isExpression\", the loop over \"nodes\" should\nbreak immediately after \"elExpression\" is set to \"true\".  All the\niterations after \"elExpression\" is set to \"true\" do not perform any\nuseful work, at best they just set \"elExpression\" again to \"true\".\n\nMethod \"startInternal\" in class \"StandardHost\" has a similar loop\n(over \"valves\"), and this loop breaks immediately after \"found\" is set\nto \"true\", just like in the proposed patch.  Other methods (e.g.,\n\"MapperListener.findDefaultHost\", \"CollectVisitor.checkSeen\",\n\"JspDocumentParser.processChars\", \"ParameterParser.isOneOf\") also have\nsimilar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed patch.", "id": 167715, "time": "2013-06-07T14:23:24Z", "bug_id": 55073, "creation_time": "2013-06-07T14:23:24Z", "attachment_id": 30404}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55073, "text": "Thanks for the patch.
