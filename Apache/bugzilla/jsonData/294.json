After pressing the submit button, the browser either reports that the page was not accessible, hangs, or not all of the data gets uploaded properly.\r\n\r\nIn debugging from the JSP side of things, the .jsp page will sometimes be invoked and sometimes it will not be invoked.  If it is invoked, readLine() on the stream returned from request.getInputStream() will not read all of the data posted.  I can actually call readLine() after it returns -1 and get more data, but some of the data is still missing.\r\n\r\nI have narrowed this down to the communication between mod_jk and tomcat using the ajp13 protocol.  If I reconfigure mod_jk to use the ajp12 protocol, there is no problem.  If I communicate to tomcat directly through port 8080, there is no problem.\r\n\r\nI have also reproduced this problem under Linux, RedHat 6.1.\r\n\r\nI need to use the ajp13 protocol because my application must use Apache SSL and the ajp12 protocol does not support passing the correct information to tomcat for SSL.\r\n", "id": 271, "time": "2000-12-06T13:12:22Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2000-12-06T13:12:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nacho@apache.org", "text": "Fixed in Tomcat 3.3\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 526 ***", "id": 2183, "time": "2001-04-30T16:57:46Z", "bug_id": 294, "creation_time": "2001-04-30T16:57:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
