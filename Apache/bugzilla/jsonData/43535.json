Did you\nforget to set the Content-Length Header with this sampler?\n\nI tried setting the message content with the input field in the gui as well as\nusing a file on the hard disc but both ways don't work. I set the SOAPAction\nfield activated, but as far as I can see if it is not set, the error is the same.\n\nAdditionally the request data field in the tree listener looks kind of weird. No\nHTTP method set in front of the url ... no body set ... I don't know what I\ncould have done wrong, because its not that hard to configure that Sampler ...\n\nRegards"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Try JMeter 2.3; this has a lot of fixes compared with 2.2.\n\nDoes it work in 2.3?", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 43535, "id": 108891, "time": "2007-10-02T05:57:36Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-10-02T05:57:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 108896, "time": "2007-10-02T06:30:16Z", "bug_id": 43535, "creation_time": "2007-10-02T06:30:16Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 43536 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43535, "text": "I tried 2.3 meanwhile and it works in this version.
