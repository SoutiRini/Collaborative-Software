[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "First off, greetings.  And thanks for rocking the house with Apache 2.  This \nbug report is for Apache 2.0.52, but that wasn't an option in the Bugzilla \nthinger, so I put 2.0.51, instead.\n\nThis bug concerns my first installation of Apache 2, which took place about \ntwo hours ago.\n\nIn the configuration file, I removed all the default server options.  That is, \nI took out all the ServerAdmin, DocumentRoot, ServerName, <Directory>, etc. \ndirectives that may have had anything to say about where the server looks when \nit receives a request for a page.\n\nI did leave the Listen directive, but I changed it to Listen 5999, since I'm \nstill using Apache 1.3 on port 80.  (This bug concerns this change.)\n\nThen, I added two virtual hosts at the bottom of the file.  The first host is \nstrontium.denterprises.org, and the second is hydrogen.denterprises.org.\n\nWhen I go to strontium:5999 and force an error, it shows:\nApache/2.0.52 (Unix) Server at strontium.denterprises.org Port 5999\n... which is correct.\n\nWhen I go to hydrogen:5999 and force an error, it shows:\nApache/2.0.52 (Unix) Server at hydrogen.denterprises.org Port 80\n... which is incorrect.\n\nThe hydrogen:5999 should not show that it's running on port 80.\n\nIf you want me to duplicate this in some other fashion, please let me know.  I \ndon't think I'll be going live with 2.0.52 for another several days.\n\nColin", "is_private": false, "id": 64816, "creator": "cww@denterprises.org", "time": "2004-10-08T10:20:08Z", "bug_id": 31599, "creation_time": "2004-10-08T10:20:08Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31599, "attachment_id": 12995, "is_private": false, "id": 64817, "time": "2004-10-08T10:26:06Z", "creator": "cww@denterprises.org", "creation_time": "2004-10-08T10:26:06Z", "text": "Created attachment 12995\nVirtualHost bit of httpd.conf"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "The Servername directive needs to get the port in 2.x (see the upgrading docs).", "is_private": false, "id": 64818, "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "time": "2004-10-08T10:30:22Z", "bug_id": 31599, "creation_time": "2004-10-08T10:30:22Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31599, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 64821, "time": "2004-10-08T11:45:58Z", "creator": "cww@denterprises.org", "creation_time": "2004-10-08T11:45:58Z", "text": "I changed the ServerName for the second VirtualHost to \nhydrogen.denterprises.org:5999, and everything works fine.\n\nDon't you think it shouldn't be like this, though?
