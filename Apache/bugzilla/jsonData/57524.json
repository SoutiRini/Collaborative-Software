The size of char is assumed to be 8 bits, and char is assumed to be unsigned. When these two assumptions aren't met, bad things happen; in the worst case, I got the wrong opcode and payload length because of sign extending.\n\nThe attached patch corrects the bit operations. As a bonus, it also comments another (unrelated) assumption the implementation makes - something to be fixed later."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "christophe.jaillet@wanadoo.fr", "text": "Another patch has been applied to trunk (r1657261) and backported to 2.4.x (r1664118).
