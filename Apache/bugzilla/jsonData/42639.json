Each server instance has a config \nfile having more than 500 rewrites in it. We're planning to bring in 2 more \nservers to the cluster to share the load and with the number of servers going \nup in count, we find it extermely cumbersome to make changes to rewrites and \ndistribute the same across servers. My suggestion would be that is it possible \nto put all rewrites in one common file and call that file from the config file \nof each server? I'd appreciate if you could help me find a solution.\n\nThanks in advance."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This is indeed possible if the servers are sharing a filesystem simply using the\nInclude directive.
