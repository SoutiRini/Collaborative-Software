This time the approach is quite simple but seems effective.  I have had to make only a single change to Ant's core to simplify the implementation of this task.  This was to modify RuntimeConfigurable such that when it sets a Project reference declared by the id attribute, the actual value set will be the proxy object of a TypeAdapter when the wrapped element is a TypeAdapter AND its proxy is an instance of ProjectComponent.  Ant developers, please take a look at this approach and see what you think about it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48798, "attachment_id": null, "text": "To elaborate further on the reason for the alteration to RuntimeConfigurable, this change allows the id attribute to be used on the AugmentReference task, leaving all other attributes free to be manipulated on the augmented reference.", "id": 134787, "time": "2010-02-22T19:26:37Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-02-22T19:26:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 48798, "is_private": false, "id": 134881, "time": "2010-02-25T05:18:40Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-02-25T05:18:40Z", "tags": [], "text": "A diff would have been helpful ;-)\n\nSounds fine to me."}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": 25059, "bug_id": 48798, "is_private": false, "id": 134887, "time": "2010-02-25T15:34:46Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-02-25T15:34:46Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 25059\npatch against trunk\n\nWTF, I thought I'd added the patch... please reconsider your \"sounds fine\" after reviewing for controversy.  ;)"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "text": "with latest bugfixes to RuntimeConfigurable it is possible to implement this task completely independently; committed modified task svn r936382", "id": 136292, "time": "2010-04-21T13:39:30Z", "bug_id": 48798, "creation_time": "2010-04-21T13:39:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
