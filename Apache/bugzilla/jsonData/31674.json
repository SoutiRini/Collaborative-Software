(although I don't see\nthat attach option at the moment...)\n\nI added code to add a logger, and changed the margins a bit.  I really did not\nintend to include these changes in the patch, but I did not feel confident\nenough to rip them out with out re-testing everything.  I thought a savvy\ndeveloper could weed though the mistake and grab the important Printer and Tray\ncode.\n\nI also added an option to not exit when the task is completed.  This made it\neasier for me to call the FOP Java classes from my Java code.\n\nFinally I ended up using environment variables for my options.  I really don't\nthink this is a good idea, but I did not have the time to add real parameter\noptions to the fop code.\n\nAny way, I realize this may be too sloppy to use, and I apologize.  I figured I\nshould offer it any way, since I may not be the only developer interested in\nselecting a printer and tray to print to. (I really hope to offer a cleaner\nversion of this in the future, if it's something FOP is interested in.)\n\nThanks alot,\nAndy."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31674, "attachment_id": 13046, "id": 65000, "time": "2004-10-12T18:08:13Z", "creator": "agaleano@poss.com", "creation_time": "2004-10-12T18:08:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 13046\n[PATCH] allowing printer and tray selection, although needs trimmed of extra code."}]
