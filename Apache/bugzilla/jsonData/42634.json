Your description suggests that Apache log4j \nworks as expected and nlog4j doesn't.  If you have a bug report against nlog4j, you should file it with \nits maintainer (http://www.slf4j.org/nlog4j/)\n\nThere was a recent discussion on log4j-user on Object Renderers (http://marc.info/?\nt=118064700000001&r=1&w=2).  ObjectRenderers were intended to provide custom conversion of \nnon-String messages to strings.  log4j allows you to pass any Object as a message parameter, if the \nmessage is a string (by far the most common), no conversion is performed, otherwise the repository is \nchecked for a matching renderer or if non Object.toString() is called.\n\nIf you are passing String objects as message parameters and want to do some manipulation of the \ncontent before output, then you should be investigating a custom Layout."}]
