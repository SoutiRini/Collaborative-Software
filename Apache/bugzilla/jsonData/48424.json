I applied a variation of it to trunk. The changes I made were:\n - replaced \"sb.append(A + B);\" with \"sb.append(A); sb.append(B);\"\n - re-ordered the code to make it clearer that the code was the same\n\nIt does seem odd that this code is duplicated but I haven't had a chance to look into it. If you want to look into the duplication feel free to open another bug and attach a patch.\n\nThanks again.", "id": 133350, "time": "2010-01-05T11:56:55Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-01-05T11:56:55Z", "is_private": false}]
