If this \nController has a child that matches the name (defined as \u201ecase value\u201c), this \nsubelement will be run. If there is no match, JMeter runs the element with the \nname \u201eDefault\u201c (not case-sensitive). If no default element exists, JMeter skips \nthe Case Controller. \n\ne.g.: Variable ${test} exists with value \"de\"\n\n+ CaseController with CaseValue=${test}\n    + SimpleController called \"de\"\n       + Request1\n       + Request2 \n    + SimpleController called \"fr\"\n       + Request3\n       + Request4\n\nas the value of ${test} is \"de\", the casecontroller runs the simplecontroller \nwith the name \"de\". without casecontroller, we would have to use two \nifcontrollers.\n\ncheers,\n   chris"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43379, "attachment_id": 20811, "id": 108121, "time": "2007-09-13T04:37:20Z", "creator": "christoph.schragen@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2007-09-13T04:37:20Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 20811\ncasecontroller\n\nPatch for CaseController implementation"}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 43379, "is_private": false, "id": 111465, "time": "2007-12-05T14:37:31Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-12-05T14:37:31Z", "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the patch - a neat idea.\n\nHowever, rather than create a new test element, I've extended the existing \nSwitch Controller.\n\nIf the entry is not numeric, then it chooses the named child, as per the patch.\n\nCode is in SVN r601554"}]
