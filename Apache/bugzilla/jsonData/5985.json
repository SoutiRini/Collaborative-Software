Watchdog was guilty of this at one\npoint.  The TLD lists references to a class associated with a particular tag.\nIf a particlar referenced class doesn't exist in the application, Tomcat will\nstill deploy, however, other implementations flag this as an error and will not\ndeploy the app."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5985, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 142657, "time": "2010-12-13T14:43:16Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-12-13T14:43:16Z", "text": "There were some initial issues with this feature due to bugs in the XML validation that shipped with the JVM.\n\nIt should work in 5.5.x and 6.0.x although configuration is not per Context.\n\nIn 7.0.x all the validation settings have been moved to the Context and I run with validation enabled by default. A few small errors can trigger a lot of stack traces but that (and the associated slowdown on XNL parsing) is the only niggle I have observed."}]
