While the jar files associated with the taglibs \nto be shared can be \"shared\" in <tomcat>/shared/lib, the TLD mappings \nmust be defined within the web.xml of every web application that wants \nto use that shared library.\n(defining the TLD mappings in <tomcat>/conf/web.xml does not currently\nwork because Jasper only processes TLD mappings in the web.xml of the \nwebapp)\n\nJSP 1.2 has simplified the use of tag libraries by supporting the\nauto discory of TLD mappings in jar files. One simply has to \ndrop the tag-library's jar file at the proper location, and voila... the\ncontainer will process any TLD contained in these jar files and record \nthe proper mappings.\n\nIt would really be nice if it were possible to do the same at the\ncontainer (Tomcat) level.\n\nAs suggested by Craig, this could be supported in the following way:\n\nExtend the \"search for TLDs inside a JAR file\" algorithm to work its\nway up the parent class loaders as well.  That way, one can simply\ndrop the jar files of tag libraries to be shared into <tomcat>/common/lib \nand they would be recognized without requiring any TLD mappings in \nany web.xml."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15875, "text": "Fixed in Tomcat 5.\n", "id": 33857, "time": "2003-03-26T19:37:17Z", "creator": "jan.luehe@sun.com", "creation_time": "2003-03-26T19:37:17Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
