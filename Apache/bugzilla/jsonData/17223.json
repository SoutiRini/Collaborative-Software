When tomcat is \nstarted it starts ok but after that it continuously keeps throwing the \nfollowing exception.\nStarting service Tomcat-Standalone\nApache Tomcat/4.1.18\nStarting service Tomcat-Apache\nApache Tomcat/4.1.18\njava.io.EOFException\n        at java.io.ObjectInputStream$BlockDataInputStream.peekByte(ObjectInputSt\nream.java:2438)\n        at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject0(ObjectInputStream.java:1245)\n        at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject(ObjectInputStream.java:324)\n        at org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession.readObject(StandardSessio\nn.java:1337)\n        at org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession.readObjectData(StandardSe\nssion.java:852)\n        at org.apache.catalina.session.FileStore.load(FileStore.java:337)\n        at org.apache.catalina.session.StoreBase.processExpires(StoreBase.java:3\n07)\n        at org.apache.catalina.session.StoreBase.run(StoreBase.java:368)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:536)\n\nAlthough the initial work around for this was to reinstall tomcat but this \nproblem surfaces after 2 or 3 days of reinstall. Although this did not stop us \nfrom devlopment but recently the application has started loosing session \ninformation as well, which is a big show stopper as every few minutes we have \nto restart the computer to fix the problem but it starts shortly after we start \nour testing. The same piece of code if run on another computer with identical \nsetup the application seems to work fine. There seems to be a memory leak \nsomewhere because of which tomcat looses the session info. If anyone can please \nguide me on how to solving this problem. Thanks in advance.\n\nRohit.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 17223, "id": 31635, "time": "2003-02-19T21:54:25Z", "creator": "allforgals@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-02-19T21:54:25Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 17223, "text": "This is most likely a configuration problem.
