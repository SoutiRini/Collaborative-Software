All other modules are adding only lowercase values to this header. It would be appreciated if mod_deflate could do the same. For consistencies sake.\n\nFor example, using mod_negotiate with transparent content negotiation for language and format and mod_deflate, a Vary header may look like this:\nVary: negotiate,accept,accept-language,Accept-Encoding\n\nNot really a bug or a problem, but \u2026 for consistency\u2019s sake and it is probably really easy to fix.", "id": 114611, "time": "2008-03-13T14:58:31Z", "bug_id": 44601, "creation_time": "2008-03-13T14:58:31Z", "is_private": false}]
