Images and file downloads wouldn't be delivered to them then, saving bandwidth.\n\n\nThis issue is similare to bug #17936, but this here is a feature request.\n\n[1] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.7", "id": 188339, "time": "2016-02-10T19:41:47Z", "creator": "cweiske+bz.apache.org@cweiske.de", "creation_time": "2016-02-10T19:41:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
