This will\nprobably be the final \"release\" based on my personal translation of the NIST \ntests to JUnit.  The files can be downloaded from\nhttp://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8114&release_id=36555\n \nXerces-J 1.4.0 and the CVS version of Crimson pass all the NIST tests.  Xerces \nfails my experimental events tests since the release version expects\nDocumentEvent.createEvent(\"Event\") not (\"Events\").  You can run just the \nofficial NIST tests by using\nnet.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.dom1.nist.NISTDOM1Test as the main class.\n \nBatik still has a lot of test failures, primarily due to not maintaining DTD \ninformation.  I haven't confirmed that all the DOM issues that I reported \nbefore the\nBatik 1.0 release were fixed.\n \nThe tests are pretty easy to run.  If you have a JAXP compatible parser in your \nclasspath or have Xerces, Crimson or XML4J in the same directory, you can\njust run \n \njava -jar domunit.jar\n \nIf you want to run the Oracle V2 parser, you need a JAXP implementation (either \njaxp.jar or xerces.jar) in the classpath or current directory and then\n \njava \n-Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=net.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.Orac\nleDocumentBuilderFactory\n \nTo run Batik, you need some subset of the Batik jars (there are now like 10 of \nthem and I'm not sure what subset is necessary) in the same directory and a\nJAXP compatible SAX parser (xerces.jar or jaxp.jar + crimson.jar)\n \njava \n-Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=net.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.Bati\nkDocumentBuilderFactory\n \nThe output will document 5 or so switches that allow you to test ignoring \nwhitespace, validating, expanding enities, etc", "id": 2642, "time": "2001-05-24T09:01:12Z", "bug_id": 1889, "creation_time": "2001-05-24T09:01:12Z", "is_private": false}]
