This friday morning \nwe had a call from our customer that their web site was down. We noticed that \nthis was the case for 100 other customers too. We also noticed that this was \nbecause Apache wasn't running. Of course we tried to start it but it wouldn't \nstart. First it was because the PID-file existed. Erasing it helped a bit - \nApache is running again.. but it died immediteally after the first request. So \nwe thought to check the semaphore arrays if they were filled up - clearing them \ndidn't help either. After 30 minutes when we had tried everything.. we checked \nthe error log and saw it was huge (though there was nothing intresting). We \ntried rotating it.. and voila, apache runs smooth and fine again. The error log \nwas 2147483647 bytes in size. My guess is, when apache tried to write something \nin the log, it crashed somehow because it was so huge. Apache only crashed on \npages which had missing images or anything else that caused an entry in the \nerror log.", "id": 57390, "time": "2004-05-14T07:15:44Z", "bug_id": 28968, "creation_time": "2004-05-14T07:15:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28968, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 13511 ***", "id": 57399, "time": "2004-05-14T11:06:16Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2004-05-14T11:06:16Z", "is_private": false}]
