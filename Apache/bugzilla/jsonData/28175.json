The client is an applet that puts requests in the POST \noperation at a rate of several times/second.  The response goes back to the \napplet.  The POST is done to the same URL every time.\n\nApache seems to allocate memory for each POST and never releases the memory.  \nAfter running for about a day, Apache has used about 2 GBytes of memory.  The 2 \nGBytes are memory resident (not paged out).  Apache responsiveness with 2 \nGBytes of memory is very slow even though the machine has 4 GBytes of memory.\n\nThere seems to be no indication of hung sockets or incomplete transactions.\n\nMore information - we are using multi-processor PCs running Windows 2000 SP3 \nand we have set:\nWin32DisableAcceptEx\n\nProxypass statements looks like:\n\n<IfModule mod_proxy.c>\nProxyRequests On\n\n<Proxy *>\n    Order deny,allow\n#    Deny from .yahoo.com\n    Allow from all\n</Proxy>\n\n#\n# Enable/disable the handling of HTTP/1.1 \"Via:\" headers.\n# (\"Full\" adds the server version; \"Block\" removes all outgoing Via: headers)\n# Set to one of: Off | On | Full | Block\n#\nProxyVia On\nProxyPass /dfc2block2 http://dfc2appserver:7012/dfc2block2/\nProxyPass /CoMotion/ http://www.apacheserver:7787/CoMotion/\nProxyPass /network_monitor/ http://wl8/network_monitor/\nProxyPass /NetOps/ http://netopsserver:7003/NetOps/\n\n</IfModule>\n# End of proxy directives.\n\nApache 2.0.49 was installed with the standard Apache Windows installer and is \nrunning as a service.
