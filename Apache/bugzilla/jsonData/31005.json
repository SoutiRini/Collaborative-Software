Currently, 1.6.1 does not display this information.  Also, \nif it does throw an exception, that file in the <copy> destination directory \nshould not be created so that on the second invocation of the <copy> the file \ndoes get copied otherwise to the user, it appears that the <copy> completed \nsuccessfully because the zero length file still gets created."}]
