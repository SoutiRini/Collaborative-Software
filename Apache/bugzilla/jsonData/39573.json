There is no need to shout.\n\n2. The JAXRPC servlet is sat in the middle of your stack trace. This suggests an\napplciation / JAXRPC issue to me. The exception is expected when the client\ncloses the connection before it has sent all the data. I wonder whether JAXRPC\ncorrectly handles this situation?\n\n3. You have provided no information on how to reproduce this issue.\n\n4. You have reported this issue against a very old version of Tomcat. I would\nsuggest an upgrade to at least 4.1.31 and better still the latest 5.5.x (not\nthat I expect it to help with this issue)\n\n5. This question belongs on the users list until such time there is some\nevidence of a Tomcat bug."}]
