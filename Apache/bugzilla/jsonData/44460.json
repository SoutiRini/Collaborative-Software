When you work with\nit, just imagine you're working with PDFBox or iText from where you don't have\naccess to FOP classes. The PDF classes basically expose an object model for PDF.\nYour code (in the render.pdf package) should set the right values on this object\nmodel. That may mean that you have to expose some value once on the value object\n(for FOP) and once in the PDF library. So I wouldn't duplicate the value object,\njust provide concrete getters/setter on the dictionary subclasses. I hope you\nunderstand what I mean.\n\n<snip/>\n", "attachment_id": null, "id": 98914, "creation_time": "2008-02-26T09:15:44Z", "time": "2008-02-26T09:15:44Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "bug_id": 44460, "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 127826, "time": "2009-06-10T13:23:18Z", "bug_id": 44460, "creation_time": "2009-06-10T13:23:18Z", "tags": [], "text": "Reset assignee so mails go to list."}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44460, "text": "I've taken Andrejus' patch and addressed my concerns on the original patch.
