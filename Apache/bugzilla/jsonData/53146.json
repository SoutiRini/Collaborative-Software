It contains two fo:blocks: a text with a long Unix file path. \n\nThe only difference here is a Zero Width Space (ZWS, U+200B) at appropriate locations (here: after the \"/\") and the hyphenation attribute. The ZWS is used to indicate possible break opportunities in case hyphenation=false.\n\nHowever, in the 2nd block, the beginning of the path /usr/... is broken into \"/\", a linebreak, and \"usr/...\" although hyphenate=false. I'm not sure if this is the correct behavior. Also compare the word spacing in the 1st block.\n\nI would have expected no linbreak between \"/\" and \"usr\" and a more \"balanced\" space between words (although it might be technically problematic). :)\n\nI'll upload also two PDFs, one built with FOP, the other built with XEP.", "id": 158410, "time": "2012-04-25T11:54:41Z", "creator": "tom_schr@web.de", "creation_time": "2012-04-25T11:54:41Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53146, "attachment_id": 28678, "text": "Created attachment 28678\nFO file built with FOP 1.0", "id": 158411, "time": "2012-04-25T11:55:22Z", "creator": "tom_schr@web.de", "creation_time": "2012-04-25T11:55:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53146, "attachment_id": 28679, "id": 158412, "time": "2012-04-25T11:56:08Z", "creator": "tom_schr@web.de", "creation_time": "2012-04-25T11:56:08Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 28679\nFO file built with XEP 4.19 build 20110414"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53146, "attachment_id": null, "text": "lower priority since no patch is available", "id": 158427, "time": "2012-04-25T15:26:57Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-25T15:26:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53146, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi Thomas,\n\nyou didn't actually specify text-align=\"justify\" on the second block. If you do then you get the same behaviour as in the first block, which is expected since the hyphen is explicit. So it's always allowed to break after it even if hyphenation has been set to false.\n\nAs to the fact that when text-align is not set to \"justify\", then a break is made after the first \"/\", then I believe it's compliant with the line-breaking rules defined in Unicode UAX #14:\nhttp://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/#SY\n\nIn order to prevent that, you would have to define a rule that says something like \"Do not break between a solidus and a letter if that solidus is preceded by white space.\" I believe this is outside the scope of UAX #14.\n\nIn that case, I think the solution is to put a Word Joiner (U+2060) between the first \"/\" and the rest of the URL.\n\nClosing this bug as invalid, feel free to re-open it if you don't agree with the analysis.\n\nVincent", "id": 158451, "time": "2012-04-26T14:13:00Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-04-26T14:13:00Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53146, "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition resolved+invalid to closed+invalid", "id": 158540, "time": "2012-04-30T00:11:31Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-30T00:11:31Z", "is_private": false}]
