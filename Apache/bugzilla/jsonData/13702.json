Currently,  you can only append something to the\nend of the log file name.  For example, if you name your file MyApp.log, and use\nthe date pattern '.'yyyy-MM-dd'.log', your log file will be named something like\nMyApp.log.2002-10-16.log.  It would be nice to name the file\nMyApp.2002-10-16.log (removing the duplicate extension).  \n\nOne possibility would be a setting to allow specifying the entire log file name.\n For example:\n\n   'MyApp.'yyyy-MM-dd'.log'\n\nMy second request would be to allow the filenames to be named to include the\ndate when they are created (instead of when they roll over).  One option might\nbe to allow the above log file specifier to be applied to the 'file' property of\nthe DailyRollingFileAppender.", "id": 24649, "time": "2002-10-16T17:36:08Z", "creator": "bogofilter+apache.org@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2002-10-16T17:36:08Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13702, "attachment_id": null, "id": 68288, "time": "2004-12-10T19:58:46Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2004-12-10T19:58:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "log4j 1.3 allows you complete control over this via its new RollingPolicy and \nrelated classes."}]
