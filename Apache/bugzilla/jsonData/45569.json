When parsing the catalogs in Catalog.parseCatalogFile, the first thing that occurs is creating a URL of the current working directory, which requires a grant to the \"user.dir\" PropertyPermission.  Creating this URL is unnecessary when an absolute path to the catalog is passed in and the grant would also be unnecessary.\n\nTo alleviate this condition, a URL can be attempted to be made from the fileName first and if a MalformedURLException occurs, treat it as a relative path.  In essence:\n\ntry {\n  base = new URL(fixSlashes(fileName));\n} catch (MalformedURLException mue) {\n ...\n}\n\nAlternatively, there can be a mode set or passed in to treat the fileName appropriately."}]
