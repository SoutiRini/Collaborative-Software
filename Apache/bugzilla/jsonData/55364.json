I could live with that.\n\n- The following HTML is returned as body:\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\n<html><head>\n<title>400 Bad Request</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1>Bad Request</h1>\n<p>Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.<br />\nReason: You're speaking plain HTTP to an SSL-enabled server port.<br />\nInstead use the HTTPS scheme to access this URL, please.<br />\n<blockquote>Hint: <a href=\"https://localhost/\"><b>https://localhost/</b></a></blockquote></p>\n<hr>\n<address>Apache/2.2.22 (Debian) Server at <a href=\"mailto:lcg-admin@lists.lrz.de\">localhost</a> Port 443</address>\n</body></html>\n\n- no content type is given so browsers will render this as plain text\n=> bug, either set the content type or don't return HTML\n\n- 200 OK Status is given back.\nFor sure this can't be OK... I'm not sure whether the SSL/TLS standards specify anything for that case... but I'd rather guess that *IF* anything is returned,... it should be the 400 mentioned also in the HTML.\n\nBut does/should mod_ssl actually return ANY HTTP at all, in that case?\nIs there any RFC which specifies this?\n\n\nCheers,\nChris.", "id": 169156, "time": "2013-08-06T01:40:01Z", "creator": "calestyo@scientia.net", "creation_time": "2013-08-06T01:40:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55364, "attachment_id": null, "id": 169157, "time": "2013-08-06T01:57:42Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-08-06T01:57:42Z", "is_private": false, "text": "HTTP 0.9 doesn't have a status line or response headers, and that's the most we're willing to do for a response to HTTP on an HTTPS report.

IMHO it's generally questionable, that when connecting to HTTPS and that fails, that one get's HTTP back.\nUnder bad circumstances (stupid checks, which don't recognise that SSL handshake failed) that content might be even \"trusted\"... (but of course that would be a security problem in such clients... not Apache).\n\nAnyway... IMHO, either nothing should be returned at all (which I'd probably prefer), or a new enough HTTP versions should be used, so that _at least_ a HTTP Status could be set that things gone wrong.\nAnd if the HTTP version is not new enough to set a Content-Type, plain text should be returned, not HTTP.\n\n\nAnyway... as said.. I haven't looked up the RFCs whether they mandate any behaviour in that case... so the above is just what I'd do out of common sense.\n\n\nCheers,\nChris."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "working as designed, open an enhancement if you want to be able to suppress it or respond differently.", "id": 169200, "time": "2013-08-06T19:16:58Z", "bug_id": 55364, "creation_time": "2013-08-06T19:16:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "attachment_id": null, "text": "this is fixed in 2.4.3 and 2.2.24\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 50823 ***", "id": 169285, "time": "2013-08-07T21:51:15Z", "bug_id": 55364, "creation_time": "2013-08-07T21:51:15Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55364, "attachment_id": null, "id": 169623, "time": "2013-08-20T21:42:44Z", "creator": "calestyo@scientia.net", "creation_time": "2013-08-20T21:42:44Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Hi Stefan.\n\nSince Eric suggested to open a separate request for enhancement, I did this just before and opened bug #55458, only to see your comment now...\n\nWhat exactly was changed in 2.4.3 and 2.2.24?\n\n\nCheers,\nChris."}]
