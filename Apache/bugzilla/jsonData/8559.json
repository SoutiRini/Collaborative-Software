[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "It would be usefull to add <fileset> to <arg>, I see a case where you would use \nthis feature. \n\nFor example if you like to pass all the files with **/*.java or **/*.sqlj to \nthe argument for execution you would use something like this (See last section):\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    <java classname=\"sqlj.tools.Sqlj\">\n      <arg value=\"-linemap=0\"/>\n      <arg value=\"-user=\"/>\n      <arg value=\"-status=1\"/>\n      <arg value=\"-compile=0\"/>\n      <arg value=\"-explain=1\"/>\n      <arg value=\"-warn=all\"/>\n      <arg value=\"-d=${build.temp.translated_sqlj}\"/>\n      <arg value=\"-dir=${build.temp.translated_sqlj}\"/>\n\n      <arg>\n        <fileset dir=\"${cc.src}\" casesensitive=\"yes\" >\n          <patternset>\n            <include name=\"**/*.sqlj\"/>\n            <include name=\"**/*.java\"/>\n          </patternset>\n        </fileset>\n      </arg>\n    </java>\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nAnother feature to add is a directory finder tag that works with <arg> for \nfinding directories that contains certain files such as **/*.sqlj or **/*.java \nand include the path directory plus the \"*.java\" or \"*.sqlj\" (Just the \nwildcard \"*.java\", not replacing \"*\" with the actual file names). See example:\n--------------------------------------\nMy src/com/sun/tools/ directory has java files.\nThe new directory finder tag would add \"src/com/sun/tools/*.java\" to the \ncommand line argument. If the directory doesn't have *.java files then it'll be \nexcluded. Let's make adding \"*.java\" an optional argrument to the \n<directoryfinder>.\n\nhere's an example:\n\n  <arg>\n    <directoryfinder appendExtension=\"yes\">\n       <include name=\"**/*.sqlj\"/>      \n       <include name=\"**/*.java\"/>      \n    </directoryfinder>\n  <arg>\n\nThe result for the arg would look something like this:\nAll results are in one line and seperated by space, we should customize the \ndelimeters.\n\ne.x. \"src/com/sun/tools/*.java src/com/sun/tools/ext/*.sqlj ...\"\n--------------------------------------\n\n- Benjamin", "is_private": false, "id": 14837, "creator": "benjachi@yahoo.com", "time": "2002-04-26T14:05:19Z", "bug_id": 8559, "creation_time": "2002-04-26T14:05:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "I really feel this is pushing the limits of what <java> should provide rather \nthan encouraging folks to write wrapper Ant tasks for the Java programs they \ninvoke.
