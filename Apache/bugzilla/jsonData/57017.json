Updating the menu to sthml was no problem. The problem is too many clients were bypassing the menu and did not know that the url was changed. As a work-around, wrote 40 small html files that redirects html requests to shtml\n\nSuggested fix:\n  If client requests foo.html\n  and server does not have foo.html and does have foo.shtml, then\n\n  1. Process ssi as usual\n  2  Change suffix of exported file from shtml to html\n\nThank you"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57017, "attachment_id": null, "text": "You could configure SSI a different way, or use mod_rewrite to poke around to satisfy the request, but this isn't a bug in the server or any feasible enhancement.", "id": 178095, "time": "2014-09-25T01:38:21Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-09-25T01:38:21Z", "is_private": false}]
