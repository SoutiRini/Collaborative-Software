Since I didn't find a clean way to do this I patched the retry task to support a 'retryDelay' attribute. This simply sets the time to sleep between different retry attempts. We currently use this on our build server to retry SVN updates which might fail because multiple jobs are updating the same sandbox concurrently. So far it's been working fine.\n \nThe attached patch has only been compiled/tested against java 1.6, but I guess it should be fine in older versions as well.\n \nThe output, when a retryDelay is set looks like this:\nupdateLib:\n     [echo] Start library update...\n      [svn] svn: Working copy 'C:\\BuildSystem\\Libraries' locked; try performing 'cleanup'\n      [svn] svn: Working copy 'C:\\BuildSystem\\Libraries' locked; try performing 'cleanup'\n      [svn] <Update> failed.\n    [retry] Attempt [0]: error occurred; retrying after 1000 ms...\n      [svn] svn: Working copy 'C:\\BuildSystem\\Libraries' locked; try performing 'cleanup'\n      [svn] svn: Working copy 'C:\\BuildSystem\\Libraries' locked; try performing 'cleanup'\n      [svn] <Update> failed.\n    [retry] Attempt [1]: error occurred; retrying after 1000 ms...\n     [echo] Update done...", "attachment_id": 27839, "bug_id": 52076, "id": 150874, "time": "2011-10-24T13:23:10Z", "creator": "apache@avee.org", "creation_time": "2011-10-24T13:23:10Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I might update the patch which an increasing delay if there's a use for that.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52076, "id": 150875, "time": "2011-10-24T13:23:47Z", "creator": "apache@avee.org", "creation_time": "2011-10-24T13:23:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52076, "text": "A slightly modified version of the patch is in as svn revision 1211004\n\nIt would be nice if you could add a patch for the manual and maybe even a test as well.", "id": 152006, "time": "2011-12-06T16:34:22Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-12-06T16:34:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52076, "text": "added documentation with svn revision 1239108", "id": 153342, "time": "2012-02-01T12:47:46Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-02-01T12:47:46Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
