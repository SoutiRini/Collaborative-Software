This is the case the\n   * second branch of the if statement below catches for backwards\n   * compatibility.\n   */\n\nYet this \"backwards compatibility\" clause conflicts with the documentation ?\nOr am I missing something ?\n\nmy build file:\n\n\n<project name=\"MS_DCTM_Migration\" basedir=\".\" default=\"mychmod\">\n <target name=\"mychmod\">\n<chmod file=\"myFolder\" perm=\"a+w\"/>\n</target>\n</project>", "id": 96270, "time": "2006-11-28T06:58:49Z", "creator": "dominique.demunck@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-11-28T06:58:49Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41054, "attachment_id": null, "text": "documented in svn rev 687765", "id": 119989, "time": "2008-08-21T06:58:29Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-08-21T06:58:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41054, "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 47118 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 127016, "time": "2009-05-14T05:50:52Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-05-14T05:50:52Z", "attachment_id": null}]
