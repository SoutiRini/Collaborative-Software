'\\'in quotes\\'' : ''}\">test</div>\n\nI seems that the expression \"'\\'test\\''\" leads to the the problem because including it in parenthesis solves the problem in 7.0.54:\n\n<div title=\"${empty myVar ? ('\\'in quotes\\'') : ''}\">test</div>\n\nThe problem is that we have a lot of similar expressions containing escaped single quotes in our webapp.\n\nThanks for your help,\nChristof Luick.", "id": 176437, "time": "2014-07-16T19:47:18Z", "bug_id": 56731, "creation_time": "2014-07-16T19:47:18Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 31822}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "text": "The issue is known and already fixed and mentioned in changelog.\nThe sample works with the current tc7.0.x\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 56334 ***", "id": 176451, "time": "2014-07-17T11:17:30Z", "bug_id": 56731, "creation_time": "2014-07-17T11:17:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
