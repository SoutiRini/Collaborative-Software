If load balance members really must not appear in the worker.list directive, I suggest to include in the Reference Guide a brief note about why they must not be listed. Besides, if there is a legitimate way of accessing a single node of a load balancer, it should referenced."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48631, "text": "Thanks for the suggestion.
