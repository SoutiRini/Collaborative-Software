[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi.\n\nAs noted in bug #52703 comment #10, the parsing of SSLProtocol is different from similar directives like (Options or SSLOptions).\n\nIn the later two, the +/- are only used to control the merging between several _directives_ (not their parameters), e.g. like this:\n\nExample A:\nOptions foo bar\nOptions baz\n=> yields in baz\n\nExample B:\nOptions foo bar\nOptions +baz\n=> yields in foo bar baz\n\nExample C:\nOptions foo bar\n=> yields in foo bar\n\n\nBut for SSLProtocol, this seems to be different:\nSSLProtocol foo bar\n=> yields JUST in bar\n\n\nI guess most users will see the \"+/-\" in the documentation and believe in good faith, that the behaviour is the same.\n\nSo could this either be adapted (IMHO the preferred solution, thus the report against mod_ssl) or at least be clarified in the documentation.\n\nThanks,\nChris.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 52821, "id": 154496, "time": "2012-03-04T16:31:19Z", "creator": "calestyo@scientia.net", "creation_time": "2012-03-04T16:31:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52821, "attachment_id": null, "id": 154498, "time": "2012-03-04T16:48:48Z", "creator": "calestyo@scientia.net", "creation_time": "2012-03-04T16:48:48Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Oh, and obviously the same applies to SSLProxyProtocol."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "calestyo@scientia.net", "attachment_id": null, "text": "And one more thing:\n\nIf you decide to just change the documentation, then please clarify also the effect of the following:\n\nSSLProtocol foo\nSSLProtocol bar\n=> This yields likely in just \"bar\"\n\nbut what about:\nSSLProtocol foo\nSSLProtocol +bar\n=> Is this just \"bar\" or \"foo bar\"?\n\nIf the later, one should probably document how a cut can be made, i.e. with\nSSLProtocol foo +bar\n(no + in front of foo, but bar)", "id": 154500, "time": "2012-03-04T16:53:20Z", "bug_id": 52821, "creation_time": "2012-03-04T16:53:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52821, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 52820 ***", "id": 154502, "time": "2012-03-04T19:01:07Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-03-04T19:01:07Z", "is_private": false}]
