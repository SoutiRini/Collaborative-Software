Data is not displaying completely on the browser for large tables in the newer version. However, when i run the same application on the older version 5.x, it works very well. \nWhen I see the source code of the generated html, it is incomplete and truncated in the middle. \nI tried 3 days to solve this issue on the newer version playing with buffering and all without any success. \nPlease check and let me know if this is a bug in the newer version or if I need to configure a setting on the newer version. \n\nIt seems to be an big issue. \n\nI cannot attached the source code as it is client specific. \n\nThanks\nChirag Gupta"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48193, "attachment_id": null, "id": 131932, "time": "2009-11-13T09:46:07Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-11-13T09:46:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla isn't a support forum.
