That should work, unless... Do you have a keep-together or keep-with-next/-previous specified on the rows or the table. In that case, you probably want to change this to an explicit keep-together.within-page, keep-with-previous.within-page. If the component 'within-page' is not explicitly used, then keep-together also means keep-together.within-line, which overrides preserved linefeeds.\n", "id": 114469, "time": "2008-03-10T11:51:28Z", "bug_id": 44434, "creation_time": "2008-03-10T11:51:28Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 114470, "time": "2008-03-10T11:54:10Z", "bug_id": 44434, "creation_time": "2008-03-10T11:54:10Z", "tags": [], "text": "(In reply to comment #5)\n> \n> That's what the linefeed character (&#x0A;) is for.
