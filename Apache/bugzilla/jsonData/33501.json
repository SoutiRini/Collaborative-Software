[{"text": "I'm not sure if this is an Apache bug or a compatibility issue. I recently set\nup a webserver on my home pc with apache because I was so frustrated that I\ncouldn't find a free hosting service with Perl installed. Well my website is\nrunning fine, except, when left running for long periods of time no one can\naccess it, they get a browser time out. It seems that every time this happens\nall I have to do is stop and restart apache. I'm not sure if this is related to\nthe firewall I'm using, DNS domain service I'm using or other such things.\nPlease let me know, thanks!", "tags": [], "creator": "theboy@butcheredboy.dns2go.com", "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 70787, "time": "2005-02-10T21:14:36Z", "bug_id": 33501, "creation_time": "2005-02-10T21:14:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "Please try a user support forum: http://httpd.apache.org/lists.html#http-users", "tags": [], "bug_id": 33501, "attachment_id": null, "count": 1, "id": 72127, "time": "2005-03-10T14:33:26Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2005-03-10T14:33:26Z", "is_private": false}]
