As it is not developed anymore, my company is planning to do a fork this product \nto make it usable to apache 2.2. (URL of the old project page is: http://authzldap.othello.ch/ )\n\nThe module is using the following  openssl funtions for getting the stings for the issuer and the subject:\n* X509_get_issuer_name(x)\n* X509_get_subject_name(x)\n\nThis functions are implemented to conform to RFC 2985.\n\nmod_ssl is using openssl, but does some things different from every other standard I know.\n\nIf I look to the pem file of a certificate I find:\n\n\n  Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=DE, ST=Germany, L=Hamburg, O=digitec GmbH, O=digitec, OU=Secure Enterprise Service, CN=Digitec Root CA (2048 bit)/emailAddress=ca@digitec.de\n..\n        Subject: C=DE, ST=Germany, L=Hamburg, O=digitec GmbH, O=digitec, OU=Secure Enterprise Services, CN=Sven Anders [san]/emailAddress=s.anders@digitec.de\n                DirName:/C=DE/ST=Germany/L=Hamburg/O=digitec GmbH/O=digitec/OU=Secure Enterprise Service/CN=Digitec Root CA (2048 bit)/emailAddress=ca@digitec.de\n                \n\nEverywhere emailaddress= (not Email=) is used.\n\nCan you give me an example of standards where EMail= is used?\n\nBest Regards\n\nSven Anders"}]
