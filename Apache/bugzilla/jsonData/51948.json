So when I later try to read the comments part, it will serve me the old data, originally read from the file and not what I have written to it. It will however write the correct data.\n\nI know there are workarounds, but still I'd like to file this as a bug.\n\nIMHO, it's necessary to get rid of the strange conversion done in PackagePart.getOutputStream(). That really is weird. But that's just my opinion then. Any ideas? Or am I expecting the wrong thing from POI framework or misusing the API?\n\nI was using 3.8-beta4", "id": 150113, "time": "2011-10-04T09:32:25Z", "creator": "bernd.fuhrmann@stm-media.de", "creation_time": "2011-10-04T09:32:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 27683}]
