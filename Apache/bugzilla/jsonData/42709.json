[{"text": "*****************\nSECURITY FLAW\n*****************\n\n1. /etc/httpd.conf prevents the viewing of .ht* files by default with these lines:\n\n<Files ~ \"^\\.ht\">\n    Order allow,deny\n    Deny from all\n</Files>\n\n2. It works (i.e. prevents viewing) in most instances.\n\n3. HOWEVER, if a user has logged in successfully using .htaccess validation, he\nis able to view the .htaccess file (or even the .htpasswd file if it is stored\nin public_html) using a browser.\n\n\n**************************************\nSequence for reproduction of bug\n**************************************\n\n1. Create .htaccess with the following contents\n\n<Files ~ \"^\\.ht\">\n    Order allow,deny\n    Deny from all\n</Files>\n\nAuthName \"Restricted Access\"\nAuthUserFile /home/mydomain.com/public_html/.htpasswd\nAuthType Basic\n\n<Limit GET PUT POST>\norder deny,allow\ndeny from all\nrequire valid-user\nsatisfy any\n</Limit>\n\n2. Place .htaccess into /home/mydomain.com/public_html/\n\n3. Create .htpasswd with a user name and encrypted password, and place it in\n/home/mydomain.com/public_html/\n\n\n4. When accessing http://www.mydomain.com/.htaccess , you will be prompted for a\nlogin and password.\n\n5. If you enter an invalid login or click cancel, you will get a Error 403 message.\n\n6. Now, try accessing http://www.mydomain.com/.htaccess again and this time\nenter a valid login that you've created in .htpasswd.\n\n7. You will see the contents inside the .htaccess\n\n8. If you assess http://www.mydomain.com/.htpasswd , you will also see the\ncontents of the file.\n\n9. This means that a valid user can view the absolute path of where the\n.htpasswd is stored. And if .htpasswd is placed in public_html, it can also be\nviewed.", "tags": [], "creator": "ginger.admino@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 104583, "time": "2007-06-20T17:48:46Z", "bug_id": 42709, "creation_time": "2007-06-20T17:48:46Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Please RTFM for \"Satisfy\"", "attachment_id": null, "id": 104587, "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "time": "2007-06-20T22:53:43Z", "bug_id": 42709, "creation_time": "2007-06-20T22:53:43Z", "is_private": false}]
