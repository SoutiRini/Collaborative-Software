McClanahan)\n\nThere is still an implementation bug and a spec bug:\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:  When translating a JSP syntax page to XML syntax, we need to\ncollapse multiple \"import\" attributes into a single one, with commas separating\nall the different expressions.\n\nSPECIFICATION:  Section 5.3.4 (the page directive) needs to be changed to\nmandate this translation.  In addition, it might be appropriate to mention\nsomeplace that an XML-syntax input page cannot have two \"import\" attributes on\nthe <jsp:directive.page> element.\n", "id": 6488, "time": "2001-10-08T18:31:02Z", "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "creation_time": "2001-10-08T18:31:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "text": "Fixed the translation of JSP syntax to XML syntax problem mentioned above.", "id": 6510, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 4022, "creation_time": "2001-10-09T11:50:43Z", "time": "2001-10-09T11:50:43Z", "is_private": false}]
