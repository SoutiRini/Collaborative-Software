In the latter case, we'd better check the value in the parsing function.\n\nThanks,\nTianyin", "id": 165327, "time": "2013-02-18T22:36:57Z", "bug_id": 54578, "creation_time": "2013-02-18T22:36:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 54578, "is_private": false, "id": 165329, "time": "2013-02-18T22:46:06Z", "creator": "tixu@cs.ucsd.edu", "creation_time": "2013-02-18T22:46:06Z", "tags": [], "text": "The same thing for \"LimitRequestBody\", the docs say\n\n\"the number of bytes from 0 (meaning unlimited) to 2147483647 (2GB)\"\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody\n\nI set the number to be 2147483648 and my httpd server starts without any problem.
