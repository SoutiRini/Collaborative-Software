[{"count": 0, "text": "JMeter seems to expect a lot of the constructors of the JUnit test class, e.g. the standard constructor, a constructor with just a String argument and all libraries that are used within the constructor (e.g. someone uses jlog inside the constructor, the jlog-library has to be provided).\n\nWhile all these requirements are reasonable, the error message is not. In all those cases the only message is \u201cfailed to create an instance of the class\u201d, which gives no hint or help what is wrong or missing.
