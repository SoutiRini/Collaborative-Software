It hasn't seen much real-life use yet, but we're testing it on 2.2.16 based server. As far as I can tell it provides desired better error reporting. It seems code in 2.3.8 is still the same in this area.\n\nCurrently if client certificate verification fails, there's relatively little in server logs to allow diagnosis of what went wrong - there's no information about the certificate or the issuer. This patch reports subject and issuer names as well as certificate validity period.\n\nWe hope this helps us better determine why errors happen, and to harvest useful warnings for operators from the logs."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "lat@iki.fi", "text": "Created attachment 26176\nssl_callback_SSLVerify patch to report more info on failure", "id": 140749, "time": "2010-10-14T09:00:33Z", "bug_id": 50094, "creation_time": "2010-10-14T09:00:33Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 26176}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "attachment_id": null, "id": 140771, "time": "2010-10-16T05:54:07Z", "bug_id": 50094, "creation_time": "2010-10-16T05:54:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for the patch.
