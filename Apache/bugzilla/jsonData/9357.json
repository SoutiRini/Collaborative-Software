Creating a \nConsoleLogger with a target of \"System.err\" sets the target properly. \n(target=\"System.err\";)\n2. Then calling setTarget with a bogus value results in targetWarn \nbeing called which informs the user that \"System.out\" will be used as a default (when really \nSystem.err has been set successfully in the previous operation).\n\nFix:\n#Line 80\n<< \nLogLog.warn(\"Using System.out (default).\");\n>> LogLog.warn(\"Using \" + target + \" (set \npreviously).\");"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "text": "\nThanks.", "count": 1, "id": 17504, "time": "2002-06-10T17:36:46Z", "bug_id": 9357, "creation_time": "2002-06-10T17:36:46Z", "is_private": false}]
