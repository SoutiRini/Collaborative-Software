Don't\nask how long it took me to find out, that despite the presence of a regular\nROOT/index.jsp and despite the above statement the default page comes from\neither WEB-INF/classes or from WEB-INF/lib/catalina-root.jar.\n\nI'm pretty puzzled why one might try to obfuscate example code in such a\nfashion, but at least the text of the page should be changed. I can imagine that\nthis is there to improve performace on the very first impression -- but at what\nprice?!\n\nIf this is the reason, then please consider also: I think it is nearly always\none of the first steps of a new tomcat user to try to change this page and see\nwhat happens.
