What this means is that:\n\n1) The main non-chrooted DocumentRoot is checked during started resulting in the \"DocumentRoot must be a directory\" error being logged and startup failing unless this unused directory exists.\n\n2) There is no check performed for the DocumentRoot in the chroot jail during startup."}]
