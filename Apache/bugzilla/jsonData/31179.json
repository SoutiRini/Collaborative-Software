An easy way your team could support\nall these views is to make Chainsaw an Eclipse stand-alone application.  Eclipse\nalready supports a very flexible and modern XML based extension facility.   By\nadopting Eclipse, Chainsaw would become a very powerful process viewer indeed.\n \nRegards,"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31179, "attachment_id": null, "id": 63431, "time": "2004-09-12T22:10:28Z", "creator": "psmith@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-09-12T22:10:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "As an Eclipse IDE user, I have already been thinking about such a thing..."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31179, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 119296, "time": "2008-08-02T15:16:58Z", "creator": "thorbjoern@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-08-02T15:16:58Z", "text": "Is this a priority for the 1.0 release?"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "psmith@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 119439, "creation_time": "2008-08-05T15:16:06Z", "time": "2008-08-05T15:16:06Z", "bug_id": 31179, "text": "No, this is definitely not on the 2.0 Radar (Chainsaw 1.0 is 'embedded' within 1.2.x already).", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31179, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 119501, "time": "2008-08-06T07:29:14Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-08-06T07:29:14Z", "text": "Clearing NEEDINFO."}]
