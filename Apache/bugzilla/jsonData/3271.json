[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3271, "text": "I passed the Jar task a manifest file consisting of a single line specifying the \"Main-Class\" attribute, but the manifest that was written to the jar file was merely Ant's default manifest, with its \"Manifest-Version\" and \"Created-By\" attributes.  There were no error messages; it just seemed to ignore my manifest file.  The problem is that the constructor for the Manifest class starts out by reading the first line of the manifest file, but never does anything with it.  This is okay if the first line contains the \"Manifest-Version\" attribute, since the class supplies a default value to replace the dropped line.  But I can't believe this is the intended behavior; the \"Manifest-Version\" attribute has to be in the first line if it's present at all, but it is NOT required.", "id": 4834, "time": "2001-08-25T02:53:56Z", "creator": "alan_moore@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2001-08-25T02:53:56Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "It was a bug - I fixed it.
