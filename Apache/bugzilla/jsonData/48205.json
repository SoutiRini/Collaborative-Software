If needed unit test cases can be created, but that depends upon my availability.\n\nForum Entry can be found at :\nhttp://old.nabble.com/POI-3.5-Memory-and-perfomance-solution-td26313991.html\n\nFor Reference:\n--------------\nThis is continuation of thread at below location:\nhttp://old.nabble.com/Memory-and-perfomance-issues-td25990601.html\n\nWe have extended Yegor's BiggridDemo and provided some more features. I have attached approach document for attached eclipse project. This project also contains ready to run program (ExcelDemo.java).\n\nThis solution does not cover 100% of Excel features but targets most of the sweet spots.\n\nWe would like to know how best we can utilize this code in POI.\n\nNote: ooxml-schemas-1.0.jar, xmlbean-2.3.0.jar and poi-3.5-beta7-20090602.jar files are not included in eclipse project due to file size limitation.
