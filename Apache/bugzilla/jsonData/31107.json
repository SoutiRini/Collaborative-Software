In case others have the same problem, I'll post the c code here on\nhow to set binary mode for stdin.  This works for the MinGW compiler.  It is\npobably a bit different for Microsoft's compiler.\n\n#include <io.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n.....\nsetmode(fileno(stdin),O_BINARY);", "id": 63213, "time": "2004-09-08T14:49:05Z", "creator": "apache.org@plaza1.net", "creation_time": "2004-09-08T14:49:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31107, "text": "Thanks for the feedback!", "id": 63218, "time": "2004-09-08T15:22:44Z", "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "creation_time": "2004-09-08T15:22:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
