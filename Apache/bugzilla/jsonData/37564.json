[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hello.\n\nThis is not a bug but merely a suggestion.\nI am trying to install some software and I realise that it would be beautiful \nto be able to define the SuexecUserGroup from the mod_suexec module not only \nin the VirtualHosts, but also in the <Directory> sections.\nHowever, this should most probably be a feature for the httpd.conf ONLY, and \nnot in the .htaccess, to avoid having people getting rights that they are not \nallowed to have.\n\nMaybe there is another better way to do this, but my goal would be to be able \nto run CGIs with another user or group ID than apache. I don't like the \n<VirtualHost> mean to do that, because we cannot do an SSL connection if we \nhave only one IP address. Therefore putting SuexecUserGroup in the <Directory> \ntag would be a great solution to overcome those problems, if there is not too \nmany security concerns about it (I don't know).\nWe can see that problem typically when installing the 'sympa' mailing list \nsoftware.\n\nThanks for listening.\nRegards,\nDaniel", "is_private": false, "id": 82680, "creator": "dan1@edenpics.com", "time": "2005-11-19T11:08:19Z", "bug_id": 37564, "creation_time": "2005-11-19T11:08:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I updated the enhancement request in bugzilla, because 2.4.10 still doesn't have the feature.
