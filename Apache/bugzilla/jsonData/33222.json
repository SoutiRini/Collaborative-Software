Instead, the newly created session will be reflected\nin the response.\n\nNotice that the word \"requested\" in the method name refers to a session\n*requested and specified by the client*.\n\nFor example, HttpServletRequest.getRequestedSessionId() has this:\n\n     * If the client did not specify a session ID, this method returns\n     * <code>null</code>.\n\nIt may be worth adding a similar comment to isRequestedSessionIdValid(), as follows:\n\n     * If the client did not specify a session ID, this method returns\n     * <code>false</code>.", "bug_id": 33222, "is_private": false, "id": 70090, "time": "2005-01-25T23:35:17Z", "creator": "jan.luehe@sun.com", "creation_time": "2005-01-25T23:35:17Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
