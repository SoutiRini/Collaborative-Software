That seems like a poor choice for the default given that it means that\nif you create a new Context and a new DataSource using the Admin webapp and you\njust accept all the defaults, you will not be able to use the DataSource in your\nnew Context. Also, the Context Container section in the Server Configuration\nReference says that the default value of the property should be \"true\".\n\nSymptom:\nIf you create a Context and DataSource using the Admin webapp and try to use the\nDataSource as explained in the How To guide, you will get this exception:\n\"javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Name java:comp is not bound in this Context\"\nGoogling seems to show a lot of people having this problem. Not sure how often\nit was caused by this issue. It can easily trip up a newbie like me.\n\nTo Reproduce:\nCreate a new Context using the Admin webapp. Do not change any of the default\nvalues for properties. Create a new DataSource in the Context using the Admin\nwebapp and try to use it in the new Context using code from the How To guide."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 90115, "creation_time": "2006-06-12T23:03:53Z", "time": "2006-06-12T23:03:53Z", "bug_id": 39791, "text": "Fixed in SVN.
