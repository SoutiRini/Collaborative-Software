Everything above or outside of that \nbasedir will not be considered when applying the include patterns\". \n\nIf Ant 1.5 supported this behaviour, was it because of a bug? I did not find \nit reported anywhere in release notes/bug reports/docs.\n\nIt looks like filesets looks at the begining of a path to resolve relative \nreferences and not within a path. \nE.g:\n<fileset dir=\"../play\" includes=\"common-1.0.jar,common-2.0.jar\" /> is \nsupported.\n\n-------------\n\nCould you please make the same behaviour, which Ant 1.5 supported, available \nin later versions of Ant? \n\nWe tapped in this \"feature\" of ant to refer a lot of our dependant jars \nsprinkled across different locations. \n\nappreciate any inputs ..\n\nThanks,\nVSarsam"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41604, "attachment_id": null, "id": 100373, "time": "2007-03-14T03:30:49Z", "creator": "peterreilly@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-03-14T03:30:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The design of filesets have always been to use the dir as\na root.
