All these have been tried and have failed.  \n\n  I'm not certain if this is strictly related to JDK1.4, which we are using, or \nother changes that have occurred in Xindice, but this continuing problem needs \nto be solved whether it is related to 1.4 or not.  I'm not being critical \nhere.  I think that the recent resurgence of interest in Xindice is really \ngoing to build a strong product and I am also contributing where possible, but \nI have observed that people have been complaining about XUpdate for months even \ngoing back into v1.0.
