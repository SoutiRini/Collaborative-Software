I downloaded Ant and added ant.jar to my application, but my code wouldn't run because the org.apache.tools.ant.launch package in the ant.jar file is EMPTY!\n\nThis package is supposed to contain the AntMain, Launcher and Locator classes among others. The package is certainly there, but it contains no classes.\n\nI tried using the ant.jar files that came with various installations of Glassfish, Eclipse and Netbeans, but they all suffer from exactly the same problem!\n\nI finally solved the problem by installing LeafCutter which carries the missing ant classes.\n\n\nChris Hand."}, {"count": 1, "text": "Problem solved by adding ant-launcher.jar to the project build path.", "bug_id": 49380, "is_private": false, "id": 137347, "time": "2010-06-04T05:47:39Z", "creator": "chris.hand@live.co.uk", "creation_time": "2010-06-04T05:47:39Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49380, "attachment_id": null, "id": 137370, "time": "2010-06-05T03:23:18Z", "creator": "jkf@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-06-05T03:23:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "as indicated by submitter these are in ant-launcher.jar"}]
