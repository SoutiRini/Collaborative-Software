[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38177, "text": "1) On 11/13/04, per the recommendation on the Apache website, I submitted\n   the following question/bug report/patch regarding a possible problem\n   with the mod_log_forensic module's use of assert() vs. ap_assert()\n   under Solaris to the \"apache-httpd-users\" mailing list (it causes\n   a \"mod_log_forensic.so: symbol __eprintf: referenced symbol not found\"\n   error when attempting to run \"httpd\"):\n\n   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-users&m=110039542317294&w=2\n\n\n   On 11/14/04, Joshua Slive recommended I instead submit this report to\n   \"apache-httpd-dev\" mailing list or the Apache bugs database:\n\n   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-users&m=110045679622830&w=2\n\n\n2) On 11/14/04, Jim Jagielski replied to this issue on the apache-httpd-dev\n   mailing list and also proposed a more formal patch for the problem:\n\n   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=110045758526041&w=2\n   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=110045807628303&w=2\n\n\n3) Jeff Trawick submitted a \"+1\" reply to Jim Jagielski's proposed patch\n   on 11/14/04 and so did Andre Malo on 11/15/04:\n\n   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=110045945314944&w=2\n   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=110051618628764&w=2\n\n\n   Since I did not see any follow-up negative responses to Jim Jagielski's\n   proposed patch, I had assumed that discussing this problem on the\n   developer's mailing list meant it would be included in the next\n   apache-1.3.x release?\n\n\n4) On 01/08/06, I compiled the latest apache-1.3.34 version (released on\n   10/18/05) and I see that this issue with the mod_log_forensic.c file\n   still exists so apparently this minor patch from almost a year ago\n   apparently did not make it into the apache-1.3.x release cycle.\n\n   I'm now submitting this bug report to request that it be committed\n   for inclusion in the next apache-1.3.x release (whenever that occurs).\n\n\nThank you!", "count": 0, "id": 84334, "time": "2006-01-08T08:44:40Z", "creator": "wcheung@ucsd.edu", "creation_time": "2006-01-08T08:44:40Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Committed to the 1.3.x branch in r367914.
