If I am working on a U.S. English system, \nbut attempting to target the German translation, I may end up getting English \nstrings in my final output, because the Translate task always tries to load \nstrings for the system default locale in addition to the locale specified in \nthe task attributes.\n\nSpecifically, if I add a new string key to the source HTML file, and add the \nkey to the U.S. English property file, but forget to add the key to the German \nproperty file, the task will succeed, inserting English into the German HTML \npage. I don't think this is ever the right behavior. I'd rather have the task \nfail -- automatically detecting the problem instead of requiring visual \ninspection of the final HTML.\n\nIn the case where a string should be used for all locales, it should go in the \nbase bundle property file.\n\nIf there really is a situation where you always want the default locale, maybe \nan attribute could be added to override that behavior, with a default value to \npreserve backward compatibility."}]
