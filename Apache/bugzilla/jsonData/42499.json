For example:\nNot Found\nThe requested URL /DE/d:(^|;)\\w{7}(;|:$)/o:-DE;US;-US was not found on\nthis server.\n\nThe URL is not handed off to mod_rewrite (As I would think it should be) to be\nprocessed by my rewrite rules.  Setting AllowEncodedSlashes causes apache to\nconvert the backslash(es) to forward slashes, which is not what I want.\n\nMy band aid solution to this is to set\nErrorDocument 404 \"/search.php\"\nand then in search.php append the third line (the first two already being standard):\n$path_info = @$_SERVER['ORIG_PATH_INFO'];\nif (!$path_info) $path_info = @$_SERVER['PATH_INFO'];\nif (($ru=$_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL']) && !$path_info) $path_info = $ru;\n\nStill this solution is cumbersome and not very nice.  Shouldn't apache wait\nuntil the rewrite rules can't deal with the original URL to issue the error?\n\nCsaba Gabor from Vienna\n\nThis issue originally described at:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/alt.apache.configuration/browse_frm/thread/1ba63c9cc8036a05/44217cdf290612c6"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42499, "attachment_id": null, "text": "allowencodedslashes", "id": 149410, "time": "2011-09-17T17:19:11Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-09-17T17:19:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42499, "text": "http://188.64.218.136/sad/sad/sad/dfsdfsdfsd.htm do 404 error by ErrorDocument 404 /FreeModules/404.php.\n\nhttp://188.64.218.136/sad\\sad do simple text error \"Not Found The requested URL /sad\\sad was not found on this server.\".
