By default name is not changed, but it is possible to configure automatic change in jmeter.properties\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nI use JMeter a lot and Module Controller also, and I found it very convinient that name of Module Controller is automatically changed to a referenced module. When the name was not automatically changed I had a lot of elements named Module Controller and there was quite a lot of write/copy/paste/etc. work to name module controller elements (as almost always I changed it to a referenced element name)\n\nMany thanks", "id": 181125, "time": "2015-02-18T07:54:43Z", "creator": "maciej.franek@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-02-18T07:54:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57561, "text": "Hi,\nWhat about instead of a new global property , add a checkbox that would be component property in GUI to enable or disable this behaviour ?\n\nRegards\n@ubikloadpack", "id": 181170, "time": "2015-02-19T10:47:46Z", "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "creation_time": "2015-02-19T10:47:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 7, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "maciej.franek@gmail.com", "text": "Hi,\n\nOk for me, but still I would add global property to define if this checkbox is enabled/disabled by default\n\nRegards,\nMaciej Franek", "id": 181206, "time": "2015-02-20T08:52:35Z", "bug_id": 57561, "creation_time": "2015-02-20T08:52:35Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "text": "(In reply to maciej.franek from comment #7)\n> Hi,\n> \n> Ok for me, but still I would add global property to define if this checkbox\n> is enabled/disabled by default\n> \n> Regards,\n> Maciej Franek\n\nI suggest you discuss this on dev mailing list so that all team developers give their opinion to see if your patch would be accepted.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 181212, "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "time": "2015-02-20T10:09:31Z", "bug_id": 57561, "creation_time": "2015-02-20T10:09:31Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 9, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "maciej.franek@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 182805, "time": "2015-05-02T15:10:34Z", "bug_id": 57561, "creation_time": "2015-05-02T15:10:34Z", "tags": [], "text": "After discussing on dev mailing list I`ve prepared new version of Module Controller UI that contains two new fields:\n\n1.
