Both OS (IIS) can load 64bits connector, but fail with 32bits connector.\n\nReproduce steps:\nIn Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition SP2, IIS works in 64bits mode, the connector can be properly loaded. \nThen run the command to make IIS work in wow64 mode:\ncscript.exe %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\inetpub\\adminscripts\\adsutil.vbs SET W3SVC/AppPools/Enable32bitAppOnWin64 1\nRestart server and configure 32bits tomcat connector, it cannot be successfully loaded.\n\nIn Windows Server 2008R2, make the website use 32bit application pool and then configure 32bits tomcat connector, it failed to be loaded. Same as 2003 x64 Edition 64bits IIS mode, 64bits tomcat connector can be successfully loaded."}]
