[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46462, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi,\n\nJSPWiki is currently an Incubator project at Apache. We intend to use the package name org.apache.jspwiki. However, any classes in this package tree fail to load when imported into a JSP page, specifically during Jasper's attempt to compile it.\n\nFor example, \n\n<%@ page import=\"org.apache.jspwiki.WikiPage\" %>\n \ndoes not compile. My colleague Harry Metske traced the cause to this line in org.apache.jasper.servlet.JasperLoader:\n\n\n\n        if( !name.startsWith(Constants.JSP_PACKAGE_NAME) ) {\n            // Class is not in org.apache.jsp, therefore, have our\n            // parent load it\n            clazz = parent.loadClass(name);            \n            if( resolve )\n                resolveClass(clazz);\n            return clazz;\n        }\n\nThe recommended bug fix would be to append a period (\".\") to the expression passed into name.startsWith(), which in this case would then evaluate to \"org.apache.jsp.\", and allow JSPWiki classes to load and compile.\n\nThis issue is important for us as we emerge from incubation. Lack of a fix means that JSPWiki cannot release under the desired package name \"org.apache.jspwiki.\"\n\nSee additional commentary in the Apache JIRA database here: \nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-464", "id": 123683, "time": "2009-01-01T20:29:15Z", "creator": "ajaquith@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-01-01T20:29:15Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46462, "text": "This has been fixed in trunk and proposed for 6.0.x. providing it gets two more +1 votes it will be included in 6.0.19 onwards.", "id": 123689, "time": "2009-01-02T03:10:31Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-01-02T03:10:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46462, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I created a new separate JIRA issue for JSPWiki:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-465", "id": 123691, "time": "2009-01-02T03:52:38Z", "creator": "harry.metske@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-01-02T03:52:38Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46462, "attachment_id": null, "id": 124059, "time": "2009-01-14T16:22:56Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-01-14T16:22:56Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This has been fixed in 6.0.x and will be included in 6.0.19 onwards."}]
