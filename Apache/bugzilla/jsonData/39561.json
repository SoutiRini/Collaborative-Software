The default\nvalue centers the content so that it touches the edge of the given area in\none dimension and leave blank space at the top and bottom.\n\n   You then streatch the 1x1 box to the 'proper' aspect ratio but\nsince Batik correctly avoided distorting the image when fitting it\nto the 1x1 box your scaling transform now squishes it (in Adobe it\n'undoes' the horizontal squish used to fit the image to the 1x1 box).\n\n   The short answer of what to do is add:\n      preserveAspectRatio=\"none\"\n   to your image element,  you might also think about just sizing\nthe image element correctly since you obviously know the desired size...\n", "id": 89080, "time": "2006-05-12T20:46:05Z", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-05-12T20:46:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39561, "attachment_id": null, "id": 156577, "time": "2012-04-01T13:50:03Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:50:03Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs"}]
