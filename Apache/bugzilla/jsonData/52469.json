Currently, the port is randomly assigned, which makes it tricky to tunnel traffic to that port over a SSH tunnel.\n\n2) The current behavior of RemoteJMeterEngineImpl is to throw an exception if the remote engine attempts to listen to traffic over the loopback interface.  However, we often need this behavior when tunneling RMI traffic over an SSH tunnel as the remote endpoint will actually be a port on the local machine, which is subsequently tunneled.  To support this functionality, I propose allowing the localhost loopback interface to be used if it has been specified directly using the \"java.rmi.server.hostname\" parameter.  Thus, we keep the current default behavior of warning the user if their remote endpoint is only listening on the local interface, but allowing users who know what they are doing to specify the local interface if they really want to."}, {"text": "Applied with minor modifications:\n- changes.xml\n- new property added to jmeter.properties with comment\n\n\nThanks for the patch.\n\nDate: Sun Jan 15 14:11:54 2012\nNew Revision: 1231671\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1231671&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 52469 - Changes in Support of SSH-Tunneling of RMI traffic for Remote Testing\n\nModified:\n   jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/engine/RemoteJMeterEngineImpl.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/RemoteSampleListenerImpl.java\n   jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n\nDate: Sun Jan 15 14:13:34 2012\nNew Revision: 1231672\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1231672&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 52469 - Changes in Support of SSH-Tunneling of RMI traffic for Remote Testing\n\nModified:\n   jmeter/trunk/bin/jmeter.properties", "tags": [], "bug_id": 52469, "attachment_id": null, "count": 1, "id": 152803, "time": "2012-01-15T14:14:09Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-15T14:14:09Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 152806, "time": "2012-01-15T15:37:38Z", "bug_id": 52469, "creation_time": "2012-01-15T15:37:38Z", "text": "Date: Sun Jan 15 15:36:52 2012\nNew Revision: 1231689\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1231689&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 52469 - Changes in Support of SSH-Tunneling of RMI traffic for Remote Testing\n\nModified:\n   jmeter/trunk/xdocs/usermanual/remote-test.xml"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 153013, "time": "2012-01-22T15:57:52Z", "bug_id": 52469, "creation_time": "2012-01-22T15:57:52Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 48016 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}]
