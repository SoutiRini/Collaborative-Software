However it does not make any sense to apply the same check for property names as they might well match reserved Java keywords, such as 'class', 'int', double', etc. In the example above I am trying to get a value returned java.lang.Exception#getClass(), which is not possible because of the check in question.\n\nAccording to bug #49217 it has been fixed in Tomcat 6.0.x but I still seem to be getting the same problem in 7.0.4. \n\nThanks,\nEldar", "id": 144632, "time": "2011-03-01T12:53:23Z", "bug_id": 50850, "creation_time": "2011-03-01T12:53:23Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50850, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 144633, "time": "2011-03-01T13:36:54Z", "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-03-01T13:36:54Z", "text": "1.
