At least well-known cases should be handled (-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=...).\n\nPossible remedies:\n* Provide an option to not log command line args (but the other information).\n* Handle well-known cases via a blacklist of substrings / regex that prevent logging (\"javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword\", or \"password\" and \"secret\" in general).\n\nOr course, removing the listener also works, but at the price of removing *all* of its logging.", "id": 198849, "time": "2017-05-22T14:16:28Z", "creator": "juergen.hermann@1und1.de", "creation_time": "2017-05-22T14:16:28Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "1.
