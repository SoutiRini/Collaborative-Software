It correctly handles every \nEnglish-language nuance that I have been able to think of. It adds fields to \neach FOText object that point to previous & next FOText objects within the same \nBlock, so that the text in related FOText objects can be considered for needed \ncontext. It then transforms the text as part of the FOText Constructor. Some of \nthe fields and methods added may be useful for other parts of FOP as well. This \ncode assumes that words do not span multiple blocks.\n\nCaveat: I cannot think of any, but if there are cases (now or in the future)\nwhere FOText objects do not have ancestor Block objects, text-transform will \nnot be able to consider other FOText objects for context. This can be fixed by \nstoring the Block-like ancestor instead.\n\nCaveat: The definition of \"word\" for purposes of this property is ambiguous. It \nmay need to be tweaked over time, especially for scripts other than Latin. I \nhave tried to build an infrastructure that will allow such modifications to be \npretty easily implemented.\n\nVictor Mote (vic@outfitr.com)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14057, "attachment_id": 3650, "text": "Created attachment 3650\npatch file for text-transform logic (maintenance branch)", "id": 25332, "time": "2002-10-29T18:36:24Z", "creator": "vic@outfitr.com", "creation_time": "2002-10-29T18:36:24Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "vic@outfitr.com", "attachment_id": 3651, "id": 25333, "time": "2002-10-29T18:37:32Z", "bug_id": 14057, "creation_time": "2002-10-29T18:37:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 3651\nxsl-fo document for testing features of text-transform"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "vic@outfitr.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 25621, "time": "2002-11-04T15:37:00Z", "bug_id": 14057, "creation_time": "2002-11-04T15:37:00Z", "is_private": false, "text": "As discussed on dev mailing list, we will not do this work in the maintenance \nbranch.
