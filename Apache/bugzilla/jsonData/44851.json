I'm honestly a little surprised by the lack of benchmarkers out there that output in a machine parsable format.  'ab' is pretty ubiquitous, but we needed DELETE and PUT in addition to GET/HEAD/POST.\n\nThis small patch represents about 15 minutes of pokin' at it.  It seems to do the right thing.  Taken from a 2.2.8-stable tarball.\n\nI tried to keep it within the existing code style.  Comments welcome.\n\nI'd appreciate your consideration with committing this to the core codebase -- it'd be great to round out ApacheBench's RESTy verbs a bit.", "id": 115761, "time": "2008-04-21T22:49:19Z", "bug_id": 44851, "creation_time": "2008-04-21T22:49:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mahlon@martini.nu", "attachment_id": 21845, "text": "Created attachment 21845\nApacheBench PUT and DELETE patch, take 2\n\nMinor change:  'posting' variable was arguably overloaded before (not just a boolean, but -1 for HEAD, 0 for GET, and 1 for POST) -- just renamed it to 'method', but kept numerical mapping logic:\n\n-2 DELETE\n-1 HEAD\n0 GET\n1 POST\n2 PUT\n\n'posting' implied a boolean (is this a posting request?) before, I think 'method' is a little more readable.", "id": 115772, "time": "2008-04-22T07:23:04Z", "bug_id": 44851, "creation_time": "2008-04-22T07:23:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "mahlon@martini.nu", "text": "Updated patch against ApacheBench 2.3, which shipped with Apache 2.2.9-stable.", "count": 2, "id": 117845, "time": "2008-06-19T22:50:25Z", "bug_id": 44851, "creation_time": "2008-06-19T22:50:25Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44851, "text": "Created attachment 22150\nApacheBench PUT and DELETE patch (Apache 2.2.9 AB 2.3)", "id": 117846, "time": "2008-06-19T22:51:26Z", "creator": "mahlon@martini.nu", "creation_time": "2008-06-19T22:51:26Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 22150}, {"count": 4, "text": "change from 56604 was merged to trunk, and covers requirements from this ticket also\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 56604 ***", "creator": "winfinit@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 175728, "time": "2014-06-07T16:39:39Z", "bug_id": 44851, "creation_time": "2014-06-07T16:39:39Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
