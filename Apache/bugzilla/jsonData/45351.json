There are two issues here, but as long as we don't succeed in isolating them, there is no need for two reports.\n\nThe first one seems to be related to the white-space (which, as I understand, is common to precede a question-mark in French typesetting?). It does not matter whether it is a regular space or another type. The elements generated by the spaces appear to confuse the algorithm if hyphenation is added. (known issue with preserved white-space and linefeeds: see Bugzilla #38264)\n\nThe second seems to be strictly related to hyphenation, as changing the language makes the problem go away...
