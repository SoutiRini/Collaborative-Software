However, when accessed through http://server/subdir//index.shtml (with an extra slash), it will instead include DOCUMENT_ROOT/subdir/file.shtml!  This leads to \u201c[an error occurred while processing this directive]\u201d if the latter file doesn\u2019t exist, or the wrong file being included if it does.  (One could perhaps imagine this leading to an information disclosure vulnerability in contrived cases.)\n\nThis problem exists as far back as 2.0.40, but it doesn\u2019t seem to exist on a 1.3.x server (that isn\u2019t mine, so I can\u2019t say for sure)."}]
