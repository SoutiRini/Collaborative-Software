I still hope that an updated version of commons-dbcp is released at some time before Tomcat 8, so that using patch tool were not necessary.\n\n2. As an alternative measure, it is possible to skip building DBCP.\nTechnically, it can be done by setting the property \"no.build.dbcp\", though it is kind of a trick, as it is an internal property used to store result of a <condition>. E.g.:\n\nno.build.dbcp=true\n\n(It would be better to have some explicit documented property to configure this feature. Such as that it would skip not only building, but also downloading DBCP sources)."}, {"count": 4, "text": "Created attachment 29925\nBUILDING.txt patch\n\nCheckstyle errors fixed.", "bug_id": 54522, "attachment_id": 29925, "id": 165100, "time": "2013-02-06T11:54:09Z", "creator": "ognjen.d.blagojevic@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-02-06T11:54:09Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "This has been fixed by switching to (a snapshot of) DBCP2 which implemented JDBC 4.1 so has no need of any patching.", "id": 169023, "time": "2013-08-01T19:52:58Z", "bug_id": 54522, "creation_time": "2013-08-01T19:52:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "ognjen.d.blagojevic@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thank you.", "id": 169971, "time": "2013-09-09T07:32:47Z", "bug_id": 54522, "creation_time": "2013-09-09T07:32:47Z", "is_private": false}]
