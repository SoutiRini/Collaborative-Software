If you wish to have LDAP users,\nedit the file ac.xconf and uncomment the LDAPUser line. Restart your servlet\ncontainer, in the admin/users area, there should now appear a button to add\nLDAP users.\n\nNote: configuration of the LDAP properties is not yet handled within the\nac.xconf, it is still in the \"classic\" ldap.properties file as in the unizh\npublication. Once this patch is integrated, we could then work on \nintegrating the LDAP properties themselves within ac.xconf."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30231, "text": "Created attachment 12179\nthe files required for this patch (Java, xsp, etc.)", "id": 60905, "time": "2004-07-21T13:31:36Z", "creator": "jwkaltz@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-07-21T13:31:36Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 12179}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jwkaltz@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 60906, "time": "2004-07-21T13:35:16Z", "bug_id": 30231, "creation_time": "2004-07-21T13:35:16Z", "is_private": false, "text": "(sorry for the noise ... this interface is new to me)\n\nthe attachment mentioned in the previous comment is a .tar.gz file. \nUnfortunately the file name seems to get lost when uploading.\n"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30231, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Added lenya-dev@cocoon.apache.org to CC-list.", "id": 60908, "time": "2004-07-21T14:29:42Z", "creator": "A.Kuckartz@ping.de", "creation_time": "2004-07-21T14:29:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "I just applied the patch and did not had problems besides with to files:\n- UserType.java.diff (no patch format)\n- UserManager.java.diff (no match)\n\nCan you please fix this files and add them in another attachment?", "is_private": false, "id": 61077, "creator": "thorsten@apache.org", "time": "2004-07-24T10:31:36Z", "bug_id": 30231, "creation_time": "2004-07-24T10:31:36Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30231, "attachment_id": null, "id": 61116, "time": "2004-07-26T07:30:52Z", "creator": "jwkaltz@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-07-26T07:30:52Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Hi Thorsten & all\n- the file UserType.java.diff would represent a new file.
