Obviously\nyour DirctoryIndex includes index.html, and when apache tries to grab\nthat file, it follows the redirect you have setup for that file.  That\ndoesn't seem like unexpected behavior to me.\n\nIf what you want is to redirect direct requests for index.html but\nprovide a directory listing on other requests for that directory,\nthen simply change the DirectoryIndex for that directory.\n\nAnd in the future, please bring up questions like this on a user-support\nforum like the users@httpd.apache.org list.  Then you can at least refine\nyour bug report a little before you submit it.\n\nThanks for using Apache.", "id": 53029, "time": "2004-02-26T16:30:33Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-02-26T16:30:33Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
