It could have been \ncaught early on and solved by people who know the code better \nthan I do :) \n\nMany Thanks in advance from all of us Apache users and develoeprs\nwho use content-negotation.\n\n-jose\n\n[1] http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41960", "id": 106384, "time": "2007-08-06T08:02:37Z", "bug_id": 43044, "creation_time": "2007-08-06T08:02:37Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43044, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Patches welcome.

Following initial feedback from you, I submitted \na patch there and have no idea when the Apache team will review it.\n\nThis bug could have been previously detected following that or a similar simple \ntest scenario.  I'd would be glad to submit a patch for your test suite so that \nthis cases can be part of them in the future. However, I've no idea what kind \nof test suite you use for testing the Apache server. It doesn't seem to be \nrelated to the test subdirectory.\n\nIf you could give more pointers to code and documentation to your QA test \nsuite, I'd be more than happy to contribute new code for these tests. It would\nsave me more time if they would be tested before each release. Meanwhile, the \nmost I can do is to point out the lack of content negotiation testing that has \ngiven arise to these bugs.\n\nCheers,\n\n-jose"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 106407, "time": "2007-08-06T13:25:18Z", "bug_id": 43044, "creation_time": "2007-08-06T13:25:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please see\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/test/\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/trunk/perl-framework"}]
