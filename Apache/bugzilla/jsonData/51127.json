In 2.2, this directive doesn't work like ProxyPassReverse. Given this directive:\n\nProxyPassReverseCookiePath / /apps/\n\nI would expect that if the backend creates a cookie with path /example, the directive would rewrite it to /apps/example. Instead, it is written to /apps/ on the proxy.\n\nIf my backend had a bunch of apps with different paths (/app1 /app2 /app3 etc) and each wanted a separate cookie, I'd need a separate directive for each.\n\nI expect this change might break some < 2.3 configurations, but at least it could go in trunk for the next major release."}]
