[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25738, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Our development team recently upgraded from tomcat 4.0.6 to 4.1.27 which has \ntag pooling enabled by default.  We all agree tag pooling is a good thing, \nhowever we had several jsps which would break when tag pooling is enabled.  \nWe've solved the problem by disabled tag pooling under \n$CATALINA_HOME/config/web.xml.  Our longer term plan is to fix all our jsps, \nbut in the meantime we have to work around this.\n\nUnfortunately we had been using the \"jspc\" Ant task to precompile our .jsp \nfiles to improve initial access time in production environments.  I've read all \nthe warnings and understand the reasoning against this, but our traffic is just \ntoo high to avoid it.  As a result of using the JspC command to \nprecompile .jsps, I've found there is no way to disable tag pooling from a \ncommand line argument.  \n\nin the JspC.java class there's even a public method:\n\npublic boolean isPoolingEnabled() {\n    return true;\n}\n\nIs that just a to-do item, or is there some significant reason that can't be \nset by a main() argument?\n\nIf this is just something that's yet to be done, I'll happily make the change \nmyself.  In any case, jasper's getting a lot of testing in our shop.\n\nThanks.", "id": 49648, "time": "2003-12-23T22:55:21Z", "creator": "sean@yunt.net", "creation_time": "2003-12-23T22:55:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "This wasn't fixed in 4.1.x but it has been fixed in 5.5.x, 6.0.x and 7.0.x", "id": 138192, "time": "2010-07-05T18:01:24Z", "bug_id": 25738, "creation_time": "2010-07-05T18:01:24Z", "attachment_id": null}]
