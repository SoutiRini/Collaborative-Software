When sending files to the server using RFC1867 multi-part post method, \nthe upload is terminated when the overall upload time is longer than the value \nset in the timeout directive.  I believe this is an incorrect behavior.  \nAccording to the documentation (see above), I believe that the upload should \nonly be terminated if the time-between-packets is longer than the timeout \nvalue.
