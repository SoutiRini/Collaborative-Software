So if there is a discrepancy, it's a real bug.\n\nFrom what I understand, you are saying that presence of cells in one row can affect the LastCellNum value of another row.  POI didn't seem to have any test case which made sure this doesn't occur, this so I added one (in svn r655912).\n\nCan you please upload a spreadsheet and/or some test code which shows the behaviour you are referring to?\n"}]
