[{"count": 0, "text": "Hello.\n\nI am using mod_proxy and mod_auth together and got a tomcat 4.1.31 and 5.5.12\nand 5.5.17, doesnt matter which tomcat version i use to test this behaviour.\n\nI've configured mod_proxy to pass /error to localhost:8080/error, ProxyPass\n/error http://localhost:8080/error, to let tomcat handlet the error pages,\ndefined later.\nWorks fine so far.\n\nBut now i get a path, which wont get proxy'ed and mentioned ProxyPass /awstats ! .\nThis path is also secured by mod_auth, using AuthType Basic.\n\nAuth is working fine, it tomcat doesnt run or /error isnt mentioned to be proxied.\n\nIf tomcat is running, like it should be, and /error will be proxied, mod_auth\ndoesnt work anymore.\nInstead of seeing the popup from browser for credentials when browsing /awstats,\ni only see a white page.\n\nLooking at http headers it shows, that a 404 is responsed from apache-coyote,\nbut /awstats should not get be proxied - if tomcat doesnt run, apache responses\nand all works again.\n\nRenaming /error to ProxyPass /errorpages http://localhost:8080/error and doing\nan Alias /error /errorpages works fine.\nBut doing a ProxyPass on /error directly, doesnt work.\n\nconclusion:\n\nproxypass /error leaves Locations which wont get proxypasswd but answered by\napache and which are secured with mod_auth unreachable, renaming the /error path\nto something else and doing and alias on this renamed path, works.\nIt also works if tomcat is stopped and only apache is running ( although all\ndefined errorpages wont work, but the auth location works now ).\n\nIs this fine behaviour or a bug? Any hints what i can try? I read documentation\nto mod_proxy and mod_auth, there is no part that's saying that i shouldnt do a\nproxypass in /error.\n\nkind regards\n\nTorsten", "bug_id": 39851, "is_private": false, "id": 90443, "time": "2006-06-21T14:46:23Z", "creator": "tkrah@fachschaft.imn.htwk-leipzig.de", "creation_time": "2006-06-21T14:46:23Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39851, "attachment_id": null, "id": 90449, "time": "2006-06-21T21:20:53Z", "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-06-21T21:20:53Z", "is_private": false, "text": "To ease analysis could you please post the complete working and the complete non\nworking configuration?"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "tkrah@fachschaft.imn.htwk-leipzig.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 90478, "time": "2006-06-22T08:42:22Z", "bug_id": 39851, "creation_time": "2006-06-22T08:42:22Z", "text": "Sorry - my fault, testing further it shows, that if no 401 document is found at\n/error proxied location, a 404 is given and the auth request is left broken.\n\nThere has to be a 401 document declared ( any file you want ) - then proxypass\n/error works, the only mystic thing i wonder is, if /error is only an Alias, it\nworks - whether a 401 document is declared or not, strange.\n\nkind regards\n\nTorsten"}]
