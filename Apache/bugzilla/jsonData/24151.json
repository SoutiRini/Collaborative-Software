It does \nnot display that page, rather it shows the directories under the DocumentRoot.\n\nI am using Tomcat 4.1.27 as the WebContainer, which is connected to Apache via \nmod_jk.so/dll.\n\nMy configuration is as follows : \n\nDocumentRoot C:\\Projects\\STK11\n\n<Directory \"C:\\Projects\\STK11\">\n\nDirectoryIndex jsp/Login.jsp \n\nI got the directories under STK11, instead of Login.jsp. DirectoryIndex \nas /jsp/Login.jsp, also has the same problem.\n\nIn addition to these, I have configurations with respect to mod_jk, which is \nsimply an \"Include\" statment. \n\nI have precompiled classes in \"WEB-INF\" directory, where I have the compiled \nLogin.jsp file.\n\nNote:\n\n1.If I am putting a html page as the directory index, it displays the page \nindependent of the location(though still relative to DocumentRoot.)\n\n2. If Login.jsp is put in the DocumentRoot (in addition to under \n<DocumentRoot>\\jsp directory), I am able to see the Login.jsp page!!!\n\n3. If \"/jsp/<SPACE>/Login.jsp\" is given, although this page comes, it takes a \nlot of time to load. Hence I think, it is not taking the precompiled classes.\n\nThis issue happens in all the platforms, Windows, SOLARIS, LINUX."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24151, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This should have been posted to the tomcat-user mailing list.", "id": 68847, "time": "2004-12-22T21:48:35Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-12-22T21:48:35Z", "is_private": false}]
