As the files I want to parse contain tags\nof the form <prefix:tagName> the parser calls the\nParseEventListener.getTagLibraries() method.\n\nIf I wanted to handle the tags as custom tags I would have to return a\nTagLibraries object. If I wouldn't want to, I might return null. Both solutions\npresent problems :\n\n(1) Returning a new TagLibraries object is not possible, because the constructor\nis not accessible outside the org.apache.jasper.compiler package. Maybe the\nconstructor should be made public ?\n\n(2) Returning null from ParseEventListener.getTagLibraries() will throw a\nNullPointerException because accepting the custom tags in Parser.Tag.accept()\ndoes not check for null TagLibraries. A fixing solution might be to check for\nnull results.\n\nLooking at the possibilities I would suggest to fix the TagLibraries class to\ndeclare the constructor public (I checked tomcat-3.2.2-b1, tomcat-3.3-m2 as well\nas the nightly builds of tomcat-3.x and tomcat-4.0-dev. Ann all still contain\nthe same code in that respect).\n\nThank you very much !\n\nFelix Meschberger\nDevelopment, Day Management\nBasle, Switzerland", "id": 1546, "time": "2001-03-22T00:31:41Z", "bug_id": 1077, "creation_time": "2001-03-22T00:31:41Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1077, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 1569, "time": "2001-03-23T02:28:35Z", "creator": "Felix.Meschberger@daynetwork.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-23T02:28:35Z", "text": "Sorry for the inconvenience.
