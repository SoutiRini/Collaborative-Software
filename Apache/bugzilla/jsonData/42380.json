[{"count": 0, "text": "Here is a fun thing with fop:\n\nI have an application that gets run from the command line (no app server). It\ncurrently uses 'java -cp\njar1.har:jar2.jar:fop.jar:xmlgraphics-common.jar:batik.jar Mainclass' \n\nThis works fine, the app loads and runs.\n\nNow we decided to switch the application to be run directly from a jar using the\nClass-Path: manifest attribute to execute. This means, that the Mainclass is now\nin the main.jar and contains a manifest like this:\n\nMain-Class: Mainclass\nClass-Path: ../lib/jar1.jar ../lib/jar2.jar ../lib/fop.jar \n ../lib/xmlgraphics-common.jar ../lib/fop.jar\n\nThe \"../lib\" is the relative path from the main.jar to the dependency libs. We\nalso index the jar and its classpath using the <indexjars> element of the ant\njar task.\n\nNow the application can be run with \"java -jar main.jar\"\n\nAll this works well, the dependencies are found, etc. However, as soon as the\nPDF should get rendered, it reports the dreaded 'don't know how to handle\napplication/pdf' exception.\n\nIt seems that the Service class inside xmlgraphics-commons is not able to load\nits settings if an application is packaged in this way.", "creator": "hps@intermeta.de", "attachment_id": null, "id": 103036, "time": "2007-05-10T06:42:56Z", "bug_id": 42380, "creation_time": "2007-05-10T06:42:56Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42380, "attachment_id": null, "id": 157390, "time": "2012-04-07T01:42:17Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:42:17Z", "is_private": false, "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review"}]
