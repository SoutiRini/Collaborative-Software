[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "According to http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ext/basics/download.html\nMultiple Class-Path entries in the manifest are allowed.\nIn 1.4.1 (haven't tried 1.5b2 yet) doing\n<manifest>\n  <attribute name=\"Class-Path\" value=\"somejar.jar\"/>\n  <attribute name=\"Class-Path\" value=\"anotherjar.jar\"/>\n</manifest>\nin the <jar> task throws an error claiming that only one Class-Path per manifest\nis allowed.  I couldn't find a reference to this limitation in the Manifest\nspec, but the tutorial says it's ok.\n\nThe error is generated when ant runs.\n\nIt would be really nice if the jar task had a lib sub-task like the war task\nthat would place all jars in the META-INF/lib dir then include the entries in\nthe Manifest.mf.\n\nAlso the lib sub-task in war does not add entries to the manifest.mf in the war,\ndon't know if this was spec or not, but the inconsistent behavior is confusing\nand should at least be documented in the Ant docs.\n\nThanks,\nCurt", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 10063, "id": 18198, "time": "2002-06-20T15:57:29Z", "creator": "cjohnson@arrayservices.com", "creation_time": "2002-06-20T15:57:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "1.4.1 didn't allow it apparently - 1.5b2 does.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 10063, "id": 18204, "time": "2002-06-20T17:29:01Z", "creator": "apache@graemlin.net", "creation_time": "2002-06-20T17:29:01Z", "is_private": false}]
