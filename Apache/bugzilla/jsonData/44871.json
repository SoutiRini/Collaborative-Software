[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44871, "is_private": false, "text": "We've discovered an issue with the latest version of Tomcat 5 (5.5.25) & Tomcat 6 (6.0.16). The problem arises when doing base64 encoding of cookies in our application. When the cookie is encoded, the '=' character is used for padding. When it reaches the browser, the cookie is a valid base 64 encoded cookie and the '=' character is the last character.\n\nHowever when the application retrieves the cookies sent back from the browser using a simple request.getCookie, we can see that the '=' char has been stripped away. This results in a an error when trying to decode. It could be as a result of the '=' being used as a delimiting character resulting in the request headers being incorrectly parsed.\n\nThis is only an issues with the latest versions of Tomcat 5 & 6. Previous version work ok.", "id": 115856, "time": "2008-04-24T13:15:17Z", "creator": "michael.a.moynihan@fmr.com", "creation_time": "2008-04-24T13:15:17Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 115857, "time": "2008-04-24T14:33:12Z", "bug_id": 44871, "creation_time": "2008-04-24T14:33:12Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 44679 ***"}]
