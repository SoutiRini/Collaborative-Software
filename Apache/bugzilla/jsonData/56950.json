We've been running this patch in FreeSWITCH's version of APR for years and would like to see it included upstream if possible.  Please let us know your thoughts and if any changes are appropriate we'll be happy to make them and propose a revised patch.\n\nThe patch series being proposed here is also available on the master branch of this repository:\n\n  https://github.com/traviscross/apr/\n\nAuthor: Anthony Minessale <anthm@freeswitch.org>\nDate:   Tue Aug 27 13:59:24 2013 -0400\n\n    Return success if socket is already closed\n    \n    Prior to this commit, socket_cleanup would return an error if the\n    socket had already been closed.  With this commit we return success\n    instead.\n    \n    This is useful, for example, if a socket is closed manually and we\n    then try to close it again as part of the cleanup of a pool.\n    \n    Signed-off-by: Anthony Minessale <anthm@freeswitch.org>\n    Signed-off-by: Travis Cross <tc@traviscross.com>", "is_private": false, "id": 177711, "creation_time": "2014-09-10T18:52:56Z", "time": "2014-09-10T18:52:56Z", "creator": "tc+asf@travislists.com", "bug_id": 56950, "attachment_id": 31991}]
