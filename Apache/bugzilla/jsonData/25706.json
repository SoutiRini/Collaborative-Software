[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25706, "text": "[PATCH] I have been a bit too general in my previous patch (bug\n25031), where I add bp to vecInlineBreaks if prevBP == null. In a\nnumber of cases (!bBreakOK) it has been added already. Now I have\nmoved this action to the three places where the routine breaks out of\nthe loop because bp is over the line length. The effect of the\naction is to accept bp even though it is over the line length when\nthis is the first BP on the line (prevBP == null).", "id": 49554, "time": "2003-12-22T18:16:05Z", "creator": "spepping@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-12-22T18:16:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 9667\nThe patch as described", "is_private": false, "id": 49555, "creator": "spepping@apache.org", "time": "2003-12-22T18:17:31Z", "bug_id": 25706, "creation_time": "2003-12-22T18:17:31Z", "attachment_id": 9667}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25706, "attachment_id": null, "id": 49633, "time": "2003-12-23T20:42:20Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-12-23T20:42:20Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Applied.
