For example, errors=0, sessions=0, requests=0, etc. All stats are reset to their initial values (usually 0).\n\nIt would be nice to be able to reset a specific value and not the others. For example, reset errors=0 but leave request/session counts, byte counters, etc. all at their current values.\n\nThe current URL for resetting worker stats is:\n\n/jk-status?cmd=reset&w=[worker]&sw=[subworker]\n\nI suggest adding another optional parameter \"s\" (for \"stat\") whose value can be any of:\n\n  Acc\n  Sess\n  Err\n  CE\n  RE\n  Wr\n  Rd\n  MaxBusy\n  MaxCon\n  Rs (?)\n  LR (?)\n  LE\n\n...or a comma-separated list of any of those values. (These values match the shorthand names for the various mod_jk worker stats). Alternatively, multiple \"s\" parameters could be processed instead of a single comma-separated list of stats."}]
