[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi all\n\nI have an Apache trying to ProxyPass some location to another Apache.\nThe frontend one listens on https, the backend one on http.\nIn case the backend sends 301 I can rewrite the host address using ProxyPreserveHost On.\nThe browser then tries to connect with the protocol the backend has set in the redirect, which fails of course. I didn't find any way around this. So I propose that ProxyPreserveHost should also care about the protocol.\n\nI would prepare some patch if you agree.\n\nGreetings\nJohannes M\u00fcller", "is_private": false, "id": 142039, "creator": "joh_m@gmx.de", "time": "2010-11-26T12:03:28Z", "bug_id": 50344, "creation_time": "2010-11-26T12:03:28Z", "attachment_id": null}]
