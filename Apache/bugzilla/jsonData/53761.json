I'm sending an html content in stringbuffer and then i convert it to string and send it in Transport.send(msg) as argument (here msg) and when the mail is sent it displays perfectly in HTML format without displaying tags, as you know Transport.send doesnot return the converted html to mail format String it returns void .. So wat was i thinking that it should return the converted html string so that i can use it in displaying the mail. Because When i directly try to  send a html string  to mail as body parameter it displays with html tags which should not happen \"SEE THE ATTACHEMENT\". I have searched every where but no use please you guys help me out !!! I hope you guys look into the matter and reply as soon as possible please help me with this \n\n\nThanks\nAvinash", "id": 161608, "time": "2012-08-22T07:50:52Z", "creator": "avinash.jayakar@dbcomsys.com", "creation_time": "2012-08-22T07:50:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ognjen.d.blagojevic@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 161611, "time": "2012-08-22T09:15:22Z", "bug_id": 53761, "creation_time": "2012-08-22T09:15:22Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 53760 ***"}]
