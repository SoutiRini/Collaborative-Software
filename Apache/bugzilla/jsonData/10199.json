Previous versions have left a\ntangled mess of directories, so I have to use a bunch of configure options\nlike --runtimedir, --logdir, --htdocsdir and so forth.  Some of the\ndirectories I'm specifying are something like /usr/local/etc/httpd_foo/logs,\nwhile --prefix=/usr/local/etc/httpd.  When I run configure with --show-layout, \nit tells me, for instance,\n  SERVER_CONFIG_FILE: _foo/conf/httpd.conf\nNote that it seems to have lost the first part of httpd_foo.\nIt makes with no error messages, but when I run \"httpd -t\" it says,\nhttp: could not open document config file   \n   /usr/local/etc/httpd/_foo/conf/httpd.conf\nNote that it has broken the name httpd_foo into two parts.\n\nObviously I could work around this by changing the directory names\nand reorganizing them in a more up-to-date arrangement.  I was\nhoping to have a solution I could just drop in place to minimize\ndown time."}]
