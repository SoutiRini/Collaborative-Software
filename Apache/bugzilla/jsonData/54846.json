[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54846, "text": "Sometimes it is desirable to ignore particular samples where you do some setup that is not interesting to be recorded. For example login and similar. Changing layout of test plan often does not look nice.\n\nI think org.apache.jmeter.samplers.SampleResult can be extended to have a property ignore or ignoreByListeners. For scripting samplers one can set that property. And for other samplers the transaction controller can be extended to support marking it's parent sample to be ignored so one can put any samples to be ignored under a transaction controller.\n\nRegards", "id": 166610, "time": "2013-04-14T21:09:20Z", "creator": "akostadinov@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-14T21:09:20Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Do you consider your request similar to 54333 ?
