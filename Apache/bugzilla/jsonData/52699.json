Ex:\n\n> At midnight, on March 8th, 2002, /foo/bar.log will be copied to /foo/bar.log.2002-03-08. Logging for the 9th day of March will be output to /foo/bar.log until it is rolled over the next day. \n\nBut at 00:00:00 8/3/12, no logging events for 8/3 have been generated, and logging for the 9th day of March doesn't even start until the next day (after it has rolled over?)\n\nSo, if I understand the code correctly, this should instead read\n\n> At midnight, on March 8th, 2002, /foo/bar.log will be copied to /foo/bar.log.2002-03-07. Logging for the 8th day of March will be output to /foo/bar.log until it is rolled over the next day. \n\n\nP.S. the comment on line 319 is also wrong, I think. s/datedFilename/scheduledFilename/", "id": 153880, "time": "2012-02-17T17:13:46Z", "bug_id": 52699, "creation_time": "2012-02-17T17:13:46Z", "is_private": false}]
