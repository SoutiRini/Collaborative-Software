For Lenya sites using SSL, IE\ngives a mixed security warning (\"This page contains both secure and nonsecure\nitems\") when one accesses the site tab.\n\nAs a work-around, users can disable this warning in IE (Tools > Internet Options\n> Security > Custom Level > Display mixed content).  But the real bug appears to\nbe in how the javascript code (lenya/resources/javascript/navtree.js) generates\nURL's to gif's.  Lee's work-around of hard-coding the scheme and host in the\ndefinition of IMAGE_PATH in line 53 of lenya/xslt/info/root.xsl is effective,\nbut we need to replace that hard-coded scheme and host with an <xsl:value-of\nSOMETHING>.  What is that SOMETHING?  Alternatively, we could change how\nnavtree.js uses IMAGE_PATH so that the scheme and host are included when the\njavascript runs.\n\nThe original line in root.xsl is:\n\nIMAGE_PATH = \"<xsl:value-of select=\"$contextprefix\"/>/lenya/images/tree/\";"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37549, "is_private": false, "id": 82643, "creation_time": "2005-11-18T09:35:29Z", "time": "2005-11-18T09:35:29Z", "creator": "josias.thoeny@wyona.org", "text": "The scheme and host you have to prepend are defined in publication.xconf, right?\nMaybe the ProxyUrlModule could be extended to get these parameters.
