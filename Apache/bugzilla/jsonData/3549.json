If there were some \n<jsp:include> statesment - the <jsp:param> statement doesn't work well.\n\nExample:\n\n<jsp:include page=\"/servlet/testServlet\" flush=\"true\">\n<jsp:param name=\"Test\" value=\"height=20, width=20\"/>\n</jsp:include>\n\nwhen I now parse the params (request-object) in the servlet testServlet, i \ncouldn't find a param \"Test\". The Problem is the \"=\" Char in the value field. \nAlso Tomcat has its problems with \";\", \"&\" or linebreaks in the value-clause of \nthe jsp:param statement. Therefore we cannot use tomcat4 to build our \nwebapplication. Tomcat 3.x works fine with \"=\" Chars, but still has its problem \nwith \"&\", \";\" or linebreaks. \n\nSincerely\n\n  Ronald Bernhard Interflex GmbH & CoKG", "id": 5355, "time": "2001-09-11T07:20:14Z", "creator": "rbernhar@interflex.de", "creation_time": "2001-09-11T07:20:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Servlet containers require that the URLs they process must conform to spec\nrequirements.
