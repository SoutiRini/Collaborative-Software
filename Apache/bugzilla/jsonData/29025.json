Implementation of multiple layout strategies, should we\never be doing this, is still possible, and with roughly the same complexity,\nhowever by reimplementing and/or subclassing apps.Document instead.\n\nThis simplifies the LayoutManager code and makes the tracing of Document\ncreation a bit easier to follow, hopefully beneficial for other developers\nbesides me.  The motivation for this change is that currently I'm trying to\nimplement space-before correctly in fo:static-content (as a digression, doesn't\nwork on pages past the first, because I reset its value to zero for fo:flow,\nneed to find a way to differentiate the layout between the two types) and some\nreduction of the number of dimensions of the source code makes it easier for me\nto understand the process.\n\nAnyway, if no complaints I'll commit this in a couple of days.\n\nThanks,\nGlen", "id": 57523, "time": "2004-05-16T19:10:50Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-05-16T19:10:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": 11572, "text": "Created attachment 11572\npatch file", "id": 57524, "time": "2004-05-16T19:12:47Z", "bug_id": 29025, "creation_time": "2004-05-16T19:12:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29025, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 155974, "time": "2012-04-01T06:51:08Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:51:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
