At \nleast it cannot get the Content-Type header which is set in servlet.\n\nI have tried several configuration directives in httpd.conf, but nothing makes \ndifference. mod_ssl website gives directives to use with IE and all these were \napplied. \n\nTomcat was upgraded to 4.03, but it did not help, also connector was originally \nmod_webapp but that didn't help.\nI upgraded from Apache 1.2.23+mod_ssl-2.8.7, but that didn't help either.\n\nregards,\n\nAntti Lehto", "id": 12749, "time": "2002-04-03T13:55:44Z", "creator": "antti.lehto@helsinki.fi", "creation_time": "2002-04-03T13:55:44Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "TC4.0.2 and 4.0.3 has included a new cache expiration directives on role\nprotected contexts.
