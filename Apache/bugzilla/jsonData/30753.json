[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hey\n   I've added some patch's and new classes to enable batching. The user can\nprovide a jmeter property mode to specify what behaviour they want.\n\nSo -Dmode=Standard (Also default) provides the normal behavior.\n   -Dmode=hold_samples provides the exsisting hold_sample behavior.\n   -Dmode=Batch provides the new batching behavior.\n\nI created new classes for each type and use a Factory to return the correct type.\n\nI added another remote method to RemoteSampleListenerImpl that accepts a List\nand then fires the samples locally on the client.\n\nThe batch mode stores sample events untill either a time or sample threshold is\nbreached. The sampleStore is reset if either one fires.If only one threshold is\nset it becomes the only value checked against.When a threhold is breached the\nlist of sample events is sent to a listener where the events are fired locally.\n\nThe time/sample threshold or both are set as Jmeter Properties time_threshold\nand num_sample_threshold. The time is in milliseconds. I provided a default of\n100 samples or 60 seconds. But I guess you guys would know what it should be set\nto. \n\nI've used it and it seems to work fine so I hope its of some use to someone.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 30753, "id": 62175, "time": "2004-08-19T14:45:55Z", "creator": "michael.freeman@sabre-holdings.com", "creation_time": "2004-08-19T14:45:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30753, "attachment_id": 12486, "id": 62176, "time": "2004-08-19T14:46:39Z", "creator": "michael.freeman@sabre-holdings.com", "creation_time": "2004-08-19T14:46:39Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 12486\nPatch plus new classes"}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": 12487, "bug_id": 30753, "is_private": false, "id": 62177, "time": "2004-08-19T14:51:22Z", "creator": "michael.freeman@sabre-holdings.com", "creation_time": "2004-08-19T14:51:22Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 12487\nUploaded zip file as text.
