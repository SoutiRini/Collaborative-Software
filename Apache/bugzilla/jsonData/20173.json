NamingContext.bind(foo, Reference Class Name: Foo, false) is called.\n\n2. The init method is called but fails, see above.\n\n3.

It would appear to be \nan oversight in the container setup procedure.\n\nCheers,\nRichard.", "id": 37654, "time": "2003-05-23T05:12:06Z", "bug_id": 20173, "creation_time": "2003-05-23T05:12:06Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "is_private": false, "id": 51942, "time": "2004-02-08T23:26:48Z", "bug_id": 20173, "creation_time": "2004-02-08T23:26:48Z", "tags": [], "text": "I think this was fixed - it works fine for me for autostarted servlets.
