It's difficult to read a message with many lines.\n\nI've attached a diff file with the following changes:\n- The \"JNDI name Receive queue\" and \"JMS Selector\" fields are now positioned as  BorderLayout.SOUTH and BorderLayout.NORTH, instead of BorderLayout.EAST and BorderLayout.WEST\n- Preferred size of the \"Content\" field is set to Dimension(400, 150). This value is currently used in the \"Text Message ...\" field of the JMS Publisher Sampler\n\n\nThe diff file was created using TortoiseSVN 1.7.9 in Windows XP SP3\n\n\nBest regards,\nBruno Antunes", "id": 166331, "time": "2013-04-02T16:31:19Z", "creator": "b.m.antunes@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-02T16:31:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 30136}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54788, "text": "Date: Tue Apr  2 19:43:47 2013\nNew Revision: 1463718\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/r1463718\nLog:\nBug 54788 - JMS Point-to-Point Sampler - GUI enhancements to increase readability and ease of use\nBugzilla Id: 54788\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/protocol/jms/org/apache/jmeter/protocol/jms/control/gui/JMSSamplerGui.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 166336, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-02T19:44:35Z", "time": "2013-04-02T19:44:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54788, "text": "Thanks for patch, applied.", "id": 166337, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-02T19:44:54Z", "time": "2013-04-02T19:44:54Z", "is_private": false}]
