The module simply relays the response to \nthe client using the ap_rputs() function.\n\nThe problem with Apache v2.0 is that it always assumes responsibility for \nconstructing and dispatching an HTTP header.  For our module, the consequence of \nthis behavious is that the client receives two blocks of HTTP headers - those \ngenerated by Apache and those generated by the Application Server.  Earlier \nversions of Apache would not automatically return HTTP headers to the \nclient unless you explicitly told it to (via the ap_send_http_header() \nfunction).\n\nThe question is, is there any way of suppressing the headers delivered by Apache \nv2.0 for a content handler ?  What's needed is (sort of) the equivalent of the \nCGI 'nph-' directive.  It would be nice to not have to strip out the HTTP \nheaders returned by the Application Server, just for the purpose of setting them \nindividually through the various Apache 'set HTTP header' functions. \n\nBTW, on a separate but not totally unrelated note: some proper documentation for \nthe Apache v2.0 API would be welcome !\n\nThank you in advance."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "See the current code for mod_asis.c as an example of how to\nremove the HTTP output headers filter.", "id": 14917, "time": "2002-04-27T17:50:58Z", "bug_id": 8587, "creation_time": "2002-04-27T17:50:58Z", "is_private": false}]
