It's on care and maintenance,\nis it not? It shipped in 1998 or 1998 as I recall, which makes it 4-5 years old.\nWith 400+ plus bugs in ant right now, I am going to have to run from this one. \n\nIf you do want a VB6 project, ant-contrib.sf.net would be a place that could be\nwilling to host it, but you would still be left to code it yourself.
