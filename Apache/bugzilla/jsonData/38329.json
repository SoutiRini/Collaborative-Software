In the http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager I do \nnot see a disable.  Let me try to explain differently.\n\n  Imaging the setup where you have 2 IIS servers (web1 and web2), each using \nisapi_redirect.dll to communicate to 2 Tomcat servers (TC1 and TC2).  web1 has \na higher lbfactor to TC1 and web2 has a higher lbfactor to TC2.  All is good \nand evenly balanced.  Both TC servers house an application \ncalled /application1.\n  Now you decide you want to \"stop\" /application1 on TC1 to do some work.  You \nuse manager (http://TC1:8080/manager) to stop the applicaiton and do some \nwork.  At this point, web1 still sees that TC1 is up and answering on 8009.  \nTC1 is also serving content - in the form of an HTML page stating \"Application \nUnavailable\".\n  What I am suggesting is that isapi_redirect.dll on web1 detect \nthe \"Application Unavailable\" message and fail over to TC2.\n\nIs this clear and can you see the benefit?\n\nKevin", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 84850, "time": "2006-01-21T16:42:09Z", "bug_id": 38329, "creation_time": "2006-01-21T16:42:09Z", "is_private": false, "text": "You have been clean enough :)\n\nThat's why we have status worker, so you can manage\nload banacer members.
