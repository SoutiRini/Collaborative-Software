I can think of two possible reasons (maybe both are correct, maybe neither..):\n\n1. JMeter does not scan the whole CLASSPATH on startup, trying to find all the available Look & Feels, but instead it uses a constant list of Look & Feels - such that there is no way to add a custom Look & Feel without changing the code and recompiling JMeter.\n\n2. The placement of the JARs in the \"lib\" directory does not automatically add them to CLASSPATH, so even if JMeter does scan CLASSPATH classes, the 3rd party libraries will not be scanned as it is not enough to just place them in the \"lib\" directory - need to specify additional switches to JVM when starting JMeter.\n\n\n\nI'll be glad if you could tell if any of those reasons is correct and to tell how I can add the 3rd party L&F or add the possibility to do it in the next version.\n\nThanks!"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60588, "attachment_id": null, "id": 196522, "time": "2017-01-28T11:34:13Z", "creator": "felix.schumacher@internetallee.de", "creation_time": "2017-01-28T11:34:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I can't see a special handling for any L&F.
