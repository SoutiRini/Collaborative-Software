By this I mean that each of the build/validates that we are doing can\nrun in parallel, with the exception of the JFCUnit portion due to focus\nissues.\n\nSo, wrap the JFCUnit portion of the validate in the <Wait> <Notify> tasks. What\nwait does is create a lock file, check for other locks, of none exist, it goes\nforward. If other locks exist, it removes its lock file and does a random wait\n(based on parameters) and tries again. <Notify> simply removes the lock.\n\nI have a test build file and the working tasks if anyone wants to see and play\naround."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30422, "attachment_id": 12287, "id": 61413, "time": "2004-07-31T04:15:46Z", "creator": "dak@dotech.com", "creation_time": "2004-07-31T04:15:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 12287\nThis is the complete source for the <Wait> task"}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": 12288, "creator": "dak@dotech.com", "text": "Created attachment 12288\nThis is the complete source for the <Notify> task", "id": 61414, "time": "2004-07-31T04:16:17Z", "bug_id": 30422, "creation_time": "2004-07-31T04:16:17Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30422, "attachment_id": 12289, "text": "Created attachment 12289\nThis is a sample build file that test the wait/notify tasks", "id": 61415, "time": "2004-07-31T04:17:02Z", "creator": "dak@dotech.com", "creation_time": "2004-07-31T04:17:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "dak@dotech.com", "text": "Created attachment 12290\nThis is a jar that contains the wait/notify tasks.
