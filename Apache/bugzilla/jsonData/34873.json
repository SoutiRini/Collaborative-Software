I did, and e/thing works sweet.\n\n     I have to mention here that, I do not know that the whitespace is causing\nthe problem, but that is the only variable that changed in the 2 installations,\nand the 2nd time it worked.\n\nDutt.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 34873, "id": 74860, "time": "2005-05-13T21:09:34Z", "creator": "duttbobba@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-05-13T21:09:34Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34873, "text": "Works for me, out of the box.
