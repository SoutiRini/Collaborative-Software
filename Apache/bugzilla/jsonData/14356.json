I did so with \"embed-file=...\" set in the \nfont metrics file and everything worked fine. Now I omitted the \"embed-\nfile=...\" statement and created a new PDF-file based on the same XSL and XML \nfiles. The result is not really nice, only dots appear in the PDF file (viewed \nin Acrobat Reader). Also the font properties of the _correct_ PDF file are \nquite unusual: Instead of embedding a TrueType font FOP embeds a TrueTypeCID \nfont using \"Identity-H\"-coding instead of Windows-coding. \n\nSo, how can I get FOP embedding a TrueTypeFont in Windows coding __OR__ what do \nI have to do that the created PDF can be viewed correctly without embedding the \nfont? (The font is available on the system where the PDF is viewed).\n\nMM"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "johnglinux@eyecatching.com", "text": "I posted a message before about this issue.
