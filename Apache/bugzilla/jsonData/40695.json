In order to make internal links work in PDF, \nI have applied fo:basic-link under fo:inline element. \n\nThe issue that i am facing is that when the text on which there is a link is \ntoo long and the text comes in more than one line, the link is only on starting \nfew characters and not on the rest of the text. But if the text comes in a \nsingle line then the link appears on  the entire text. So the issue really is \nwhen the text is long and comes in more than one line the link is not properly \nrendered. \n\nKindly help me on this as it is an urgent requirement. \n\nThanks, \nShriram", "count": 0, "id": 94584, "time": "2006-10-06T06:48:01Z", "creator": "gupta.vinod@ge.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-06T06:48:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40695, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please state which version of FOP you are using: 0.20.5 or 0.92beta.", "id": 94648, "time": "2006-10-09T02:22:36Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-09T02:22:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 94649, "time": "2006-10-09T02:49:51Z", "bug_id": 40695, "creation_time": "2006-10-09T02:49:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "FOP 0.20.x is no longer supported.
