This is _not_ what this Bug is\nabout.\n\nI tried to do this:\n\nI generated a certificate with three alternative DNS names (like aaa.domain.de, \nbbb.domain.de, ccc.domain.de) and tried to configure three virtual web servers\non the same HTTPS port, just as I would configure them on HTTP. Since they are\nintended to share the same certificate, the certificate selection problem should\nnot exist. However, Apache does not even start, it reports that SSL was already\ninitialized. Obviously, every instance tries to freshly initialize SSL, even if\nit has already been initalized. That's the bug.\n\nTo demonstrate the bug you don't need such a special certificate, just try to\nput more than one virtual webserver on the same 443 HTTPS port.\n\n\n(Using the debian apache-ssl package)\n\nregards\nHadmut", "id": 85317, "time": "2006-02-01T19:07:19Z", "creator": "hadmut@danisch.de", "creation_time": "2006-02-01T19:07:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38481, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please attach your virtual host configuration.
