However, this shouldn't be an issue because we meant exactly that with the sample code provided above. \nThat is, for some tasks that can be used as resources seems to be normal the tasks to be executed before they can be used as resources.\nIf we don't provide this enhancement, the users will be forced to workaround in a similar way: they will execute the task (in the above case - output the concatenation in a file) and then use the output of the task as a resource.", "id": 126622, "time": "2009-04-29T06:20:51Z", "creator": "st_lazarov@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2009-04-29T06:20:51Z", "attachment_id": null}]
