I suggest adding a drop down when doing request/reply to choose of the following correlation strategies:\n\n1) Request CorrelationId to Response CorrelationId\n2) Request MessgaeId to Response MessgaeId\n3) Request MessageId to Response CorrelationId\n\n\nI have attached a patch file that implements these scenarios.  Also included in the patch are some changes to make working with WebSphereMQ easier.  For example WMQ doesn't allow the CorrelationId to be set via setStringProperty.  So in the addProperties method if the property name is JMSCorrelationID, the msg.setJMSCorrelationID is called.", "id": 119459, "time": "2008-08-05T18:21:41Z", "bug_id": 45571, "creation_time": "2008-08-05T18:21:41Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks for the patch; applied to SVN in trunk:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701218&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 45571 - JMS Sampler correlation enhancement\n", "id": 121160, "time": "2008-10-02T12:26:41Z", "bug_id": 45571, "creation_time": "2008-10-02T12:26:41Z", "is_private": false}]
