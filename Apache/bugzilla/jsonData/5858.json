[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5858, "text": "Hi!\nThere is currently no way to store native libraries within Tomcat such that Java\ncan load them. If I copy some native libraries from outside (using the Manager\ntool), they have to go into a directory already known to the OS loader. This is\nvery inconvenient for several reasons (e.g. dlls that are only used by a webapp\nhave to be installed elsewhere; I may not have the rights to copy files into\nsome system path).\nI suggest to add some standard Tomcat directory (e.g. $CATALINA_HOME/bin or\n$CATALINA_HOME/lib) to java.library.path or alternatively to %PATH% or\n$LD_LIBRARY_PATH, respectively. This must be done from outside Java (e.g. by\ncalling 'java -Djava.library.path=...') because it can't be set by an\napplication such that the VM loader respects this.\n(Currently, I copy the files into the directory where Tomcat is started under\nWindows, or patch Tomcat to include '.' in LD_LIBRARY_PATH under UNIX,\nrespectively.)", "count": 0, "id": 9646, "time": "2002-01-15T03:21:21Z", "creator": "hans.schlenker@first.fraunhofer.de", "creation_time": "2002-01-15T03:21:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Closing this as won't fix as there has been no interest in this enhancement \nrequest for over 2 years.\n\nYou can always use the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable to set \njava.library.path", "attachment_id": null, "id": 62003, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "time": "2004-08-15T14:36:47Z", "bug_id": 5858, "creation_time": "2004-08-15T14:36:47Z", "is_private": false}]
