Everything works fine when i execute in Windows machine but not in Linux machine. The table creation using XSLFTable inside a PPT slide is causing the issue. As suggested in other forum i tried including all POI3.9 jars along with ooxml-schemas-1.1.jar (full version - around 14MB). Also i've tried excluding poi-ooxml-schemas.jar among all the jars. Nothing seems working. PPTx is getting generated but when i try to open the file, it says \"File has been corrupted\". If i comment out \"table creation set of code\", PPTX file is opening perfectly. \n\nCan somebody throw some highlight on this issue?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "kiwiwings@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 186067, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 55416, "creation_time": "2015-10-29T01:25:03Z", "time": "2015-10-29T01:25:03Z", "text": "I'm closing this entry now, as it's already quite old and there have been a lot \nof changes in X/HSLF in the meantime.\nIf you are still facing this issue with a current version of POI, please add a \nfull example (... not just a screenshot of your jars)."}]
