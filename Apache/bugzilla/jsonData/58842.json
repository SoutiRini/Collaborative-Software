It only updates when I restart Apache service.\n\nSO I am tempted to think that :\n- If the DNS server is authoritative, Apache saves in its cache the answers from this DNS server\n- If the DNS server is non-authoritative, Apache doesn't save in its cache the answers from this DNS server\n\nWhat do you think about it?\nIs it right?\n\nAny help would be greatly welcome.\n\n\nRegards \nBroisy"}]
