Currently I am facing this issue:\n\nMy excel file contains some of the drawing objects. That causes HSSF throw this error when I try to create a workbook for the input file,\n\n\norg.apache.poi.hssf.record.RecordFormatException: Unable to construct record instance\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.record.RecordFactory$ReflectionRecordCreator.create(RecordFactory.java:64)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.record.RecordFactory.createSingleRecord(RecordFactory.java:263)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.record.RecordFactoryInputStream.readNextRecord(RecordFactoryInputStream.java:270)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.record.RecordFactoryInputStream.nextRecord(RecordFactoryInputStream.java:236)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.record.RecordFactory.createRecords(RecordFactory.java:392)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook.<init>(HSSFWorkbook.java:276)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook.<init>(HSSFWorkbook.java:201)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook.<init>(HSSFWorkbook.java:317)\n        at org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook.<init>(HSSFWorkbook.java:298)\n\n\nHowever, when I remove all the drawing objects from the input excel it reads the excel file without any issues. \nI tried to search for some workbooksetting object, which could allow me to disable(in Java) the drawing objects of the excel while reading it, or some option with which I can read the excel file even if it has the drawing objects( as the objects are critical to the project, I can not remove them).But could not find any such setting with HSSF.\n \nPlease let me know about any such option/setting if it exists in POI library.Or let me know the way to read such excel files having drawing objects.\n\nThanks in Advance,\n\nRegards,\n\nRakesh", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 48654, "is_private": false, "id": 136578, "time": "2010-04-30T18:47:57Z", "creator": "dfisher@jmlafferty.com", "creation_time": "2010-04-30T18:47:57Z", "tags": [], "text": "Without an example of the smallest possible file showing your bug it will be difficult to solve this bug."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48654, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 161434, "time": "2012-08-15T20:19:35Z", "creator": "superrubiroyd@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-08-15T20:19:35Z", "text": "This problem should be fixed in trunk.\n\nPlease try with a nightly build - see download links on http://poi.apache.org/\nor build yourself from SVN trunk, see http://poi.apache.org/subversion.html"}]
