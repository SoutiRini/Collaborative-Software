During installation I provided path to\nj2sdk 5.0 beta 3 build 60, therefore tools.jar has been taken from this\nparticular distro. After that I had been forced to switch JVM to IBM's 1.4.1\n(WebSphere 5.1 AppClient). Tomcat starts with no problem, however, Jasper\ncompiles JSP with javac from tools.jar (jvm 5.0 compliant) and makes compiled\nclasses unusable for the 1.4.1 jvm. \n\nThe simplest workaround is to overwrite tools.jar with the one that comes with\nthe jdk that tomcat is run on.  However, the simple solution is to provide the\n\"target\" parameter to JspServlet and pass it along to ant javac compiler. \n\n...Yes, I know we're going to get rid of ant compiler... ;) BTW, I wonder which\nversion of classes JDT will produce.
