It would be very nice to have\nthe possibility of negative arguments for it.  So [S=1] means skip the next rule\n(already exists), [S=0] means use the next rule (a no-op in other words), [S=-1]\nmeans loop/reevaluate this rule, [S=-2] means goto the previous rule, etc., and\n[N] means goto the first rule (already exists).
