Make some modification to it, and then choose to Exit\nJMeter.  It will ask if you want to save the Test Plan.  Answer Yes, and it will\npop up a File dialog (since this Test Plan has not been saved before).  Press\nCancel in the File dialog.\n\nI would expect this to return to JMeter without exiting -- just as if you\npressed Cancel when JMeter asked if you want to save before exiting.  Instead,\nJMeter will exit without saving."}]
