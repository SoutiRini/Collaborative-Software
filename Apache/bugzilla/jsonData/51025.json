Attached to this bug are two patches:\n\n - fix the ErrorHandlerTestCase to expose this bug - the current test is picking up the results from the first test run resulting in a false positive suceess.\n\n - update PropertyConfigurator to set the appender on the defined ErrorHandler, as xml.DOMConfigurator does, plus a set of fixes to parse the property file correctly.  fixing parsing without the appender fix results in a npe, as there is no primary appender.  fixing the the appender without the parser updates prevents a failback appender from ever being configured.", "attachment_id": 26858, "bug_id": 51025, "id": 145569, "time": "2011-04-05T17:19:09Z", "creator": "g@raphaelli.com", "creation_time": "2011-04-05T17:19:09Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51025, "attachment_id": 26859, "is_private": false, "id": 145570, "time": "2011-04-05T17:20:02Z", "creator": "g@raphaelli.com", "creation_time": "2011-04-05T17:20:02Z", "text": "Created attachment 26859\nUpdate PropertyConfigurator to process errorhandler directives"}]
