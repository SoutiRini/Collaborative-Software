Note that the extractors are getting the correct values from the \ncorrect response type.\n\nSave your test plan just to be sure.\n\nClose the test plan.\n\nReopen the test plan.\n\nRun the test.\n\n\nActual Results:\n===============\nAfter running the test the second time, the extractors are now not getting \nthe correct values.  Also if you look at the second extractor which should be \nset to Body, it is now set to Header.\n\n\nExpected Results: \n=================\nThe Extractor response field values should be loaded correctly since when \nlooking \nat the JMX file, the values are saved correctly.  It isn't displayed correctly \nnor \nis it run with the correct values.\n\n\nBuild Date & Platform: \n======================\nJMeter 2.0.1 and June 12 nightly build.\n\n\nAdditional Information:\n=======================\nRunning in non-gui mode behaves correctly as expected. \nThis radio-button oddity seems to also apply to Results Status Action Handler \nelement."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks for the report.\n\nChecked in a fix to the rel 2.0 branch and HEAD for Regex and Result Status \naction GUI elements.\n\nClosing call - please reopen if there are still problems.", "id": 60088, "time": "2004-07-01T23:32:12Z", "bug_id": 29853, "creation_time": "2004-07-01T23:32:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 31141 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 63480, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "time": "2004-09-13T17:03:14Z", "bug_id": 29853, "creation_time": "2004-09-13T17:03:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29853, "text": "*** Bug 12144 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 63936, "time": "2004-09-20T23:49:09Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-09-20T23:49:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29853, "attachment_id": null, "id": 63939, "time": "2004-09-20T23:51:22Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-09-20T23:51:22Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 31321 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 31479 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 64467, "creation_time": "2004-09-30T22:58:52Z", "time": "2004-09-30T22:58:52Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "bug_id": 29853, "is_private": false}]
