Or is this a discrepancy between opening files from the command line vs. opening them from file->open?\n\nBecause I always use jmeter in gui-mode running from C:\\data\\progs\\jmeter\\bin and have my jmx files in C:\\data\\svn\\tests\\jmeter\\[module1,2,3/common] (where common contains setup sequences which are included with an include controller and a path like \"../common/setup.jmx\").
