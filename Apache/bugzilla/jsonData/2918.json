I started jakarta as root and was able to shut it down as my\nregular test account.  OS: RedHat Linux 7.1. Is there a way to protect jakarta\nfrom shutting down from unauthorized access?  I have searched bug database and\ncould not find any FAQ or reference so I appologize in advance if I overlooked\nit. The severity is critical as you can cause a DOS (Denial of Service) by\nshutting down the jakarta server as a regular user, and it would look as if the\nserver shutdown by itself.  Thank you.\n\nHasani Hunter\nhasani@hunterdynamics.com"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2918, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 4842, "time": "2001-08-25T10:00:21Z", "creator": "cmanolache@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2001-08-25T10:00:21Z", "text": "Resolved in 3.3, where you can add password auth."}]
