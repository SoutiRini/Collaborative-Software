The recorded test plan would be used to validate that requests have not changed between runs, and serve as a base for updated load tests.\n\nNow that https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57305 has been fixed, it should be fairly easy to solve. I think it could be done in a fashion similar to bin/mirror-server.sh. \n\nThe script could terminate and write the test plan on CTRL+C/SIGINT.\n\nIn order to facilitate things like variable substitution & response logging, I think it would make sense to be able to provide a test plan as input to the script (the script would then load this file before starting the recording)"}]
