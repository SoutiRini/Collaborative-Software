Extracting the new one placed 'httpd-2.3.10 (2)' on the desktop.\n\nWhen you're in the folder, ./configure works fine, but make won't. You have to change the folder name to something else (I used apache2.3) and it works fine then.\n\nNot the biggest bug in the world, and sorry if it's in the wrong category, but it's the best I could figure out."}]
