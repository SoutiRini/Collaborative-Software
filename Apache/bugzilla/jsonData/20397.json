(Done \nseparately because these need to move to different directories in CVS)\n\n1) Apply both patches in either order.  \n2) Move newly patched LayoutHandler to area and StructureHandler to fo packages.\n3) Then build the application.\n\nThanks,\nGlen", "id": 38139, "time": "2003-06-01T19:05:44Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-01T19:05:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20397, "attachment_id": 6588, "is_private": false, "id": 38140, "time": "2003-06-01T19:06:23Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-01T19:06:23Z", "text": "Created attachment 6588\npatch:  changes to structure & layout handler needed"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20397, "attachment_id": 6589, "text": "Created attachment 6589\nother changes needed in related files", "id": 38141, "time": "2003-06-01T19:07:04Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-01T19:07:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 39606, "time": "2003-06-29T19:39:05Z", "bug_id": 20397, "creation_time": "2003-06-29T19:39:05Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Done (except LayoutHandler moved to layoutmgr package instead.)"}, {"count": 4, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 156349, "time": "2012-04-01T07:13:05Z", "bug_id": 20397, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:13:05Z", "tags": [], "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed"}]
