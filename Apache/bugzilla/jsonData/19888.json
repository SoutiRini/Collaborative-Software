[{"count": 0, "text": "for v 1.11 HEAD \nThis patch contains two related fixes. \n\nThe first is to allow CellReference and AreaReference constructors to recognize \na reference containing a sheet name.\nThis allows CellReference to be used with the reference returned by \n\ne.g.\n\n        HSSFName orderRefName = wb.getNameAt(wb.getNameIndex(\"OrderReference\"));\n        CellReference cellRef = new CellReference(orderRefName.getReference());\n        HSSFCell orderNameCell = wb.getSheet(cellRef.getSheetName()).getRow\n((short)cellRef.getRow()).getCell((short)cellRef.getCol());\n\nThis wasn't absolutely necessary since HSSFName has a getSheetName method but \nit makes cell reference more useful in the general case. (though CellReference \nwill probably need a workbook reference as well for properly modeling formulae)\n\nThe second makes AreaReference return an array[1] if it was passed a simple \ncell reference.
