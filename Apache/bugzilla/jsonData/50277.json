Currently if we want to determine if any columns are hidden, we need to call isColumnHidden(int) once for each column, which runs the iterator once for each call.  For a large number of columns this is a significant performance hit as the operation becomes O(n^2).", "id": 141738, "time": "2010-11-15T20:23:17Z", "creator": "trejkaz@trypticon.org", "creation_time": "2010-11-15T20:23:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "text": "This would need implementations for both HSSF and XSSF, and would also need logic on things like Row.createCell() to update the lastColumnNumber information as the sheet data grows\n\nIt would hopefully be a fairly small enhancement to make, if someone fancies tackling this....!", "id": 176785, "time": "2014-07-30T23:18:02Z", "bug_id": 50277, "creation_time": "2014-07-30T23:18:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "text": "These methods are available since a long time now...", "id": 183216, "time": "2015-05-31T21:36:57Z", "bug_id": 50277, "creation_time": "2015-05-31T21:36:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
