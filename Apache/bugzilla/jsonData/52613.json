Running the Test Plan passes it through URLDecoder once.\n\nI need to post XML content to a web service, and that content includes a \"%\" symbol. I can either escape it 4x to save and run (e.g. \"%25252525\"), or escape once and run (e.g. \"%25\"). After either case, saving or running the Test Plan mangles my Post Body, so I have to start over.\n\nTo illustrate the problem quickly, create an HTTP Request with \"%%\" alone in the post body and save. You should get \"Problem updating GUI - see log for details\". The first error in the log (among a few) is:\n\n2012/04/12 12:38:59 ERROR - jmeter.gui.GuiPackage: Problem retrieving gui java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: URLDecoder: Illegal hex characters in escape (%) pattern - For input string: \"%?\"\n\n- Unable to use \"%\" symbol in request and responce data:\nThere is an error in gui when try to use symbol \"%\" in request or when it exists in responce data\n\nE.g. if request POST data has to have string like \"%AO2012\" JMeter report an error in GUI and post an exception into log (stack_trace.txt)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Add HTTP request\n2. Switch to RAW data \n3. Input string like \"2004016611|AOconnectRequest:AHconnect:ASDateTimeFormatInfo:ALCurrentDate%AO20120313150624#\" (this is a part of GWT request to server)\n4.
