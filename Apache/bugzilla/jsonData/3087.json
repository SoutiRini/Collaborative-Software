This problem didn't seem to happen on a Linux-box.  It \nprobably happens on all Window boxes... but I only saw this on an NT box.\n2) XSLT file with a 'redirect' extention.  The filename that it points to should \nbe a relative address.\n3) ANT build.xml file has a target that processes this XSLT file using the TRAX \nprocessor.\n\nIt should give you a TransformerException error when it hits the REDIRECT \nextension.\n\nThe problem, I think, is caused by the code in TraxLiaison.java where it \nprepends each filename with \"file:\".  It should be \"file:///\" or possibly \nnothing at all.  I got the source, changed it to \"file:///\" and it worked \nperfectly.  Note, the XalanLiaison.java class ALSO does this, however it doesn't \nseem to cause the same problem.  Seems Linux forgives this \"file:\" format, while  \nWindows NT does not."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3087, "text": "It's tricky to fix because of various bugs and behavior related to systemid.\nIt should be fixed by now in the next nighly build...hopefully.\nI added simple testcases for Xalan1 and Xalan2.", "id": 4496, "time": "2001-08-11T15:18:15Z", "creator": "sbailliez@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-08-11T15:18:15Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sbailliez@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 4498, "time": "2001-08-11T15:25:10Z", "bug_id": 3087, "creation_time": "2001-08-11T15:25:10Z", "tags": [], "text": "Note that since there is no nightly build for optional jar, if you want to \ncheck for it, you must get the CVS version in ANT_14_BRANCH"}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "mike@slac.com", "is_private": false, "id": 4527, "time": "2001-08-13T09:54:36Z", "bug_id": 3087, "creation_time": "2001-08-13T09:54:36Z", "tags": [], "text": "I pulled down the 1.4 Beta, and the \"///\" fix was added, and I compiled it,\nand ran it... and it worked.
