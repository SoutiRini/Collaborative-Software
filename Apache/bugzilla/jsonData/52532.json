However, having the same entry appear more than once in a given NVH chain does cause unnecessary and duplicate comparisons (when the NVH isn't matched via its ServerName, ServerAlias, or ServerPath values).\n\nSolution:  One should check the existing NVH chain to see if the entry being added is already on that list before adding it.  I have not even looked at the code so I leave that for someone else more familiar with apache to deal with."}]
