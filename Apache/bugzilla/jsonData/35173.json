While editing content, it takes 4 clicks to open the \"Add Asset\"\nchooser (not including saving the current work), if a user can even find it. \nThen it takes 4 clicks to get back to editing the content where the asset is needed.\n\nSOLUTION: Add a Title field and an upload control to the content editors. \n(Title is already required for Assets.)  \"Save Asset\" returns the current page\nwith the new Asset on the list.\n\n\"Insert Image\" should be list of all assets in the pub.  Do not expect users to\nfigure out paths (kupuimages/kupu_icon.gif).  Just show the Titles, and let\nLenya use the correct path.\n\nAsset Titles should be unique within a pub.  (Assets are currently per page.) \nUser-friendly method is to add creation date to the Title if already exists:\nmain/logo.gif = \"Company Logo\"\nsales/logo.gif = \"Company Logo (20050601)\"\nSales can fix the Title (from the Assets menu) if they dislike it, but keep the\nmethod for adding them easy.  (Unique the filenames too.)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "these ideas have already been implemented. i'm closing the bug", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 35173, "id": 102507, "time": "2007-04-26T09:23:00Z", "creator": "nettings@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-04-26T09:23:00Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35173, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 102508, "time": "2007-04-26T09:23:26Z", "creator": "nettings@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-04-26T09:23:26Z", "text": "these ideas have already been implemented. i'm closing the bug"}]
