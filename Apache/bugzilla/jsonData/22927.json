The jsp behaves exactly as expected when the server has\njust been reboot. However, after the first time someone has found any results at\nall, things go haywire when no results can be found. When no results can be\nfound, the sql:resultset displays some random blurb. Sometimes this will be the\nbody of the previous sql:resultset. At other times the body of fmt:bundle is\ndisplayed. It looks as if the body of the last succesfully processed tag is\ndisplayed again somehow.\n\nI can't really figure out whether this is a bug of the sql tag, an error in the\nBodyTagSupport class or of course something I'm doing wrong.
