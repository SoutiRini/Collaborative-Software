Rule extensions were only meant to be used in uriworkermap.properties, and I was quite astonished when testing now, that they also work for JkMount.\n\nIn r1187950 I added support for their use when dynamically defining worker names using JK_WORKER_NAME.\n\nNote that some rules need a comma in their value, which will result in a syntax error when used in a RewriteRule. You can instead use SetEnvIf if it suffices for your needs. Otherwise you are limited to the rules that don't need a comma.\n\nRegards,\n\nRainer"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Forgot to mention it: will be part of version 1.2.33.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 51743, "id": 150854, "time": "2011-10-23T20:13:47Z", "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2011-10-23T20:13:47Z", "attachment_id": null}]
