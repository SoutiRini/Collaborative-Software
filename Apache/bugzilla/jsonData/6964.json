(I'd prefer to do both in one step, but I'd need to write a special \npaint handler and I'm too lazy).  Regardless,it would be nice if a shape/path \ngets reused that it be placed in the defs section and reUSEd; which could \nresult in some significant space savings.  The problem is with mutable shapes \nlike the Arc component; immutable shapes would be easy.  Just a suggestion.  \nThanks and keep up the good work."}]
