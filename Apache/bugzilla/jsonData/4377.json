[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4377, "attachment_id": null, "text": "There is a requirement that Fop run on JDK 1.1.x.  It currently will not run on\nanything earlier than JDK 1.2.  I tested this on JDK 1.1.3 for the Sun.  The\nreason is because the code is calling a method that was introduced in JDK 1.2. \nNamely, java.io.File.getParentFile().  This call is being made from:\n\nOptions.java line 96\n\nas well as 3 other files.
