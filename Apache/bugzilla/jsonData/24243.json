Before posting to this mailing list i've readed Apache docs 2.1 \n(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/) and searched Google for possible answers \nbut without luck. My question is related with dynamic listings that Apache show \nwhen somebody access to a directory that doesn't have an 'index' file. I have \nthe next folder structure:\n\n\nCAE\n|\n|_ Updates\n   |\n   |_ Old\n\n\nI want that 'Updates' and 'Old' listings have a 'Parent Directory' link on\ntop (as usual) but i don't want that 'CAE' listing show that 'Parent\nDirectory' link. I've tried several configurations with 'IndexIgnore ..'\noption into 'CAE', 'Updates' and 'Old' directives but without luck. I'm out\nof ideas...\n\n\n2) [Robert Andersson] --> It seems you're out of luck. You can disable the \nparent entry by using \"IndexIgnore ..\", but as far as I can see, there is no \nway \"unignore\" it.\n\nmod_autoindex is intentionally not very flexible, because what it does is soo \nsimple. If you really don't want the parent entry in the listing, you can make \na Perl or PHP script rather quick, that behaves and look exactly like you want.\n\n\n3) [Rafael Faura] --> Well, seems like I should learn some PHP and Perl to make \nsuch script, anyway thanks for your reply. Maybe a little suggestion for future \nApache/mod_autoindex versions: allow to put 'Parent Directory' link per \ndirectory instead how is done now (parent entry always appears).\n\n\n4) [Robert Andersson] --> The problem is not specific to the \"parent directory\" \nentry, but general in that (it seems) one cannot remove entries previously \nadded to the IndexIgnore list higher up in the directory tree. There should \nperhaps be an \"IndexIgnoreRemove\" directive, in which case you could do:\n\n    <Directory /path/to/docroot/CAE>\n        Options +Indexes\n        IndexIgnore ..\n    </Directory>\n    <Directory /path/to/docroot/CAE/Updates>\n        IndexIgnoreRemove ..\n    </Directory>\n\n\n---------------------\n\nThat\u00b4s all :)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rw263@nyu.edu", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 59930, "time": "2004-06-27T02:09:02Z", "bug_id": 24243, "creation_time": "2004-06-27T02:09:02Z", "text": "Bug present in Apache httpd-1.3\nIndexIgnore would be helpful in both versions"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24243, "is_private": false, "text": "Dear Apache.
