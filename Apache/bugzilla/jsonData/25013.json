Only files that I decide to change are real,\nall else symbolic links.\n\nAs I have learned since, symbolic links are not supported out of the box.\n\nThis enhancement request is about making it easier for people like myself\nto know what it is that is biting them.\n\nThe error messages I get are, e.g., \n\n   SEVERE: Error reading tld listeners javax.servlet.ServletException:\n   Exception processing TLD at resource path\n   /WEB-INF/jsp2/jsp2-example-taglib.tld in context /jsp-examples\n   javax.servlet.ServletException: Exception processing TLD at resource path\n   /WEB-INF/jsp2/jsp2-example-taglib.tld in context /jsp-examples\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig.tldScanTld(TldConfig.java:696)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig.execute(TldConfig.java:348)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.\n           start(StandardContext.java:4108)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.\n           addChildInternal(ContainerBase.java:866)\n\nand so on (slightly edited for line breaks).\n\nThat give the unsuspecting user little clue.\nNo mention that \"symbolic links\" is the underlying problem.\n\nI propose that Tomcat's logging, as it comes out of the box,\nshould be configured in such a fashion that\nI'm told what I'm up against when things fail because of symbolic links.\n\nI understand there is a specific test for symbolic links that fails,\nso I would appreciate seeing the specific words \"symbolic link\" in\nsome log file.", "id": 48151, "time": "2003-11-26T12:16:45Z", "creator": "andreas.krueger@famsik.de", "creation_time": "2003-11-26T12:16:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 48613, "time": "2003-12-06T17:58:30Z", "bug_id": 25013, "creation_time": "2003-12-06T17:58:30Z", "tags": [], "text": "This seems like a good idea, and a specific message should be logged in this\ncase.
