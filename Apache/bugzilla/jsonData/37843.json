It needs to be brought more in \nline with the main project to make it more compatible. Better compatibility \nwill support portability of software using log4j from J2SE to J2ME (CDC). Among \nother things, log4jMini is still using Category instead of Logger class.\n\nlog4jMini can now be found in the sandbox at:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/sandbox/log4j/log4jMini\n\nI will address this issue with a log4jMini patch in the very near future."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 17182, "creator": "ralph.curtis@gabrielsoftware.com", "text": "Created attachment 17182\nUpdate and cleanup of log4jMini\n\nConvert from Category to Logger class use.
