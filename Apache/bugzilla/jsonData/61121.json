However, when I use the InfluxdbBackendListenerClient, I only get those stats for 'where \"statut\" =~ /all/'. \n\nWe use Grafana to plot 90th percentile response time for \"successful\" transactions. If I switch to InfluxdbBackendListenerClient, I lose that ability. I would have to show that stat for all transactions (successful and unsuccessful).\n\nIs there a way to the missing statistics or am I doing something wrong here?\n\nThanks.", "id": 198872, "time": "2017-05-24T14:02:06Z", "bug_id": 61121, "creation_time": "2017-05-24T14:02:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Hi, \n\nI've check the code and only percentil are send for 'all' statut.
