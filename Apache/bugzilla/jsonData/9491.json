I am forced to switch to httpd-20 and modperl-2, since a\nparticular configuration (with SSL and <Directory>) doesn't work with\napache-1.3, but it will with httpd-2.0\n\nPorting the module to modperl-2.0 isn't so eays, since the book \"Writing Apache\nModules with Perl and C\" from Stei & MacEachern only covers modperl-1.0\n\nTherefore, I decided to use the compat-mode of modperl. Unfortunately, it seems\nthat this doesn't work at all.\n\na simple example:\n\n--- test3.pm ---\n\npackage test3;\n\nuse strict;\n\nuse Apache2;\nuse Apache::compat;\n\nBEGIN {\n        print(\"test3.pm::BEGIN\\n\");\n        Apache::log_error(\"test3.pm::BEGIN\");\n}\n\n1;\n\n--- end ---\nthis will result in:\n---\nUndefined subroutine &Apache::log_error called at /root/Portal/test3.pm line 17\n---\nI fixed that by \"aliasing\" Apache::log_error to Apache->server->log_error, by\nadding \"sub Apache::log_error\" to\n<...where-perl-lives>/Apache2/Apache/compat.pm.\n\nHowever, more complex code will still fail.\n\ne.g., when I \"use Apache::Table();\", I will get:\n---\nCan't locate object method \"boot\" via package \"mod_perl::boot\" at \n/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/i686-linux/Apache/Table.pm line 6.\nCompilation failed in require at /root/Portal/Apache/PortalAuth.pm line 17.\n---\nThe code (\"PortalAuth.pm\") *did* work flawlessy with modperl-1.0, but it does\nnot with the compat-mode of modperl-2.0. I am stuck here, and our project\nis stuck too. This is a point where I cannot proceed :-(\n\n\nbest regards,\nherber rosmanith"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9491, "text": "You'll have to take this up with the mod_perl authors over at perl.apache.org, \nas it's clearly mod_perl related and not a bug in Apache itself.
