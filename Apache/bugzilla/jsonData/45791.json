[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Many sites (like the one I'm administering) are using Apache to offload HTTPS while proxying the requests with mod_proxy to an application server (WebLogic or JBoss in our case). The application servers operate solely in HTTP and the HTTPS traffic is being terminated on the Apache's.\n\nThis results in a problem when there are mixed sites with different vhosts running on the same application server. Some vhosts are accessible over HTTPS only, while other vhosts are mixed HTTP/HTTPS.\n\nThe problem is with cookies. For the HTTPS-only vhosts, we would like to set the cookie to HTTPS-only, but this cannot be done since the application server does not know if it is serving a request for a HTTPS-only or mixed vhost.\n\nTherefore, we would like to have a new directive in Apache's mod_proxy (for example ProxyPassReverseCookieSecure), much like the existing ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain and ProxyPassReverseCookiePath, that switches cookies set by the application server to HTTPS only. This in light of the recently released CookieMonster application that checks security of websites and their cookies (see: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/11/cookiemonstor_rampage/)", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 45791, "id": 120559, "time": "2008-09-12T06:28:26Z", "creator": "ajunne@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-12T06:28:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "text": "This is possibly a seldom requirement.
