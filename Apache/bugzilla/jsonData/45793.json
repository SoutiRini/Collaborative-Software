[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45793, "text": "mod_rewrite directives are allowed within <location>, where they behave as if they are inside a <directory> or .htaccess file. This is highly unintuitive and thus very difficult to debug. \n\nThe distinction between <Location> and <Directory> is that one operates on URLs, the other on file paths. mod_rewrite operates on file paths in both contexts. Since the documentation states that use of mod_rewrite inside <location> is both unnecessary and unsupported, Apache should either warn or fail saying \"mod_rewrite is not supported within <location> directives\" or similar. This would help prevent mysterious configuration errors.\n\nMore generally, I question the wisdom of having such context-dependent behaviour in the first place. URL matching and file path matching are distinct operations and should have distinct directives. Of course, I accept we're probably stuck with it now...\n\n(Yes, I have just wasted two days of my life trying to work out why my rewrites were behaving oddly)", "id": 120561, "time": "2008-09-12T07:17:14Z", "creator": "andrewg+asf@andrewg.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-12T07:17:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 41055 ***", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 45793, "id": 123292, "time": "2008-12-14T14:57:41Z", "creator": "bobsiegen@googlemail.com", "creation_time": "2008-12-14T14:57:41Z", "is_private": false}]
