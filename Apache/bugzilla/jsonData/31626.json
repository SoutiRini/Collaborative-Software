From the small amount of digging \nI've done the GUI would seem to enforce this as the dates are converted into \nlongs and saved in the test plan. \nI would prefer that string values were allowed in these fields so that I could \nuse a function and property to set the start and end time of a test from the \ncommand line. I'm currently in a situation where the number of threads, \nrampup, delay etc are all set from the command line based on properties but if \nI want to re run a test I need to edit the JMX to set the times correctly. In \nterms of automated testing having these time values able to be command line \ndriven would make a lot of sense (to me anyway).\n\nIf there is an alternate way to get this behaviour (apart from using cron or \nat jobs) can someone let me know?\n\nThanks\n\nAndrew", "id": 64899, "time": "2004-10-11T00:12:11Z", "creator": "andrew.r.bredhauer@transport.qld.gov.au", "creation_time": "2004-10-11T00:12:11Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "You could try the delay and duration fields, which are both in seconds. \n\nThis would mean calculating the offset to the desired start time, but at least\nyou should be able to pass the values in on the command line.\n", "id": 65017, "time": "2004-10-12T23:12:33Z", "bug_id": 31626, "creation_time": "2004-10-12T23:12:33Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
