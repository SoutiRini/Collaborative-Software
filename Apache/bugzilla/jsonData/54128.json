In effect any task that completes inside of the 100 ms window will have to wait for the sleep(100) call to finish at which point the non-blocking read call realizes it has exhausted all data and actually exits.\n\nThe correct approach is to go back to blocking reads but upon detection of process termination follow a few simple steps:\n\n1. Use non-blocking available() call on the input ends of the subprocess's stdout,stderr streams and spin w/ 100 ms sleep until no bytes are available.  You can be certain this will exhaust all output because it runs after it is known that the subprocess has already exited.\n2. Call destroy() on the process object.  This closes the input streams which has the effect of unblocking the blocked read calls.\n3. Continue with the rest of the original code which is to stop the stream handler which joins the reading threads.  Because the read calls have been unblocked and exhausted all input the join will complete immediately in all cases.\n\nThis has been tested on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and it restores the exec task speed back to ant 1.7 series levels (i.e. 20 seconds to run our exec-heavy build task instead of 2-3 minutes).\n\nIt will obviously require testing on the Windows platform where the original Bug 5003 was reported to verify it didn't regress that bug fix."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54128, "text": "I have an ANT build.xml that perform <exec> task for 400++ times.
