Neither does it handle versions for parallel deployment (to be fair, I don't believe parallel deployment was implemented when this patch was proposed).\n\nThe design of auto-deployment is based on the assumption that the context path and version derive from the base file name. I haven't seen a good enough reason not to extend that logic to WAR upload given that a rename before upload would address this. Hence the WONTFIX."}]
