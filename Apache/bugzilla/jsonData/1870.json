However, when \nthe same wbmp file is accessed on a host running Apache server, the image is \ndisplayed correctly on all the WAP phone simulators\n\n\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\n1) install Tomcat (jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1) on the selected host\n2) install Apache Web server on an alternative host\n3) install the Nokia WAP toolkit on a PC running NT with Service Pack 5; this \nshould be installed with the WAP Server simulator selected int the device \nsettings\n4) Using Tomcat 3, point the WAP phone simulator to the following wml file \n(monica is a Solaris host):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC \"-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.wapforum.orig/DT\nD/wml_1.1.xml\">\n<wml>\n    <card class=\"\" id=\"I1\" title=\"IMAGE\">\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"http://monica.logica.co.uk:8080/wmlta/mdml/wmltasystest1/s\nunny.wbmp\" alt=\"Logica \"/>\n        </p>\n        <do label=\"Back\" type=\"prev\">\n            <prev/>\n        </do>\n    </card>\n</wml>\n\n5) Using Apache, point the WAP phone simulator to the following wml file \n(trafford is a solaris host):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC \"-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.wapforum.orig/DT\nD/wml_1.1.xml\">\n<wml>\n    <card class=\"\" id=\"I1\" title=\"IMAGE\">\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"http://trafford.logica.co.uk/icons/sunny.wbmp\" \nalt=\"Logica \"/>\n        </p>\n        <do label=\"Back\" type=\"prev\">\n            <prev/>\n        </do>\n    </card>\n</wml>\n\n\n\nACTUAL RESULTS\nIn step 4 above, Tomcat 3 is used to access the wml file containing an image \nref link through a servlet. The alternative text (Logica) is always displayed \non the WAP phone simulator\n\nIn Step 5 above, Tomcat 3 is used to access a similar wml file, in which the \nimage ref link is accessed via Apache. In this case the wbmp image is displayed \non the WAP phone simulator\n\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS\nThe image should be displayed on the WAP phone simulators and is so when \naccessed via Apache\n\n\nMIME CONFIGURATION\nWe have tried various Mime extensions in the conf/web.xml file:\nimage/vnd.wap.bmp\nimage/vnd.wap.wbmp\napplication/octet-stream\nBUT none of these appear to make any difference\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\nThe same problem appears to have been observed  - \nSee the last para in the Sun Forum discussion article, ref wbmp mime types:\nhttp://forum.java.sun.com/read/16789542/q_Ilu5fPI13wAAmB9#LR\n\nHowever, unable to locate anything similar in the Bugzilla bug database", "is_private": false, "id": 2614, "creator": "hartnellg@logica.com", "time": "2001-05-23T07:46:15Z", "bug_id": 1870, "creation_time": "2001-05-23T07:46:15Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1870, "attachment_id": 173, "id": 2615, "time": "2001-05-23T07:51:00Z", "creator": "hartnellg@logica.com", "creation_time": "2001-05-23T07:51:00Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 173\nThe wbmp file to be displayed"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "hartnellg@logica.com", "attachment_id": 174, "id": 2616, "time": "2001-05-23T07:53:07Z", "bug_id": 1870, "creation_time": "2001-05-23T07:53:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 174\nsuccessful Wap phone simulator display(when accessed via Apache)"}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": 175, "creator": "hartnellg@logica.com", "is_private": false, "id": 2617, "time": "2001-05-23T07:54:24Z", "bug_id": 1870, "creation_time": "2001-05-23T07:54:24Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 175\nSuccessful display on Wap phone simulator (accessed via Apache)"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Mime extensions should be specified in WEB-INF/web.xml.
