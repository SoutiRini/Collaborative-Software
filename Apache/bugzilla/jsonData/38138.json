[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I am developing a build system where everything is self contained.  I am doing\nit this way to avoid problems with different setups on different machines.  So,\nany JARs I need I keep within the build system directory structure.  To help\nenforce this I supplied both -noclasspath and -nouserlib on the command line.  I\ndid not specify -lib.  When I run the build I get the following error:\nUnknown argument: -noclasspath\nNote: -noclasspath was specified as the first command line parameter.\nFrom the documentation that I can find on the subject, my understanding of what\nshould happen in this case is as follows.  The only elements that should be in\nthe classpath are the items in ANT_HOME\\lib.  Note: if I add -lib %ANT_HOME%\\lib\nalong with the other two arguments everything works.  My belief was that the ant\nlib directory would be included in the class regardless.  This does not appear\nto be the case.\nIt is possible that this is correct behaviour.  In which case, I would suggest\nthat the documentation needs clarifying.\n\nThe following is the contents of the batch file I am using to run the build system.\n\n@echo off\n\nsetlocal\n\nset BUILD_HOME=%~dp0\nset ANT_HOME=%BUILD_HOME%apache-ant-1.6.5\nset PATH=%ANT_HOME%\\bin;%PATH%\n\nset WTK_HOME=%BUILD_HOME%\\wtk\n\nset ANT_ARGS=-noclasspath -nouserlib -lib %ANT_HOME%\\lib\n\nant -buildfile=%BUILD_HOME%build.xml -Dbasedir=%CD% -Dwtk.home=%WTK_HOME% %*\n\nendlocal\n\n\nAs I mentioned before, with the -lib parameter it works, without it causes the\nUnknown argument error.\n\nRegards", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 38138, "id": 84271, "time": "2006-01-05T16:29:23Z", "creator": "simon_c_wood@yahoo.co.uk", "creation_time": "2006-01-05T16:29:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38138, "text": "I beleive this bug is a duplicate of 36171 which was fixed in HEAD about 3\nmonths ago.\n\nCheckout, compile, and use the latest version of\nant/src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/launch/Launcher.java from the repository. \nThis should fix your problem.", "id": 84273, "time": "2006-01-05T19:04:11Z", "creator": "BBurgess@tiaa-cref.org", "creation_time": "2006-01-05T19:04:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38138, "text": "ping?", "id": 87794, "time": "2006-04-11T21:27:11Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-04-11T21:27:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38138, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Benjamin's diagnosis will stand.", "id": 90696, "time": "2006-06-27T21:39:19Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-06-27T21:39:19Z", "is_private": false}]
