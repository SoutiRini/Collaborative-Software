I noticed 4.1.30 contains a backport of Coyote 1.1. \n\nI've confirmed that minProcessors and minSpareThreads does not work as\ndocumented on 4.1.30.  I set minSpareThreads=\"30\" and minProcessors=\"50\".  I\nstarted tomcat, then sent 1 request to the server, and forced a thread dump.  I\nsee TP-Processor[1-4] in the dump (note that \"4\" is default value for\nminSpareThreads).   I then sent concurrent requests, and did another dump.
