This would enable round-trip testing during development by the web \npage developer without having to introduce them to message bundles.  (Of \ncourse, they would still have to learn the i18n tags and the message argument \nformatting syntax.)  This also ensures that a default \"locale\" is always \npresent so long as default text is provided.  Message bundles may then be \nreserved for specific localizations.\n\nAlso, there should be a way to suppress the exception thrown when a bundle file \nis not found.  When the message tag default text is adequate for the \"default\" \nlocale during development and, possibly, during initial launch, a redundant or \nempty bundle file should not be required.\n\nThe current work-around is to type something like the following into the web \npage:\n\n<% Double D = new Double( 123456789.987654321 ); %>\n<i18n:message key=\"number\">\n  <i18n:messageArg value=\"<%= D %>\" />\n  Number = <i18n:formatNumber value=\"<%= D %>\" pattern=\"#,###.###\" />\n</i18n:message>\n\nThen the bundle file must exist and either not define a \"number\" key or contain:\n\nnumber=Number = {0,number,#,###.###}\n\nIf nothing else, this just complicates the extraction of message tag default \ntext to generate a bundle file."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "JSTL replaced the i18n taglib, so this won't be worked on.", "is_private": false, "id": 128690, "creator": "bayard@apache.org", "time": "2009-07-10T00:33:13Z", "bug_id": 3164, "creation_time": "2009-07-10T00:33:13Z", "attachment_id": null}]
