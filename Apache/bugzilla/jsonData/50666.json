The get default can be used to ensure the value is not null.\nThe set default is useful to ensure that the property is not added to JMX files if it is empty. Obviously the same defaults must be used!\n\nWe try to use this for new properties, otherwise the JMX files keep growing.\n\nNo need to update the patch - that can be fixed later.", "id": 143702, "time": "2011-01-27T07:23:19Z", "bug_id": 50666, "creation_time": "2011-01-27T07:23:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "chris.issues@gmx.net", "attachment_id": 26573, "text": "Created attachment 26573\nPatch to support durable subscriptions to JMS Subscriber Sampler\n\nRevised patch:\n- updated component_reference.xml\n- uses setProperty() with default", "id": 143784, "time": "2011-01-29T02:10:05Z", "bug_id": 50666, "creation_time": "2011-01-29T02:10:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "chris.issues@gmx.net", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 26574\nScreenshot of JMS Subscriber sampler\n\nShows the \"Durable Subscription ID\" field", "id": 143785, "time": "2011-01-29T02:11:51Z", "bug_id": 50666, "creation_time": "2011-01-29T02:11:51Z", "attachment_id": 26574}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50666, "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #2)\n> Created an attachment (id=26573) [details]\n> Patch to support durable subscriptions to JMS Subscriber Sampler\n> \n> Revised patch:\n> - updated component_reference.xml\n> - uses setProperty() with default\n\nThe patch file is identical to the previous one - wrong file attached?", "id": 143937, "time": "2011-02-02T18:22:46Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-02-02T18:22:46Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "chris.issues@gmx.net", "attachment_id": 26772, "is_private": false, "id": 145014, "time": "2011-03-15T03:16:01Z", "bug_id": 50666, "creation_time": "2011-03-15T03:16:01Z", "text": "Created attachment 26772\nPatch to support durable subscriptions to JMS Subscriber Sampler (v3)\n\nSorry for the mess and the delay.
