[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I believe I've resolved this problem.  In Mark's case at least, it appears that \nwildcard resolution is faulty for a fileset like this:\n\n<target name=\"ejbc\" depends=\"compile\">\n    <ejbjar srcdir=\"${compile.home}\"\n\t\tdestdir=\"${build.ear}\"\n\t\tdescriptordir=\"${compile.home}/META-INF\" >     \t\t\n\t\t<weblogic destdir=\"${build.ear}\"\n\t\t\tclasspath=\"${app.classpath}\"\n\t\t\tkeepgeneric=\"false\"\n\t\t\tsuffix=\".jar\"/>    \t\t\n\t\t<include name=\"**/*ejb-jar.xml\" />\n\t\t<exclude name=\"**/*weblogic-ejb-jar.xml, **/*weblogic-cmp-\nrdbmsjar.xml\" />\n    </ejbjar>\n</target>\n\n\nbut is ok for a fileset like this:\n\n\n<target name=\"ejbc\" depends=\"compile\">\n    <ejbjar srcdir=\"${compile.home}\"\n\t\tdestdir=\"${build.ear}\"\n\t\tdescriptordir=\"${compile.home}/META-INF\" >     \t\t\n\t\t<weblogic destdir=\"${build.ear}\"\n\t\t\tclasspath=\"${app.classpath}\"\n\t\t\tkeepgeneric=\"false\"\n\t\t\tsuffix=\".jar\"/>    \t\t\n\t\t<include name=\"**/*ejb-jar.xml\" />\n\t\t<exclude name=\"**/*weblogic-ejb-jar.xml\" />\n    </ejbjar>\n</target>\n\n\nIn the former target, some beans attempt to compile from the weblogic-ejb-jar, \nhence they compile incorrectly.  I checked many versions of jdk and Ant under \nboth bash and DosPrompt on Mark's system, and I can only assume that this \nproblem is Windows 2000 related.  I've never experienced it on my 2 NT systems \nwith various versions of JDK and Ant.  I've checked in new build files, so \neveryone should update his CVS and be cognizant of this when you work with \nmakefiles.\n\nSpencer\n\nA few people have had some odd problems compiling common60 and cscommon using \nant.  Mark W. will get compilation errors for no good reason.  Collin G. will \ncompile things up fine but they won't deploy right.  \n\nI'm not sure these 2 items are related.
