[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5792, "text": "Hi. I'm currently working on a webapp running on Apache-Tomcat 4.0. The issue \nI've been having is that when two users simultaneously hit an uncompiled JSP, \nthe JSP compiler fails. Sometimes this results in one person being forwarded to \nthe error page showing an error message saying that the JSP could not be \ncompiled and the other person getting through, other times a more serious error \noccurs that causes the whole JVM to crash. It appears to me that this is a race \ncondition. Is there any synchronization between the two requests running in \nTomcat? Has anyone else encountered this error or anything like it?\nThe only solution I can find for now is to precompile all my JSPs before \ndeploying the webapp, but if someone could shed any light on my situation it \nwould be much appreciated.", "id": 9525, "time": "2002-01-10T11:37:20Z", "creator": "jpickard@usaninc.com", "creation_time": "2002-01-10T11:37:20Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "This looks like the same issue than 5203.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 5203 ***", "tags": [], "bug_id": 5792, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 9530, "time": "2002-01-10T12:40:00Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-01-10T12:40:00Z", "attachment_id": null}]
