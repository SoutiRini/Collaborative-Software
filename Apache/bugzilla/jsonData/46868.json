It will then send the log events to those clients.\n\nWhile this is a very cool feature during development it is not desireable to allow anyone on the internet to connect to this port and receive logging events.\n\nThe attached untested patch adds a new property \"BindAddress\". If it is set to a non-null value, the server socket will only bind to the interfaced identified by this ip-address.\n\nNote: This patch is totally compatible because an unset \"BindAddress\" property will show the old behaviour of binding to all interfaces.", "id": 125602, "time": "2009-03-17T08:15:47Z", "creator": "nhb_web@nexgo.de", "creation_time": "2009-03-17T08:15:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 23392}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Changing the signature of a protected method is an API break and starting names with an underscore doesn't fit with our coding standards, so the patch as submitted is not acceptable, however it seems like a good idea.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 131055, "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "time": "2009-10-10T11:33:09Z", "bug_id": 46868, "creation_time": "2009-10-10T11:33:09Z", "is_private": false}]
