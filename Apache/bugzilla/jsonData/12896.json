[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 12896, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Ant does not use declarative programming constructs (e.g. if, for, etc) but\ndeals with this by using dependencies, and by allowing most tasks to work over\nconfigurable filesets.\n\nHowever, the common requirement for a build all facility for large numbers of\nmodules is not yet managed cleanly, requiring each module to be defined,\ncreating a large administrative overhead. This problem is exacerbated, when\noptional modules are used, where the list needs to be defined twice (once for\n<availability> and once for <ant>).\n\nA solution to this, that is in keeping with the Ant methodology, is to allow\nexternal dependencies to be created. For example:\n\n    <target externalDependency=\"module1/build.xml\">\n\nto create a dependency on the complete script, or\n\n    <target externalDependency=\"module1/build.xml[subset]>\n\nto create a dependency on a subset of the script. The problem of optional\nmodules, requires the use of wildcarding.
