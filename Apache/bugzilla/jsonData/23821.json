Two comments:\n\n1. I did not add the <note> re: using ./build.sh instead of build.sh in some \nenvironments. IMO, this is really a dangerous precedent. If we document this, \nthen we probably need to document chown and chmod in case they don't have their \nownership and permissions set properly, and we may need to help them get \nnetwork issues resolved if the script resides on a remote filesystem, etc. \nThere really is no end to the amount of helpful information we can add that \nonly has the effect of making it difficult to find the FOP information that we \nare *really* trying to provide. If you disagree, please raise the issue on fop-\ndev, and we'll see if we can come to an agreement.\n\n2. The patch that you submitted did not have either DOS or Unix line-endings \nand my fancy editor did not recognize Mac line-endings either. I used the full \nfile that you submitted to get the patch done. In this case, that was no \nproblem, but in other cases it would make the job undoable. Open the file in vi \nto make sure that it is correct. (Instead of using your local file, download it \nfrom this bug -- it is possible that Bugzilla has converted something).\n\nThank you *very* much for the patch, and for your efforts in general toward \nmaking the doc better.", "is_private": false, "id": 45788, "creator": "vic@outfitr.com", "time": "2003-10-16T15:21:52Z", "bug_id": 23821, "creation_time": "2003-10-16T15:21:52Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "the.webmaestro@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I agree about the ./build.sh comment.
