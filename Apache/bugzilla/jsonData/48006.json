The field value should consist of one or\nmore implementation types, such as \"Servlet/2.4\". Optionally, the\nsupplementary information of the container and the underlying Java platform can\nbe added after the implementation type within parentheses. The container should\nbe configurable to suppress this header.\nHere\u2019s the examples of this header.\nX-Powered-By: Servlet/2.4\nX-Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 JSP/2.0 (Tomcat/5.0 JRE/1.4.1)\n...\n\nThis behavior is not implemented in Tomcat 6.0.20.\nTo make it totally clear, may I suggest to return the precise Tomcat and JVM version with all the digits and the vendor such as Tomcat/5.5.28 JRE/SUN/1.5.0_12-b04)\n\nHaving this headers helps a lot the development team to determine what is really running his application in test or production w/o asking to the maintenance guy who is either often unreachable or not able to answer (YES).\n\nProvide the option to remove the header through the configuration (file) or through programming (see related bugs 48004 and 48005).\n\nThe servlet 3.0 specification at\nhttp://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr315/index.html\nin the same section \"SRV.5.2 Headers\" says the same but I did not test for it in Tomcat 7.\n\nThanks\n\nOlivier"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48006, "attachment_id": null, "id": 131150, "time": "2009-10-15T11:41:34Z", "creator": "funkman@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-10-15T11:41:34Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is already available in conf/web.xml - default is off since its a waste of bandwidth and a security hole.
