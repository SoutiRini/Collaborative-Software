You have eliminated\none of the ways, which is to have it in the web.xml more than once.  The other\neasy way is to put the webapp that contains it under the \"webapps\" directory\nand add a <Context ...> definition in server.xml where you specify a \"path\" that\ndiffers from the directory name.  If AutoSetup is still present in server.xml\nthe servlet will be served in a Context based on the directory name of the\nwebapp, and will also be served in a Context you manually specified in the\nserver.xml.  This will result in two instances of the servlet being initialized.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and resolve it as \"invalid\", since there isn't enough\ninfo to determine if it is a bug or a config error.  If it is a bug it wouldn't\nbe fixed in Tomcat 3.1 since no support is occurring there.  If it is still\na problem in Tomcat 3.2.2 or Tomcat 3.3, please log a new bug.", "id": 2328, "time": "2001-05-08T13:14:44Z", "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "creation_time": "2001-05-08T13:14:44Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
