Once the upload is complete, it is supposed to redirect me to\na page that says that the upload has completed.  When the file is around 39 MB\nor larger, the upload page just hangs (even though the file has been uploaded,\nand the code that redirects has been executed). I looked at the access logs,\nand I never see the request for the redirect.\n\nIf the file is smaller (like 36 MB) the upload works fine, and I see the\nconfirmation page, and the redirect request in the access logs.\n\nI tried hitting all of the instances (we have 4 total) directly (not going\nthrough Apache), and I was able to upload some large files (40 MB, and 100 MB)\nsuccessfully.  As soon as I go through Apache again, this stops working...\n\nThis problem is always reproducible, and I have reproduced it using FireFox\n3.5.2 and Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.11.\n\nMore information:\nWe are using 2 Apache Web Servers, and have 4 WebLogic instances on two\nservers.\n\nI have attached some output from the access logs.", "id": 130084, "time": "2009-08-31T15:37:39Z", "creator": "kamil.kapadia@businesswire.com", "creation_time": "2009-08-31T15:37:39Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47773, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 130093, "time": "2009-09-01T00:28:54Z", "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-09-01T00:28:54Z", "text": "How do you connect apache with Weblogic?
