The HTTP content sent to the internet is not exactly the same as the content received from the internal site. It has some strings added (by 'added' I'm precise, the content is not overwritten, theese strings are added at certain points in the middle of the actual HTTP code). I believe they are debug info because I'm a programmer and its the type of code you add to trace a bug. The strings are:\n1) Always the same for a certain input.\n2) Always inserted in the same place.\n3) Always inserted (100% reproduceable).\nSample strings are '13', '38a', '80' and 'f6'.\nI'm sure its an Apache problem because I used Wireshark on the server to capture input and output streams in an HTTP (clear text) connection and they differ.
