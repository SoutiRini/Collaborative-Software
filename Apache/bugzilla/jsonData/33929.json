I think you want to\nuse 'viewBox=\"0 0 1 1\"' instead of objectBoundingBox.\nIt is important to realize that objectBoundingBox\nmaps coorindate 0,0 in the child to x,y of the 'object'.\nSo in your case the patternUnits already mapped \n0,0->x,y.  The reality is that the usecase for\npatternContentUnits is pretty weak people almost always\nwant/need viewBox.\n"}]
