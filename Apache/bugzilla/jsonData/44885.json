While the approach makes sense for absolute-positioned or rotated block-containers --and may turn out to be unavoidable for similar inline-containers-, regular block-containers would generate less overhead than regular inline-containers, which seems wrong somehow...?\nI am worried that a document with, say 200 inline-containers would generate just as many PageBreakingAlgorithms, and those can hardly be considered light-weight objects.
