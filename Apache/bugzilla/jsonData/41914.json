They should\nbe treating those symbols as imported (implicit unless _EXPORT or _STATIC has\nbeen defined).\n\nYou missed util/Makefile.in, caught that though and everything looks sane.\n\nSince we don't want to destroy iconv (and this is apriconv) - I'm building\nand installing the utility as bin/apriconv instead.\n\nI've also installed the two semi-public headers in include/apr-1/ to help\nresolve the aprutil build issues.\n\nBumping to 1.2.0 since this changes (corrects) installation assumptions.\n\nThank you for jumping off on this effort!"}]
