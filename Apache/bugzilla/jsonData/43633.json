Although your test table is a bit odd since it\ncontains an empty row (row 2). You can work around the problem by adding an\nempty cell in the row that contains the spanning cell:\n<fo:table-cell>\n  <fo:block/>\n</fo:table-cell>\nThat way you will get the expected result.\n\nFor devs: at least this test is a showcase for the strange loop in\nRowPainter.addAreasForCell ;-)\nSince row 2 is empty (contains no cell ending on this row), no\nTableContentPosition is created for this row. Thus, in\nRowPainter.handleTableContentPosition, the first test is never triggered for row\n2. So in addAreasAndFlushRow, the yoffset of row 2 is not recorded. And in\naddAreasForCell, when the offset of the first row spanned by the spanning cell\nis searched, it's not found so the while loop is triggered and the offset of the\nprevious row is returned instead.\nAs a consequence, the spanning cell, starting on row 2, gets the same offset as\ncell 1.1, and overrides it.\n\nI'll have a look at this later on, since the whole code handling empty/missing\ncells needs some touch-up anyway.\n\nVincent", "id": 109429, "time": "2007-10-17T08:16:23Z", "bug_id": 43633, "creation_time": "2007-10-17T08:16:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43633, "attachment_id": 20998, "id": 109431, "time": "2007-10-17T08:20:41Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-10-17T08:20:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 20998\nA minimal file to reproduce the problem"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43633, "attachment_id": null, "id": 111861, "time": "2007-12-18T11:03:23Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-12-18T11:03:23Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is fixed in rev. 605295 of the Trunk."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 156307, "time": "2012-04-01T07:09:10Z", "bug_id": 43633, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:09:10Z", "is_private": false}]
