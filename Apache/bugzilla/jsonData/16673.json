This works for some browsers (i.e. Netscape 4.08), but not for \nothers (i.e. IE 6) because of another bug:\n\nWhen using a wrapped cgi handler (I now refer to bug 16498), mod_include will \nenter 2 0-length lines after the output of an \"include virtual=\" element. (see \nthe 2 attachments output_cgi-scripthandler.txt and output_wrapped.txt for the \ndifference).\n\nIE thinks, after the first 0 line the file is done and closes connection. \nMaybe this is not according to protocol (I don't know the ins and outs), but \nit's certainly a problem with a lot of visitors, who all use IE 6. Better not \nto return these lines.\n\nPlease see the attachments of bug 16498 for the setup, and the to outputs \nenclosed here."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 4677\nRaw session using cgi-script handler (output_cgi-scripthandler.txt)", "attachment_id": 4677, "id": 30506, "creator": "apche_bug@spininhetweb.nl", "time": "2003-02-02T12:44:12Z", "bug_id": 16673, "creation_time": "2003-02-02T12:44:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": 4678, "bug_id": 16673, "is_private": false, "id": 30507, "time": "2003-02-02T12:45:55Z", "creator": "apche_bug@spininhetweb.nl", "creation_time": "2003-02-02T12:45:55Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 4678\nRaw session using a wrapper (AddHandler/Action) (output_wrapped.txt)"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "The description and the incorrect output you showed matches another\nPR I fixed earlier today: PR 15423.\n\nPlease verify that the fix for PR 15423 (small patch attached to that PR)\nresolves the problem.
