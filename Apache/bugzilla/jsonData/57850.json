According to my knowledge, the server only sends the certificate during the SSL Handshake, and the browser use its CA to do the verification. \n\n2. Is this directive dedicated to the model client authentication model ? Is it always mandatory to load CA in config Apache for simple SSL model ? Or maybe I only need to load certificate and private key to start Apache ?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nKindly regards,\n\nWeining", "id": 182592, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "weining.hou@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-04-23T10:26:45Z", "time": "2015-04-23T10:26:45Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "text": "Bugzilla is for reporting bug, not Q&A or support.
