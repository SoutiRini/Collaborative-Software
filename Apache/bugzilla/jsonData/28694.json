However \nit changes the original jsp name. For example, after I load my_login.jsp, it \nbecomes my_005flogin_jsp.java under \ntomcat/work/Catalina/localhost/_/org/apache/jsp\n\nIt seems 005f is the HEX of \"_\". So whenever I have _ in a jsp file, it will \nbecome 005f_.  Those compiled jsp file name will go into our log entry which \ncreated some problems with this extra \"005f\". \n\nPlease notify me if you have fixed this problem in next release.\n\nkmyu@yahoo.com"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28694, "is_private": false, "text": "Well, we do need to encode special characters.
