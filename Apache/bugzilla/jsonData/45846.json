[{"count": 0, "text": "Hi,\n\nI have a core build file deployed on a network file system that is accessible from both windows and unix. This core build file is imported and used by a number of other project builds that just provide properties to configure the core build for usage. \n\nThe core build file imports a number of other files containing utility macrodefs etc. These are deployed in the same directory as the core build (I use the dirname task to construct the import path for the other files). It uses UNC style paths to do this, for example:\n\n  <import file=\"//u/some/path/accessible/from/windows/and/unix/machines/build.xml\"/>\n\nPaths like this were handled without issue in ant 1.6.5. On unix the extra forward slash was irrelevant and on windows the path seps were flipped by java to yield a valid UNC path. However, if I run the following import on windows under a Java 6 VM with ant 1.7.1 I now get this error:\n\nCannot find build-utils.xml imported from C:\\u\\some\\path\\accessible\\from\\windows\\and\\unix\\machines\\build.xml\n\nI have seen a related problem if I put ant on the path using a UNC path (e.g. if I deploy my ant install on a network drive). When I run ant I get this exception.\n\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.tools.ant.Main\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:200)\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:251)\n        at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.run(Launcher.java:255)\n        at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.main(Launcher.java:104)\n\nThis goes if I map a network drive to the ant deployment directory and put it on the path using a path via this drive instead.\n\nDoes anyone know what's going one here?\n\nThanks,\n\nMiles", "bug_id": 45846, "is_private": false, "id": 120802, "time": "2008-09-19T08:57:28Z", "creator": "miles.daffin@morganstanley.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-19T08:57:28Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I can confirm this behavior in 1.7.1 and can confirm it is fixed in trunk.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 42275 ***", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 45846, "id": 120983, "time": "2008-09-25T06:47:32Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-09-25T06:47:32Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "text": "Which file contains the fix for this bug?", "bug_id": 45846, "is_private": false, "id": 121509, "time": "2008-10-14T09:48:09Z", "creator": "mbm@ptc.com", "creation_time": "2008-10-14T09:48:09Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 121521, "time": "2008-10-15T00:00:30Z", "bug_id": 45846, "creation_time": "2008-10-15T00:00:30Z", "text": "It is this commit\n\nhttp://svn.eu.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=631263\n"}]
