This behaviour leads Internet Explorer to display garbage when following a link to such a file.\n\nThis patch adds the correct MIME type for MPEG 4 files with extensions m4a, m4b, m4r and m4v. (It omits the m4p extension, which is both not widely used, and of limited interest since the data is encrypted.)\n\nReferences:\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4337\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14#.MP4_versus_.M4A_filename_extensions"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "Fixed in 7.0.x and will be included in 7.0.13 onwards.\n\nThanks for the patch.", "id": 145823, "time": "2011-04-16T18:54:09Z", "bug_id": 51050, "creation_time": "2011-04-16T18:54:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
