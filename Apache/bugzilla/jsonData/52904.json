I could not find any use of this functionality within Apache or outside it, only http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/apache/dev/372147 which says \"wait and see\".\n\nUnfortunately, this breaks if the MPM in use _does_ have a per-directory config; the config file is parsed twice, and since the config pointer will be different (and non-NULL) between the two calls to Listen(), there will be a fatal error. In particular, mpm-itk (mpm-itk.sesse.net) does this, which prevents a clean 2.4 port.\n\nPlease revert this patch (and optionally replace it with something cleaner); it is not in use by any current code and breaks a valid configuration, albeit one with external modules."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "r1304874\nproposed for 2.4", "attachment_id": null, "id": 155273, "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "time": "2012-03-24T18:12:11Z", "bug_id": 52904, "creation_time": "2012-03-24T18:12:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52904, "attachment_id": null, "id": 158854, "time": "2012-05-06T07:25:45Z", "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "creation_time": "2012-05-06T07:25:45Z", "is_private": false, "text": "fixed in 2.4.2"}]
