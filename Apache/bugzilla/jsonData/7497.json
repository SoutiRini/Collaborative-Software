I cannot\nfind any configuration problems in the /conf directory files (i.e. server.xml)\nand I have not made any changes to the given binary v4.0.3 distribution.\n\nI also extensively searched this bugzilla database and the mailing lists for\nsimiliar problems and did not find one.  However, I find it strange that I have\n2 different machines present the same error with the same binary, this is why I\nhave decided to enter this possible bug.\n\nInstalling and booting Tomcat 3.x *does* work on both machines and all example,\nservlet and custom folder webapps work perfectly fine\nScreen shots for your review:\nhttp://homepage.mac.com/javaseeds/images/tomcat323shot1.gif\nhttp://homepage.mac.com/javaseeds/images/tomcat323shot2.gif\n\nSecondary email address: javaseeds@yahoo.com", "id": 12357, "time": "2002-03-26T19:47:54Z", "bug_id": 7497, "creation_time": "2002-03-26T19:47:54Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 7497, "is_private": false, "id": 12373, "time": "2002-03-27T05:57:27Z", "creator": "javaseeds@mac.com", "creation_time": "2002-03-27T05:57:27Z", "tags": [], "text": "addedum:\nI found this snippet in the log files (I don't recall seeing it there before)\nand am not sure exactly what to make of it.
