[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "A tooltip is not displayed whenever a anchor (\"a\" element) has the \"xlink:title\" attribute [1] set.\n\nBatik already displays the contents of \"title\" and \"desc\" elements as tooltips, as suggested by the SVG specification [2], so I'd say we should also display the link title.\n\nI'm not sure how precedence should be handled (when a given link has \"xlink:title\" attribute and child \"title\"/\"desc\" elements), but it is suggested [3] that \"xlink:title\", when set, should take precedence over the other.\n\nA current workaround consists of adding a \"title\" child element to the anchor with the same content as the \"xlink:title\" attribute, which is then rendered by Batik. A test case with this idea was implemented [4] during experiments in order to force a pointer cursor in ASV3: one would expect a tooltip when hovering on the blue (leftmost) circle.\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#XLinkTitleAttribute\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#DescriptionAndTitleElements\n[3] http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/IG/wiki/Accessibility_Activity#Title_As_Tooltip\n[4] http://heldermagalhaes.com/stuff/svg/hacks/ASV3-EmulatePointerCursor.svg", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 48073, "id": 131457, "time": "2009-10-28T06:57:36Z", "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-10-28T06:57:36Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I forgot to mention I found nothing tightly related in the mailing list, although there were a couple of lightly related threads [1] [2].
