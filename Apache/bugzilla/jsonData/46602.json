The memory setting for the tomcat running the application server is 1024 mb.\nIt seems like the poi doesn\u00b4t release the memory after it is done with the metadata transfer for one document and before starting with the next. This makes the apache allocate more memory and in the end ending up with a out.of.mem exception in the log.\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n\nThe same test has been done without the metadata transfer and this does not end up in this error. \n\nWe are using Apache Tomcat 5.5.25 as application server and java 1.5.0_12.\nThe application is Webtop 6.0 SP1 (EMC) and the import is performed to documentum contentserver 6.0 sp1 (EMC).\n\nbr\nCarl Skymne", "id": 124364, "time": "2009-01-26T04:11:47Z", "creator": "carl.skymne@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-01-26T04:11:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46602, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I'm pretty sure this is a bug in your code, and you're not putting the old document out of scope before opening the new one.\n\nHowever, without any code, we can't know\n\nPlease re-open the bug if you can provide your code, and have already checked that you are really allowing objects to go out of scope", "id": 124366, "time": "2009-01-26T05:08:23Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2009-01-26T05:08:23Z", "is_private": false}]
