This is because the Image\ntask is taking the File.getName value and appending it to the dest dir instead\nof using a Mapper like IdentityMapper to do the mapping for it.  I have created\na patch which allows the Image tag to take a 'mapper' element and default to an\nIdentityMapper if none is provided.\n\nI don't see any way to attache the patch but I am assuming, this is my first\ncontrib to an open source project, that there will be a way on the next screen... :)\n\nThanks for the great tool been using it for years and I have found it to be very\nuseful."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30373, "attachment_id": 12257, "is_private": false, "id": 61284, "time": "2004-07-29T02:26:26Z", "creator": "danap@dhptech.com", "creation_time": "2004-07-29T02:26:26Z", "text": "Created attachment 12257\nThis is a patch off of the head revision."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 23243 ***", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 30373, "id": 77912, "time": "2005-08-01T16:48:32Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-08-01T16:48:32Z", "is_private": false}]
