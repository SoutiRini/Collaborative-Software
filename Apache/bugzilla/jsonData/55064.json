I\nattached a one-line patch that fixes it.  This problem and the patch\nare similar to the previously fixed Bug 55056.\n\nIn method \"ReportTreeListener.isValidDragAction\", the loop over \"path\"\nshould break immediately after \"isValid\" is set to \"false\".  All the\niterations after \"isValid\" is set to \"false\" do not perform any useful\nwork, at best they just set \"isValid\" again to \"false\".\n\nMethod \"include\" in class \"ClassFilter\" has a similar loop (over\n\"pkgs\"), and this loop breaks immediately after \"inc\" is set to\n\"true\", just like in the proposed patch.  Other methods (e.g.,\n\"Copy.keepOnlyAncestors\", \"JMeterThread.getSampleListeners\",\n\"HTTPSamplerBase.getSendParameterValuesAsPostBody\",\n\"LogFilter.incFile\") also have similar loops with similar breaks, just\nlike in the proposed patch."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "text": "Thanks for patch, applied.\n\nDate: Wed Jun  5 19:04:42 2013\nNew Revision: 1490008\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/r1490008\nLog:\nBug 55064 - Useless processing in ReportTreeListener.isValidDragAction()\nBugzilla Id: 55064\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/reports/org/apache/jmeter/report/gui/tree/ReportTreeListener.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 167684, "time": "2013-06-05T19:05:34Z", "bug_id": 55064, "creation_time": "2013-06-05T19:05:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
