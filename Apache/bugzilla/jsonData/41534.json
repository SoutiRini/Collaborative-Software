It is based on \"brief\", and I decided to call it\n\"quiet\". It only prints any output if a test fails. \n\nFor this change, I had to modify FormatterElement.java and JUnitTask.java, and\nadd QuietJUnitResultFormatter.java.\n\nI created a website that has complete source and binary tar.gz\ndistributions of a modified Ant 1.7.0 available, as well as a tar.gz\nfile with just the three Java files named above. It is available at:\n\nhttp://www.superscalar.org/files/apache-ant-1.7.0-quiet/\n\nAt this website, you can also see a comparison of the output generated by the\n\"brief\" formatter and the \"quiet\" formatter I have added.\n\nI have created a patch file using \"svn diff > quiet-patch-r503170\". It is based\non revision 503170. The patch file is available at:\n\nhttp://www.superscalar.org/files/apache-ant-1.7.0-quiet/quiet-patch-r503170\n\nPlease let me know if you have any interest in integrating this into\nfuture versions of Ant, if I have unknowingly duplicated a feature, or\nif I have done something else wrong.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for someone.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMathias Ricken"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41534, "text": "Created attachment 19503\nPatch file based on Ant revision 503170", "id": 98924, "attachment_id": 19503, "creator": "bugzilla.20.htowninsomniac@spamgourmet.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-02T20:30:19Z", "time": "2007-02-02T20:30:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41534, "text": "Created attachment 21682\nPatch file based on Ant revision 638724\n\nI have created and attached a patch file based on Apache Ant 1.8.0alpha, revision 638724.
