Basically the java-functions script referred to in the upstream bug should probably not concatenate $JAVACMD_OPTS to JAVACMD. As its name indicates JAVACMD refers to the executable, not to possible command arguments.\n\nThe fop script is based on the script shipped with ant, so that problem that's occurring with fop will most probably occur with ant as well. The removal of quotes in fop_exec_command worries me: there's certainly a good reason why they were added in the first place, probably to handle paths with spaces in them. I'm not keen to modify the script without a good reason, as it's designed to work on all types of Unix platforms, even those with ancient tools and shells. If we change it then it needs to be re-tested on all those platforms, which we don't have access to.\n\nI'm happy to hear comments or opinions about this, but I would close the bug as invalid.\n\nThanks,\nVincent"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46771, "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "count": 2, "id": 157454, "time": "2012-04-07T01:43:06Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:43:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46771, "text": "increase priority for bugs with a patch", "count": 3, "id": 157836, "time": "2012-04-11T03:20:15Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-11T03:20:15Z", "is_private": false}]
