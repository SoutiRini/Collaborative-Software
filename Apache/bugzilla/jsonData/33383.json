In GifImage we load the image from \nan InputStream using a \"DummyConnection\" which is a URLConnection. However, \nthe Sun ContentHandler for GIF images seems to use their own URLImageSource (a \nImageProducer descendant) which wants the URL in the URLConnection to be non-\nnull. Sun also has a InputStreamImageSource internally which they should \nprobably use in this case.\n\nI tried supplying a dummy URL to see if the code would still use the \nInputStream that was supplied, but the image was loaded from the URL. So it \nactually opens a new connection.\n\nIf anyone has an idea for a work-around, that would be cool.\n\nHappens under Sun JDKs 1.4.2_06 and 1.5.0_01."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33383, "attachment_id": null, "text": "GIF loading is now done through ImageIO.
