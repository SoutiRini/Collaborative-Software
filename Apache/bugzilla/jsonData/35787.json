Here we go: The FO file creates tables with collapsing border model \n(which is the default, but not fully implemented, yet. See warnings). Now the \ncode that produces the warning message you describe doesn't take into account \nthat the height property only applies to the table cell's content. The border \nwidths must not be taken into calculation whether the content is taller than \nallowed. But that's exactly what happens right now. So, yet another things to \nlook at for me.
