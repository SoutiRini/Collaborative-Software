Only the top row of a set of merged rows is being printed (see attached pictures). \n\nThe issue came up when I replaced this code (which is deprecated):\nmyWorkbook.setRepeatingRowsAndColumns(myWorkbook.getSheetIndex(mySheet), 0, rowHeaderColCount - 1, 0, freezeRow - 1);\n\nWith this code:\nCellRangeAddress ca = new CellRangeAddress(0, rowHeaderColCount - 1, 0, freezeRow - 1);\nmySheet.setRepeatingRows(ca);\nmySheet.setRepeatingColumns(ca);\n\nsetRepeatingRowsAndColumns() behaves correctly. Using the later code, when I print from Excel, the merged rows are cut off after the first page.", "id": 183257, "time": "2015-06-01T19:43:12Z", "creator": "jclaxton@utilinc.com", "creation_time": "2015-06-01T19:43:12Z", "attachment_id": 32773}]
