I'm guessing that this will be set to WONTFIX but I wanted\nto post this here to get an explanation.\n\nCurrently TC 5 ships a parser in common/endorsed. This is the Xerces 2.6 parser\nwith the parser classes (xercesImpl.jar) and the JAXP classes (xmlParserAPIs.jar).\n\nThe Servlet 2.4 specification reads \"The Web application class loader must load\nclasses from the WEB-INF/classes directory first, and then from library JARs in\nthe WEB-INF/lib directory.\"\n\nHowever if I put xercesImpl.jar in web-inf/lib this is *not* loaded the\nxercesImpl.jar from common/endorsed is loaded.\n\nAs I understand the specifications the endorsed classes form a limited set. As\nfor the XML classes the org.w3 package and the org.xml.sax are endorsed. However\nthe org.apache.* classes are not endorsed. This implies that *only* the\nxmlParserAPIs.jar file should be in common/endorsed as only this contains\npackages that should be endorsed. You can then move xercesImpl.jar to\ncommon/lib, which means that you can then use the JAXP specification to allow\nthe WEB-INF/lib to override the XML parser in common lib.\n\nBTW, doing this in 5.0.18 *doesn't  * work. The XML parser is loaded and Tomcat\nruns fine. But if I put xercesImpl in common/lib and web-inf/lib the one from\ncommon/lib is loaded, so that aspect would also need to be fixed.\n\nCould someone tell me if my reasoning is correct or not, as I said this is based\non my reading of the specifications and my understanding of how JAXP and the\nservlet specifications (2.4) should work.\n\nThanks\n", "bug_id": 26831, "is_private": false, "id": 52066, "time": "2004-02-10T16:58:35Z", "creator": "kevinj@develop.com", "creation_time": "2004-02-10T16:58:35Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "text": "This issue has been beaten to the death.
