[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "synfinatic@gmail.com", "text": "So I've been using a GoDaddy ssl certificate for my site for a couple\nof years and it's stopped working ever since upgrading to 2.2.8 (I\nthink I was 2.2.6 before).  The issue seems to be that Apache doesn't\nsend the intermediate signing certificate to the client which is necessary for the client to validate my site certificate as signed by a trusted CA.\n\nBasically my config looks like:\n\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n       ServerName www.synfin.net\n       DocumentRoot /var/www\n       SSLEngine On\n       SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM\n       SSLCertificateFile <path to cert>\n       SSLCertificateKeyFile <path to key>\n       SSLCertificateChainFile <path to GoDaddy intermediate cert>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nI've debugged with wireshark & openssl s_client -showcerts and it's\ncorrectly sending the ServerCertificate, but the certificate stored in\nthe intermediate is not sent, hence there's no trusted signing path.\nTurning on debug logging, I do see:\n\n[Tue Apr 08 12:33:30 2008] [debug] ssl_engine_init.c(664): Configuring\nserver certificate chain (1 CA certificate)\n\nWhich seems to indicate that it's loading the intermediate certificate file, but\nI'm at a loss beyond that. \n\nFeel free to test https://www.synfin.net/", "id": 115467, "time": "2008-04-09T11:26:58Z", "bug_id": 44789, "creation_time": "2008-04-09T11:26:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44789, "attachment_id": null, "id": 146981, "time": "2011-06-09T05:18:33Z", "creator": "ktdreyer@ktdreyer.com", "creation_time": "2011-06-09T05:18:33Z", "is_private": false, "text": "$ openssl s_client -connect www.synfin.net:443 -showcerts < /dev/null \n\nCONNECTED(00000003)\ndepth=3 L = ValiCert Validation Network, O = \"ValiCert, Inc.\", OU = ValiCert Class 2 Policy Validation Authority, CN = http://www.valicert.com/, emailAddress = info@valicert.com\nverify return:1\ndepth=2 C = US, O = \"The Go Daddy Group, Inc.\", OU = Go Daddy Class 2 Certification Authority\nverify return:1\ndepth=1 C = US, ST = Arizona, L = Scottsdale, O = \"GoDaddy.com, Inc.\", OU = http://certificates.godaddy.com/repository, CN = Go Daddy Secure Certification Authority, serialNumber = 07969287\nverify return:1\ndepth=0 O = www.synfin.net, CN = www.synfin.net, OU = Domain Control Validated\nverify return:1\n\nLooks like it's properly sending the chain... please re-open if you experience the same problem."}]
