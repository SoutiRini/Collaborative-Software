As presently implemented, apr_password_validate() instead fall out and uses an uninitialized char array in a string comparison.  The nested conditional statement appears to a programming error.  I've attached a patch that I think adjusts the conditional statements appropriately."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54603, "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for the patch.\nFixed in r1449308 for apr trunk and r1449309 for apr 1.5.x.\nWill be part of 1.5.2.", "id": 165451, "time": "2013-02-23T12:25:17Z", "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2013-02-23T12:25:17Z", "attachment_id": null}]
