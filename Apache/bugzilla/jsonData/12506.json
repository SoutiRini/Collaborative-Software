Restarting Apache BSODs Windows \nwith above message, created after using Windbg instructions to change registry \nto better identify error onscreen during dump. Apache site hints of similar \nproblem with WinXP, supposedly fixed by MS. No such fix for Win2K; still using \nAFD.SYS 5.00.2195.4667. Going back to unlimited MaxRequestsPerChild and higher \nthan recommended ThreadsPerChild seems to reduce frequency but not eliminate. \nAlso running ZoneAlarm 3.1.291. At one point seemed to be an outside chance of \na correlation (an hour way, plus or minus) with some sort of worm attack noted \nin logs (attempt to go after non-existent MSIIS scripts directories), but that \nseems less correlated now.
