Sorry it has taken so long to get round to it.\n\nThere is a slight problem with using File().length() - on some platforms it \nmay return a different value from counting the data bytes in the file. \n\nE.g. on OpenVMS it returns a larger number for text files.\n[This is because VMS normally uses variable length records for these, and the \nrecord size prefix is included in the file size]\n\nI've updated the code to use the Content-Length header if present:\n-1 = use chunked\n0 or missing = use File.length\nelse = use the header value as the length\n\nThis should cover all possibilities...\n\nIt will be in the next nightly build at:\n\nhttp://people.apache.org/builds/jakarta-jmeter/nightly/\n\nNote: the Content-Length should not be added by the user, so I've suppressed \nit in the underlying HttpClient sampler.", "bug_id": 39827, "attachment_id": null, "id": 99031, "time": "2007-02-06T15:12:41Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-02-06T15:12:41Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
