It is not possible to add\nevery useful task into Ant's core and optional tasks. In fact, we would argue\nthat there are already too many tasks in the main Ant distribution, tasks which\nare difficult to maintain because committer resources in scarce in the more\nesoteric areas.\n\nWe are at present happy to have tasks maintained external to Ant, such as those\nfrom ant-contrib. The core of Ant will mostly concentrate on features where the\nsupporting classes are provided directly by the JDK. Optional tasks provided\nwith Ant will be those where there is significant committer support (CVS tasks\nwould be an example).\n\nThere are various exceptions to these principles but these are generally a\nresult of historical quirks."}]
