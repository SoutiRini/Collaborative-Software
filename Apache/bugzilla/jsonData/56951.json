We've been running this patch in FreeSWITCH's version of APR for years and would like to see it included upstream if possible.  Please let us know your thoughts and if any changes are appropriate we'll be happy to make them and propose a revised patch.\n\nThe patch series being proposed here is also available on the master branch of this repository:\n\n  https://github.com/traviscross/apr/\n\nAuthor: Anthony Minessale <anthm@freeswitch.org>\nDate:   Fri Mar 14 01:35:26 2014 +0500\n\n    Add apr_queue_pop_timeout()\n    \n    This function will pop or get an object from the queue, blocking if\n    the queue is already empty for up to N microseconds.\n    \n    Signed-off-by: Anthony Minessale <anthm@freeswitch.org>\n    Signed-off-by: Travis Cross <tc@traviscross.com>", "id": 177712, "time": "2014-09-10T18:53:58Z", "creator": "tc+asf@travislists.com", "creation_time": "2014-09-10T18:53:58Z", "attachment_id": 31992}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ylavic.dev@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 181818, "time": "2015-03-16T17:35:47Z", "bug_id": 56951, "creation_time": "2015-03-16T17:35:47Z", "text": "Thanks, committed in r1667073 (+ r1667075 for credits), including both apr_queue_timedpop() and apr_queue_timedpush() (names maybe more consistent with other APR timed functions), and also factoring existing code (to avoid duplication).\n\nThey are good candidates for APR-1.6."}]
