[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "carl@convio.com", "text": "Basically, JMeter gets confused (adds query string parameter copies) when an\nHTTPSampler is used to get a page that redirects more than once.  This occurs\nreliably on JMeter version 1.9.RC2 running on Java version 1.4.2.\n\nReproduction Scenario\n \nUse Jmeter to call the test servlet (attached) with a ?redirect=<number> query\nstring where <number> is greater than 2.  The servlet will count down the number\nof redirects specified and finally render a basic HTML message.\n\nJMeter's response to this is interesting.  Each subsequent time the HTTPSampler\nis called (for a single thread in a Thread Group or Controller that loops), the\nattributes in the query string are DOUBLED, then TRIPLED, etc.  This can be\nobserved using the View Results Tree \"Results Window\".  Plus, the values of the\nattributes are not reset to that specified in the HTTPSampler.  Instead they are\nthe last values obtained from the final redirect of the last loop iteration.\n\nIn our case, servlets do this depending on varying circumstances.  The result is\nthat the integrity of the JMeter tests is unreliable thereafter.  While this is\na blocking problem for us, I'll just leave it at sev=major.\n\nAn accompanying jmx file is attached along with a JmeterTest.java servlet.", "count": 0, "id": 40769, "time": "2003-07-15T22:02:28Z", "bug_id": 21626, "creation_time": "2003-07-15T22:02:28Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21626, "attachment_id": 7316, "is_private": false, "id": 40770, "time": "2003-07-15T22:03:29Z", "creator": "carl@convio.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-15T22:03:29Z", "text": "Created attachment 7316\njmx file for reproduction scenario"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21626, "text": "Created attachment 7317\nJava servlet for the reproduction scenario", "id": 40771, "time": "2003-07-15T22:04:43Z", "creator": "carl@convio.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-15T22:04:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 7317}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "mstover1@apache.org", "text": "I just checked in some code to fix this.
