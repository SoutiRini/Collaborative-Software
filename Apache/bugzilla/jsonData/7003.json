[{"text": "This bug is intended as a \"property exposed through the usermodel\" checklist. \nThese are things not specifically mentioned in the Vision Document (like\nformulas and graphing were).  Lots of interest lately in getting involved and\nthis is the place to start.  Probably best to buy the book ( its out of print\nbut readily available -- I got one for $14.88 off of Amazon.com) and pick\nsomething to work on.  As features are completed/etc please update this bug with\na one liner comment like \"#1 done\"...  BOOK = \"Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's\nkit\" isbn: 1-57231-498-2\n\nThese properties we should endevour to cover in the 2.0 release and expose via\nthe high-level model:\n\n1 Backup - whether to save backup versions of the XLS (p287)\n2 Bottom Margin - inches margin when printing (p 290)\n3 Codepage - (p 293 and others)\n4 Footer - (p 317)\n5 Horizontally Center - (p320)\n6 Header - (p321)\n7 HyperLink - (p-321) Stores a hyperlink -- need to learn how they save it (undoc'd)\n8 Left Margin (p326) - width of the left margin in inches when printing\n9 NAMEs (p320) - defines a name of a cell\n10 Precision - (p372) - lets the user pick precision as displayed or not\n11. Print gridlines - (p373) - lets user pick to turn gridlines on or off\n12. Print Headers - (p373) - lets user turn on/off row/col headings\n13. Right Margin (p376) - size of the right margin in inches\n14. Selection (p384) - Cell selections\n15. Top margin (p413) - Top Margin in inches when sheet is printed \n16. Cented between vertical margins (p420)\n\n\nThese major features should be endevoured to support for the 2.0 release:\n\n17 Increased support for MULBLANK/MULRK records - Requires a restructuring of\nhow HSSF handles cell values or an adapter class (probably the best way).  \n\n18 Write support for RK records.\n\n19 Custom Cell number formats \n\nLeast likely (But never hurts to strive):\n\n20 Custom Palettes (p369) - Excel lets you monkey around with custom pallettes.\n Might be good to support.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 7003, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 11613, "time": "2002-03-09T20:14:11Z", "creator": "poi-support@buni.org", "creation_time": "2002-03-09T20:14:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7003, "attachment_id": null, "text": "4,6 are done", "id": 17453, "time": "2002-06-09T03:28:08Z", "creator": "poi-support@buni.org", "creation_time": "2002-06-09T03:28:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "#2, #8, #13, #15 done\n#11 done", "tags": [], "bug_id": 7003, "attachment_id": null, "count": 2, "id": 19937, "time": "2002-07-21T23:37:06Z", "creator": "shawn.laubach@b1b.tinker.af.mil", "creation_time": "2002-07-21T23:37:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "poi-support@buni.org", "text": "That leaves these opportunities: \n\n1 Backup - whether to save backup versions of the XLS (p287)\n3 Codepage - (p 293 and others)\n5 Horizontally Center - (p320)\n7 HyperLink - (p-321) Stores a hyperlink -- need to learn how they save it (undoc'd)\n9 NAMEs (p320) - defines a name of a cell\n10 Precision - (p372) - lets the user pick precision as displayed or not\n12.
