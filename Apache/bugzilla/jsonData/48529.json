[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 24829\npatch created with Eclipse SVN/Team/Create Patch, relative to \"ant/core/trunk\" project\n\nThis patch adds a new formatter \"xml.suites\" similar to \"xml\" that will generate a similar XML report, but will take into consideration the TestSuite hierarchy. It also ontains a report formatter that generates a nice html report from the xml (similar to \"noframes\").\n\nThe patch is relative to SVN ant/core/trunk, contents of today (close to 1.8.0RC1 release). I developed it on 1.7.1 source code, but merged it today to trunk so it's easier to integrate (but didn't test it on trunk after merge).\n\nI didn't have time to modify any documentation for this new formatter/reporter.\nHere is a sample of how the new task would be used:\n\n<junit ...>\n    <classpath refid=\"...\" />\n    <formatter type=\"xml.suites\" />\n\n    <test name=\"...\" todir=\"...\" />\n</junit>\n<junitreport todir=\"...\">\n    <fileset dir=\".\">\n        <include name=\"TEST-*.xml\" />\n    </fileset>\n    <report format=\"noframes-suiteaware\" todir=\"...\" />\n</junitreport>\n\nHope you can add this soon.\n\nRegards,\nAndrei Costescu", "attachment_id": 24829, "id": 133545, "creator": "costescuandrei@skymail.ro", "time": "2010-01-12T05:10:23Z", "bug_id": 48529, "creation_time": "2010-01-12T05:10:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "costescuandrei@skymail.ro", "attachment_id": 24830, "is_private": false, "id": 133546, "time": "2010-01-12T05:22:25Z", "bug_id": 48529, "creation_time": "2010-01-12T05:22:25Z", "text": "Created attachment 24830\nbinary file that wasn't included in text patch (but mentioned and needed)"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48529, "text": "Created attachment 24831\nbinary file that wasn't included in text patch (but mentioned and needed)", "id": 133547, "attachment_id": 24831, "creator": "costescuandrei@skymail.ro", "creation_time": "2010-01-12T05:22:44Z", "time": "2010-01-12T05:22:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "costescuandrei@skymail.ro", "attachment_id": 24834, "id": 133567, "time": "2010-01-13T02:43:13Z", "bug_id": 48529, "creation_time": "2010-01-13T02:43:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 24834\nA new version of this xsl to avoid wrapping in \"Name\" column that would result in an ugly tree when long test names/deep trees are used.
