Even worse: \nCGI.pm 2.79 url() method works fine because it doesn't use this variable, but \nCGI.pm 2.80 upwards does thus it produces bad URIs.\n\nIf you cache the pages that you dynamically generate, it basically means that a \nbroken client could break these pages for everyone.", "id": 16323, "time": "2002-05-17T12:05:04Z", "bug_id": 9201, "creation_time": "2002-05-17T12:05:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "text": "mod_setenvif specials have nothing to do with mod_cgi.\n\nAnyway, the REQUEST_URI environment variable is not specified in the CGI/1.1\ndraft, so there's no reason to change the behaviour (in fact, it appears to be\nmore useful than the pure URL path).
