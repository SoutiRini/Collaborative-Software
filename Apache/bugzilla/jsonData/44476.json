And there\nis no mentioning in the docs or the httpd.conf itself that Windows network\nshould not be used when starting Apache as a service during boot time.\n\nI am just suggesting to add the \"Browser\" dependency per default at installation\ntime and all cases (network - no network) would be handled \"out of the box\"\nwithout fiddling around with the registry.\nOr we put something up in the docs like: \"Windows network not supported when\nusing Apache as a service.\"\nRight now it's a real and really time wasting bug."}, {"count": 3, "text": "The right answer doesn't seem to be adding the Browser service, in fact there\nare no Windows services which depend upon that service starting.
