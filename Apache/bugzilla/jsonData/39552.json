It would be nice to see most of them included the\ndistribution.\n1. a new worker parameter: socket_nodelay, default 1 2. parameter\nsocket_timeout: the documentation stated that if the parameter was set to zero\nit would wait infinitely, however, the code\nsays: if it is set larger than zero, change it, i.e. if it were set to zero the\nsystem default would be used. The new implementation is: If it is set to -1 the\nsocket timeout is set to infinitely. If it is set to larger or equal to zero,\nthe socket timeout is set to the given value in seconds. Any other value will\nuse the system default.\n3. The status worker has a new button, that reloads the configuration.\nThis allows one to change the filter settigns without having to restart IIS.\nThis feature is not tested thoroughly, e.g. we have to make sure that all\nincoming requests are stalled and all active requests are served until the\nconfiguration is reloaded.\n4. Errors in WriteClient() are ignored, see\nhttp://west-wind.com/weblog/posts/1266.aspx\n5.
