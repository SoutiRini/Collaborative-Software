And there is a class in my project that inherits from it.\n\nI removed the \"final\" modifier and rebuilt the library. Now I have a new problem :\nthe new class \"org.apache.poi.hssf.model.InternalWorkbook\" is not found when building but when I replace it by \"org.apache.poi.hssf.model.Workbook\" there is no problem.\n\nWhat is strange is that \"Workbook\" class is no longer exists in POI 3.7 because renamed \"InternalWorkbook\".\n\nI would ask if it is a common problem or if there is a possibility to resolve it.\n\nYours sincerely."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51397, "text": "hssf.model.Workbook was renamed to avoid confusion.
