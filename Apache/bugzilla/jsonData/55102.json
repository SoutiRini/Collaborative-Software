This is the total processing time and may be affected by network conditions. It is sometimes useful to be able to record the time taken by the server to prepare the response and send the first content to the client.\n\nAttached is a patch that records the time the response is committed and then allows that to be reported in the access log using a '%F' pattern (which is the same as used by the mod-log-firstbyte module for HTTPD).", "id": 167832, "time": "2013-06-15T17:09:47Z", "creator": "jboynes@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-06-15T17:09:47Z", "attachment_id": 30438}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "jboynes@apache.org", "text": "Related post on users list:\nhttp://markmail.org/thread/vq3n2igy7q5fttc4", "count": 1, "id": 167833, "time": "2013-06-15T17:10:14Z", "bug_id": 55102, "creation_time": "2013-06-15T17:10:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55102, "text": "Generally the patch looks good to me.\n\nIt is missing documentation.
