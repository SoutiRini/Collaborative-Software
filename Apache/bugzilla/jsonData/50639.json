You may use Cameron's nightly builds [1], if the official ones and/or checking out from SVN and building from scratch doesn't feel comfortable enough. ;-)\n\n\n> BR,\n> Eduardo Ellery\n\nCheers,\n Helder\n\n\n[1] http://mcc.id.au/batik-nightly/", "id": 144127, "time": "2011-02-10T06:23:34Z", "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-02-10T06:23:34Z", "is_private": false}]
