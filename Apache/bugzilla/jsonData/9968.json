[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9968, "text": "Section 7.5 of the JSTL specification states:\n\n\"...[A]an implementation must prepend the context path to a URL that starts with\na slash (e.g. \"/page2.jsp\") so that such URLs can be properly interpreted by a\nclient browser.\"\n\nTo me, this implies that prepending ought not be done to a URL that does not\nstart with a slash (a page relative URL).  Yet the c:url tag prepends the\ncontext path, and any context relative path information, to the URL, converting\n\"somepage.jsp\" into \"/context/path/somepage.jsp\".  Though I can definitely see\nuses for this, I'm not entirely sure this is the desired effect.  It would\ncertainly be useful to be able to get at the page relative URL (\"sompage.jsp\")\nafter having rewritten the URL with parameters and a session ID, if necessary. \nThis would allow for the URL to be later used (e.g., conditionally) by\nc:redirect.  Currently, using the generated URL in c:redirect redirects to\n\"/context/context/path/somepage.jsp\", which of course does not exist as the\ncontext path has been prepended twice.", "count": 0, "id": 18005, "time": "2002-06-18T20:39:25Z", "creator": "jdpierce75@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2002-06-18T20:39:25Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bayern@essentially.net", "attachment_id": null, "id": 19511, "time": "2002-07-15T00:40:26Z", "bug_id": 9968, "creation_time": "2002-07-15T00:40:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Indeed, this was a bug.
