This patch fixes these errors by\n  - adding a check for RAND_egd and SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain\n  - make Apache pick up the SSL_NO_COMP define (OpenSSL sets OPENSSL_NO_COMP)\n  - using an already available define for CHIL\n  - using defines for the added checks\n\nSee https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57375 for the 2.4 patch", "attachment_id": 32331, "bug_id": 57395, "id": 180021, "time": "2014-12-24T18:39:15Z", "creator": "brnrd@freebsd.org", "creation_time": "2014-12-24T18:39:15Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This applies to mod_ssl in all Apache httpd releases, so please do not file a separate issue for 2.2.x (as explained on http://httpd.apache.org/dev/guidelines.html, such patches are developed for trunk and then backported to maintenance branches).\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 57375 ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 180254, "creation_time": "2015-01-11T11:57:24Z", "time": "2015-01-11T11:57:24Z", "creator": "asfbugz@velox.ch", "bug_id": 57395, "is_private": false}]
