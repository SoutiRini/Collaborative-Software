While\nit is straightforward to do this by hacking catalina.sh, this seems a bit\nmessy. I would like to suggest that the standard distribution of catalina.sh\nbe modified to include lines of this form:\n\n if [ x\"$AUX_CLASSPATH\" != \"x\" ]; then\n   CLASSPATH=${AUX_CLASSPATH}:\"$CLASSPATH\"\n fi\n \nafter the call to setclasspath.sh.\n\nThis would allow isolation of this app-specific CLASSPATH stuff, and ease\nthe admin's task as new servlets are added. An example of this is shown\nat http://www.ccgb.umn.edu/~crow/docs/catalina-sh.txt.\n\nThanks!"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13942, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 26399, "time": "2002-11-15T17:59:13Z", "creator": "crow@ccgb.umn.edu", "creation_time": "2002-11-15T17:59:13Z", "text": "All things considered, it probably would make more sense to flip \nthings around and append, instead of prepend, the information.
