I then added cookies=\"false\" and restarted my \napplication.\n\nUnfortunately, my simple JSP test (that shows sessions) indicated that it was \nreusing an existing session (instead of creating a new one each time).  My JSP \nwas not rewriting the URL, so that's not what I expected.\n\nIf I put this test JSP page into the examples context and set cookies=false for \nthat context, the application worked properly.\n\nI wasn't sure whether the default context was properly being handled for 4.0.4-\nB3 or an explicit DefaultContext tag is needed for this to work.  Your \ndocumentation seems to indicate both options.\n\nThanks,\nGlenn"}, {"count": 1, "text": "I have tested this with the latest version of TC4 and this works for me. There \nare a few points worth noting:\n- if you edit server.xml you need to restart tomcat to see the changes;\n- if you had cookies enabled, you need to close and reopen your browser \notherwise the browser will continue to send the cookie and the session will be \nreused.", "bug_id": 11867, "attachment_id": null, "id": 50211, "time": "2004-01-07T22:40:36Z", "creator": "medthomas@ntlworld.com", "creation_time": "2004-01-07T22:40:36Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
