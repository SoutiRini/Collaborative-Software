I've used <a name=\"...\"></a> style rather than adding id attributes to headers, as this style seems to be used elsewhere in the docs (specifically, I've based this on the selectors.html page).\n\n(There was actually an anchor already for the `os` condition, but none of the others).", "count": 0, "id": 146386, "time": "2011-05-17T16:38:35Z", "bug_id": 51213, "creation_time": "2011-05-17T16:38:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51213, "attachment_id": null, "id": 146599, "time": "2011-05-24T18:41:45Z", "creator": "jglick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-05-24T18:41:45Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Committed in revision 1127211.
