The Mapper re-uses the same code for host, context and context version selection. The code has been carefully tuned over the years.\n\nThe cleanest implementation I can come up with is an option to specic a custom version comparator for a host and then have the Mapper use the custom comparator for the context version if provided. Even that will be a little messy and end-users would have to be very careful with the comparator implementation to ensure a) it gave the desired results and b) it was performant.\n\nGiven the difficulties, I'm going to resolve this as WONTFIX since I think it is very unlikely that a patch will be produced.
