It appears that when this happens the thread ends immediately but\nno messages are written to the log.  I believe this is due to a thread overrun.\n The message buffer is being destroyed by the dying thread before it can write\nthe messages.\n\nBy placing the appender/writer onto an independent thread it may be possible to\nallow the buffer to remain safe when the servlet thread dies.  I would be happy\nto help resolve problem, but I will need some help with getting started and some\nguidance along the way.", "id": 30125, "time": "2003-01-27T18:08:54Z", "creator": "brennan.w.stehling@jci.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-27T18:08:54Z", "is_private": false}]
