Add \"label\" attribute on checkout per request from Greg Frank - checks out a specific view label.\n\n2.  Add \"recursive\" attribute as in the deprecated <starteam> task.\n\n3.  Add \"forced\" attribute as in the deprecated <starteam> task and\n\navoid checking StarTeam statuses when true.\n\n4.  Make sure all exceptions are caught on execution and rethrown\n\nas build exceptions.\n\n5.  Fixed a bug (using the \"forced\" attribute) which were causing files to be incorrectly not checked out when a rootLocalFolder was specified because the StarTeam file statuses were being checked in relation to the default directory.  \n\n6.  Fixed a bug where files were deleted immediately after being checked out when a rootLocalFolder was specified because the task erroneously thought the file was not under starteam control."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "stevec@ignitesports.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 954\nCode and documentation changes for this patch", "id": 9152, "time": "2001-12-24T06:49:10Z", "bug_id": 5583, "creation_time": "2001-12-24T06:49:10Z", "attachment_id": 954}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5583, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed in CVS.
