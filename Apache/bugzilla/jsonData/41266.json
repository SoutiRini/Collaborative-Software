Because the two specific projects that spawned\nthis library use it to do XMLish things like SVG and XSL-FO, which is also fine;\nbut this library itself is not about XML and shouldn't be called XML graphics.\n\nI'm not sure what it shoudl be called: maybe just Apache Graphics Commons? Or\nperhaps  Apache Graphics Formats?
