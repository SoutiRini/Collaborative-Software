The 'main' part of the Apache tutorial starts at\nhttp://minitutorials.com/apache/apache_222_1.shtml and runs for 5 short pages.\nThere are other relevent sections involving for instance configuring PHP for\nApache etc - all of this based and kept up to date with the latest releases,\ncurrently 2.2.2, info is only ever any good if kept upto date.\n\nOn the other issue of 'microfonts' , are you on a MAC ? , Fonts are mainly em or\n% based, the site is tested in many browsers and screen resolutions and not\nreally had any complaints so far, but am really interested in knowing your\nscenario so I can correct this if need be.\n\nThanks\n\nGav...\n\n", "id": 91489, "time": "2006-07-22T12:54:53Z", "creator": "brightoncomputers@brightontown.com.au", "creation_time": "2006-07-22T12:54:53Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40094, "text": "The /misc/tutorials.html page has been removed from the docs in the 2.2 and trunk branches, so there \nseems little point in adding to a deprecated page.\n\nSaying that, we now have a wiki [1] and welcome introductory tutorials there, and might consider \ntranslating any such work for the main docs.
