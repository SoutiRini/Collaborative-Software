[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53703, "text": "DIO's database connector classes provide a uniform way for handling timestamps in SQL queries making easier to the programmer to write queries in which timestamps and datetime fields have to be compared or manipulated. To determine when a session has to be expunged delta time calculations are made by the Session class by comparing these information. Database connector classes have been using a sort of serial number made by composing the date and time as \"<year><month><day><hour><min><sec>\" in order to return timestamp on which differences could be done in a portable way. This approach works in a very loosely way since that serial number isn't incremented with constant increments all the time, getting bumps of at least 40 units when seconds complete a lap passing from \"...0059\" to \"...0100\". Session class has instead a number of documented properties which tell a session object after how many seconds (not just arbitrary counts) a session will be refreshed or removed from the tables.\n\nSqlite and Mysql have been fixed now. Postgresql will follow.  Someone who can be bothered fixing the Oracle connector class is wanted.", "id": 161316, "time": "2012-08-12T23:47:24Z", "creator": "mxmanghi@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-08-12T23:47:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53703, "attachment_id": null, "text": "fixed for all supported database connectors in 'trunk'", "id": 161449, "time": "2012-08-15T21:48:30Z", "creator": "mxmanghi@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-08-15T21:48:30Z", "is_private": false}]
