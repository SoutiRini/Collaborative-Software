I am trying to customize the report style for our company and project, while still keeping the default information layouts including system properties and output.\n\nThe problem I am running into is that when I use the styledir=\"[my style folder]\", I can drill down just like in the default junit-frames.xsl and view everything as before except the properties link on the Class->Tests page. Now, if I copy the same file into the Apache Ant etc folder (default location) and run the ant script with out the styledir=\"...\" option, it works fine. The data is in the unit report output, it just won't display in the html.\n\nWhy won't it work with a custom file using the styledir=\"...\" option? This apparently is broken, or am I just not finding it.", "id": 162182, "time": "2012-09-14T16:35:36Z", "creator": "mmiles@fhlbi.com", "creation_time": "2012-09-14T16:35:36Z", "is_private": false}]
