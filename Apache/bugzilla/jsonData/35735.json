Think of it as Production-, Beta-\nand Developer-WebApps. \n\nFrom time to time, we restart TC .\n\nIf we do, and the dev webapp is first who is accesed and for this loads it\nclasses, these classes are also used in the production web.\n\nfor 95% of the used classes in this three apps, code and class methodes\nare the same, as the jsps are the same too. \n\nOur Production web does not reload classes in the classpath for speed reasons.\nThe dev app does reload the classes. \n\nWe used TC3 before we switched to TC5 and TC3 did NEVER show this behaviour.\n\nWhat do you need from our server to investigate this?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35735, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 77289, "time": "2005-07-14T14:51:50Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-07-14T14:51:50Z", "text": "Please post on tomcat-user instead."}]
