[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23587, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I found slide resources problem when saving with\nwebdav many documents into slide. In Oracle there is a\nlimit of open cursors.\n\nWhen putting files with webdav there is used for this\noperation\norg.apache.slide.webdav.util.VersioningHelper. In\nfunction public void versionControl( String\nresourcePath ) throws SlideException\n\nthere is following code:\n \n// Copy properties VCR->VR\n297:            NodeRevisionContent rNrc =\ncontent.retrieve( sToken, rNrds, rNrd );\n\nStream from rNrc variable is not closed - it causes\nleak in Oracle cursor resources for connection. Of\ncourse slide design foreseen this inconvenience ;) so\nwe have ConnectIfNeededAndPossible function which is\nmaking new db connection if old is unuseful and that's\nhow it masks such errors (there can be more of such).\n\nSo I would propose to add to NodeRevisionContent class\nsuch method:\n\npublic void release() {\n            try {\n                if(reader != null) {\n                    reader.close();\n                }\n            catch(IOException ioe) {\n                  ioe.printStackTrace();\n            }\n            try {\n                if(inputStream != null) {\n                    inputStream.close();\n                }\n            }\n            catch(IOException ioe) {\n                    ioe.printStackTrace();\n            }\n    }\n\nIt closes resources associated with\nNodeRevisionContent. It should be called after each\ncall retrieving NodeRevisionContent from slide. It\nensures that system resoures are freed.\n\nI was able to find problem with Oracle resources,\nbecause I am using now own slide driver that only\nchecks presence of connection in isConnected function (see bug # 23586).", "id": 45034, "time": "2003-10-03T09:34:34Z", "creator": "pwalendziak@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-10-03T09:34:34Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Oracle store is no longer supported", "bug_id": 23587, "attachment_id": null, "id": 49322, "time": "2003-12-18T12:35:38Z", "creator": "ozeigermann@c1-fse.de", "creation_time": "2003-12-18T12:35:38Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
