The listeners are notified only when\nnew sessions are created. \n\nIf this is in fact by design, then is it possible to have an option to enable\nnotification when a node picks up existing session during startup? Because\nusually if an app requires such notification when new session are created, it's\nlikely that it also need such behavior when a new node joins in."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33782, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 81458, "time": "2005-10-20T08:52:56Z", "creator": "pr@objektpark.de", "creation_time": "2005-10-20T08:52:56Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 35916 ***"}]
