Determine the dependencies between build targets.  Create a report \nexplaining the reason for each dependency. \n5. Create Microsoft .NET project and solution files, on project file per build \ntarget, one solution file per package.\n6. Create make files for Linux.\n7. Create Visual SlickEdit workspace and project files for Linux, which use the \nLinux make files.\n8. Create Doxygen control files for each package, and for the whole set of \nsource code.\n9.
