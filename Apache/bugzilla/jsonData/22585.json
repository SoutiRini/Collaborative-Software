It contains B(/a/b) and C(/a/c).\n\nNormally, the listWebdavResources would return a list containing /a/b and /a/c.\nThe problem is that it returns 3 children, including itself (!) with the path\n/a/a. I tried to check if this resource exists using the method \"exists\", but it\nreturns \"true\". I then tried to filter the first child resource having the same\nname as A, but it also erases eventual chidren that have the same name. It looks\nlike the children are stored in a hash, indexed by their names.\n\nIs there a workaround for this?", "id": 43044, "time": "2003-08-20T12:05:19Z", "creator": "dan@sync.ro", "creation_time": "2003-08-20T12:05:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22585, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I believe this has to do with the use of the URIUtil.getName(href) in\nWebdavResource (line 1086 the last I checked).
