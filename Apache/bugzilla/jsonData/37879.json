In\nregisterSVGBridges() you check for fontInfo and linkTransform, that are not yet\nuninitialized while super(...) is executing in constructor... however since this\nfunction is called from super (BridgeContext) and it is STATIC.. this CODE will\nnever be called.\n\nThere is also no code for binding PDFTextPaineter like in 0.20.5. But I tried to\nbind it to the context in PDFSVGHandler but ended up with PDF with no text on\nSVG files.. however I must confess this PDF was 70% smaller :)\n\nPlease FIX it.. this is serious regression comparing to FOP 0.20.5.
