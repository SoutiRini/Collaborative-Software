This would allow for example to \nrecompile invalid database objects or clean up, no matter which target was\nchoosen.\n\nAnother way to accomplish this is to add \"forward\"-dependencies. A target \ncould specify forward dependencies, meaning another target should always \nfollow this target."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jan@materne.de", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 17973 ***", "id": 56468, "time": "2004-04-27T10:47:49Z", "bug_id": 28620, "creation_time": "2004-04-27T10:47:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
