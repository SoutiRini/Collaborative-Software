I guess that would indeed make the most sense, together \nwith a port of fox:destination to the trunk, but *as an extension* to deal with the PDF-renderer specific \nparameters (like zoom settings, open-in-new-window etc.)\n----\n\nJust some further clarifications on the above:\nIn essence, what is called an 'explicit destination' in PDF consists of a 'page' component and the page \nco-ordinates to jump to, optionally also zoom/magnification settings to use. The reference to the page \nand the co-ordinates can easily be derived from the area corresponding to a FO in the document. \nMaybe all that needs to be done here is change the PDFRenderers treatment of the existing 'internal \ndestinations' (?) If the internal-destination in the document doesn't need to be reachable from a \nlocation external to the resulting PDF, PDF's explicit-destinations and link-annotations would suffice. \nThat isn't always the case, hence iiuc the idea of changing the default behavior for *all* FOs with an id \nproperty, and that is where 'named destinations' step in: define a dictionary of all possible destinations \nin the document, so that they are per se always reachable from outside of the PDF.\n\nfox:destination could be used to allow renderer-specific configuration of the named destination, like \nzoom settings for the PDF-viewer app (maybe even usable by the AWTRenderer as well?).", "id": 81411, "time": "2005-10-19T21:49:40Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-10-19T21:49:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "nils@meiers.net", "attachment_id": 17196, "text": "Created attachment 17196\nsorry, wrong bug", "id": 83541, "time": "2005-12-12T03:29:24Z", "bug_id": 37157, "creation_time": "2005-12-12T03:29:24Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 105420, "creation_time": "2007-07-14T01:29:44Z", "time": "2007-07-14T01:29:44Z", "bug_id": 37157, "text": "\nCan this be closed?
