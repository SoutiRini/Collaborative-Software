The XML document I am validating my XML document \nagainst a Schema, and this problem does not appear to be present when \nvalidating against a DTD.\n\nHowever, when I validate against a DTD using version 2.0.0.alpha, I do receive \nan Exception java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: y\nafter the startDocument event fires and before the first startElement event \nfires (Separate bug report to be submitted)."}]
