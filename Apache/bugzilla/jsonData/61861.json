For the authentication database, we are using a local SQLite3 DB. The ldap provider is specified first in the list (AuthBasicProvider ldap dbd).\n\nWe ran the Apache Benchmark tool (ab) on a different server to check the speed at high load, using -n1000 and -c1000. The -A option was used to specify either valid LDAP credentials or valid credentials in the SQLite database.\n\nWhen valid LDAP credentials are used, there are no bad requests or errors in the log. When valid credentials in the SQLite database are used, however, there are sometime failed requests with messages in the error log similar to what is attached.\n\nWe should also note that when we just specify the dbd provider (AuthBasicProvider dbd), we haven't experienced any failed requests or errors in the log. We only see failed requests and errors when using both providers (AuthBasicProvider ldap dbd) with valid credentials for the dbd provider.\n\nPlease let me know if you require more information than what I've provided.\n\nThank you for your time and effort!"}]
