I attached truss to the process and reloaded the failing page. The apache log reports this:\n\n[Mon Aug 26 09:33:17 2013] [notice] child pid 11274 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)\n\nIn the attachement you find the output httpd gave before it crashed. I used this command to get the info from the process:\n\n# egrep '^11274:' /root/outfile\n\nThe page being loaded is a generated pdf which is generated with pdflib. Pdflib is loaded as a module together with the oci module. THe page can off course not be displayed because the process segments on this.\n\nMaybe I need to recompile some libs?\n\nCan anyone help me out?\n\nKas", "id": 169704, "time": "2013-08-26T10:19:23Z", "creator": "kascoenen@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-08-26T10:19:23Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 30762}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 30762, "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 169709, "time": "2013-08-26T12:32:26Z", "bug_id": 55482, "creation_time": "2013-08-26T12:32:26Z", "tags": [], "text": "Comment on attachment 30762\ntruss from httpd after segmentaion fault\n\nYou'll need to get a core and run pstack on it.
