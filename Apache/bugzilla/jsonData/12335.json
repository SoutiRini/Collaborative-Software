This method (getPrinicipal()) is used by the RealmBase class when it \nauthenticates using the X509Certificate authenticate method. \n\nThe fix would be to do something similar to what mod_authz does and look up the \nDN (which is passed to the getPrincipal() method) to look up the user in the \nLDAP store and then verify that the account has not expired. This would map the \nremote user, I believe it will also allow the roles methods to work."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 7831 ***", "is_private": false, "id": 22367, "creator": "usyyid@storetrax.com", "time": "2002-09-06T15:27:11Z", "bug_id": 12335, "creation_time": "2002-09-06T15:27:11Z", "attachment_id": null}]
