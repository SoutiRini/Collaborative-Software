(We needed the content of a file in a variable.) It is a simple redesign of the StringFromFile function that reads just one line at a run.\n\nIt would be nice to see it the function in the offical version. I'm not sure about all the details of the functions behavior ... maybe one could make it a bit more efficent / safer. (Critics welcome )\n\nregards\nAndre"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "Thanks for the patch.\n\nI've applied a simplified version in the following SVN update:\n\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=804152&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 47565 - [Function] FileToString", "count": 1, "id": 129684, "time": "2009-08-14T03:06:57Z", "bug_id": 47565, "creation_time": "2009-08-14T03:06:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47565, "attachment_id": null, "id": 132260, "time": "2009-11-23T13:47:28Z", "creator": "soumen.sarkar@nokia.com", "creation_time": "2009-11-23T13:47:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please also take a look at bug 45174\n\nTCPSampler support for sending files\nhttps://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45174"}]
