There maybe something I'm missing, but as far as I know the simplest answer is no, it's not possible to create a PDF whose version is < 1.3. Why? Because FOP hasn't been designed to be able to control the PDF version of the output. As such, there is too much that is hard-coded to be able to produce PDF versions < 1.4 without a significant effort in development.\n\nHowever, producing pdfs > 1.4 is easy, simply because they're all backwards compatible. As such, all PDF versions 1.4 are also valid as PDF 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7. So in order to create greater PDF versions all I had to do was change a version header.\n\nHope that helps"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52060, "is_private": false, "count": 3, "id": 150828, "time": "2011-10-21T17:08:22Z", "creator": "willi.firulais@lycos.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-21T17:08:22Z", "text": "Thx a lot for your clear answer.\n\nWithout the Version 1.3 it will never be PDF/X-3:2002 complient (according to Acrobat Preflight) and therefore not suitable for usage in a professional printing process ;-(\n\nregards, Willi"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 150829, "time": "2011-10-21T17:27:51Z", "bug_id": 52060, "creation_time": "2011-10-21T17:27:51Z", "text": "Why so negative?
