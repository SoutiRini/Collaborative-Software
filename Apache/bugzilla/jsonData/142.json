[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 142, "attachment_id": null, "text": "When i process multipart/form data in my servlet, I need to read the input stream to parse the binary data. I use HttpUtils.parsePostData to do this. Note that I do not use getParameter on the HttpRequest anywhere after this(since that would definitely fail - I have emptied the input stream into my own data structures). But I need to forward this request to a JSP now. The JSP uses my data structures for the form parameters (that i have passed in as attribute in the HTTP request). It looks like internally, tomcat uses the getParameter call on the http request while invoking the dispatcher.forward, which in turn calls httpUtils.parsePostData , thus landing up with a short read !!\r\n\r\nIs there any way, the forward can happen with an empty input stream of parameters ?", "id": 122, "time": "2000-09-25T06:07:01Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2000-09-25T06:07:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 5339, "time": "2001-09-10T19:59:45Z", "bug_id": 142, "creation_time": "2001-09-10T19:59:45Z", "text": "I'm marking this as \"wontfix\" since it is logged against Tomcat 3.1.1.\nWithout an actual test case, it is hard to know if this particular problem\nis a bug and is still present in current Tomcat releases.
