The syntax of variable\nsubstitution is similar to that of Unix shells. The string between an opening\n\"${\" and closing \"}\" is interpreted as a key. The value of the substituted\nvariable can be defined as a system property or in the configuration file\nitself. The value of the key is first searched in the system properties, and if\nnot found there, it is then searched in the configuration file being parsed. The\ncorresponding value replaces the ${variableName} sequence. For example, if\njava.home system property is set to /home/xyz, then every occurrence of the\nsequence ${java.home} will be interpreted as /home/xyz.\"\n\n\nI am volunteering to complete this piece of work as I require this functionality\nfor an existing Ant property file.\n\n\nTim Telcik\ntelcik@iinet.net.au", "id": 44648, "time": "2003-09-25T08:15:23Z", "bug_id": 23405, "creation_time": "2003-09-25T08:15:23Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 23404 ***", "bug_id": 23405, "attachment_id": null, "id": 44649, "time": "2003-09-25T08:20:01Z", "creator": "jan@materne.de", "creation_time": "2003-09-25T08:20:01Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
