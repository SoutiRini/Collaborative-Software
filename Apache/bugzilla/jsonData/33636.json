This makes a proper cache handling quite difficult,\nbecause the if-modified-since header increases after deploying, even if the\nfiles in question haven't changed.\n\nThe attached simple patch changes the behaviour. It would be nice, if the patch\ncould be accepted at least as a configurable option. If so, I'd be ready to work\non more details and supply a larger patch later on.\n\nRegards,\n\nJochen", "id": 71193, "time": "2005-02-18T17:04:10Z", "creator": "jochen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-02-18T17:04:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33636, "text": "Created attachment 14315\nPatch setting the lastModified attribute on files being created by the ExpandWar class", "id": 71195, "time": "2005-02-18T17:04:51Z", "creator": "jochen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-02-18T17:04:51Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 14315}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33636, "is_private": false, "id": 2186, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-23T16:03:04Z", "time": "2005-03-23T16:03:04Z", "text": "Done for 5.5.9."}]
