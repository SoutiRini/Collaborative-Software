It looks like Tomcat 5.0\nchanges its jasper compiler so I'm using it to compile my jsp with ant.  The\nproblem is task JspC is using the verbose keyword with a numeric value.  This\nvalue is converted to -v{numericValue} who is passed the argument to jasper\ncompiler.  Tomcat 5.0's jasper compiler only support -v option without any\nnumeric value.  Since I'm using Tomcat 5.0, I cannot compile my jsp with Ant.\n\nSuggestion:\n- if keyword verbose isn't defined in JspC task, do not send -v option\n- allow verbose=\"\" to send a -v so this is backward compatible. Ex verbose=\"1\"\nwill sent -v1\n- add a new compiler value to JspC. Currently support jasper and jasper41,\nadding a jasper50 would be nice!"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 27923 ***", "is_private": false, "id": 55915, "creator": "stephane.houle@modesys.com", "time": "2004-04-16T18:39:23Z", "bug_id": 28439, "creation_time": "2004-04-16T18:39:23Z", "attachment_id": null}]
