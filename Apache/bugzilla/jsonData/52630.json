This happens at startup/reload time when ssl_engine_init.c:ssl_init_ctx_verify() calls ssl_init_FindCAList() to determine the list of acceptable DNs. mod_ssl then simply calls SSL_load_client_CA_file() for every file it finds, that's the reason for all these open() calls.\n\n> I also did the same strace, when specifying the absolute path\n> (/etc/grid-security/certificates/ ...\n> Basically the same seems to happen there,... same files read,.. same sizes...\n> just that the SSL handshake works.\n\nThe output of the open() calls provided in comment 9 has nothing to do with what happens when OpenSSL tries to verify the client cert if SSLCACertificatePath (but no SSLCACertificateFile) is configured. As I wrote in comment 8, it's the stat64() calls which will highlight the issue.\n\nIf you still maintain that this is not an issue with your particular\nconfiguration, then do this:\n\n1) shut down httpd\n\n2) close Firefox\n\n3) as root, execute\n\n. /etc/apache2/envvars && strace -fte stat64 /usr/sbin/apache2 -X 2>&1 |\ngrep \"stat64.*\\.0\"\n\n4) start Firefox, open the client-auth protected URL\n\n5) if \"Firefox can't access the SSL site\":\n\n   a) provide the output from the above shell command\n\n   b) provide the log messages from httpd's error log, but *only* for the\n      time shown in the above shell output", "is_private": false}, {"count": 11, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52630, "text": "Sorry Kaspar, I somehow missed the stat64 thingy.\n\nI'll do this immediately when I'm back from vacation (1st of March).
