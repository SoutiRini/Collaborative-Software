[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4111, "text": "When connecting to a Windows 2000 ftp server which has \"MSDOS\" style directory \nlisting (default), all operations with <ftp> task fail to work. This is \nespecially confusing on operations like \"get\" where you do not expect the task \nto do a directory listing (it does to implement fileset filtering). If the \nserver is configured for \"UNIX\" style directory listing, then everything works \nas expected. So, I don't think it is an issue with my build.xml (which I can \nattach if necessary).\n\nThe solution can be either mentioning this in the documentation (that ant ftp \ntask requires Unix style listing) or supporting Windows 2000 MSDOS style \nlisting by writing a FTPFileListParser that understands this listing format.", "id": 6600, "time": "2001-10-11T11:07:23Z", "creator": "katkere@praja.com", "creation_time": "2001-10-11T11:07:23Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "text": "The doc change is in there now; I'm leaving this report open as it does need \nfixing, ultimately.", "bug_id": 4111, "attachment_id": null, "id": 6863, "time": "2001-10-18T17:56:06Z", "creator": "steve_l@iseran.com", "creation_time": "2001-10-18T17:56:06Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
