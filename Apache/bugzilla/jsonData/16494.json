That all depends on the amount of time I can devote to this project and when that elusive \"next version\" will be released.

Wouldn't NetBeans benefit from precisely accurate information about each task such that those property inspectors can use that metadata to constrain booleans to checkboxes, drop-downs for EnumeratedAttributes, etc?
