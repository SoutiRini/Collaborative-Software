It creates undesirable effect and breaks a web application logic becuase only the first cookie will be created on a client's machine.\n\nI think, more logical solution would be to actually edit the cookie's values and not to delete the existing ones. I've modified the mod_header.c (see mod_headers2 attachment and 'replace_values' function) and tested the new module - it seems to be working, but you might want to verify the code.\n\nTo compile the new module use:\napxs -i -a -c -n headers2 mod_headers2.c\n\nNew directive names:\nHeader2 \nRequestHeader2\n\nTo load the new module use:\nLoadModule headers2_module    modules/mod_headers2.so", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 45952, "id": 121212, "time": "2008-10-05T16:56:03Z", "creator": "oleg@gryb.info", "creation_time": "2008-10-05T16:56:03Z", "attachment_id": 22674}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 45333 ***", "id": 121213, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 45952, "creation_time": "2008-10-05T19:35:09Z", "time": "2008-10-05T19:35:09Z", "is_private": false}]
