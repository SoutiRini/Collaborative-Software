Anti-patterns are counterparts of design patterns and are defined as mistakes during software development that produces negative consequences and is ineffective or counter-productive. During program execution, error events can occur that disrupts the normal flow of the program. Programming languages provide exception handling mechanism to developers for handling errors and exception events. \n\nI mined the source -code for automatically detecting 10 exception handling anti-patterns (https://today.java.net/article/2006/04/04/exception-handling-antipatterns).  In this issue report, I list the exception handling anti-patterns and code-smells that I found in the source code. My experimental results demonstrate presence of various exception handling anti-patterns and throw light on their intensity. I believe my tool for automatic detection of anti-patterns in source code and the attached results can be useful to programmers by helping them correct mistakes and write effective code."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": 31759, "text": "Created attachment 31759\nList of Exception Management Anti-Patterns and Code Smells\n\nThe text file size was more than 1000 KB and hence I have zipped it.", "id": 176086, "time": "2014-06-29T07:18:20Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T07:18:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "attachment_id": 31760, "text": "Created attachment 31760\nFILE 1 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "id": 176087, "time": "2014-06-29T07:46:40Z", "bug_id": 56681, "creation_time": "2014-06-29T07:46:40Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 31761\nFILE 2 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "attachment_id": 31761, "bug_id": 56681, "id": 176088, "time": "2014-06-29T07:47:58Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T07:47:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "text": "Created attachment 31762\nFILE 3 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "id": 176089, "time": "2014-06-29T07:49:24Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T07:49:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 31762}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "text": "Created attachment 31763\nFILE 4 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "id": 176090, "time": "2014-06-29T07:50:10Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T07:50:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 31763}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "attachment_id": 31764, "id": 176091, "time": "2014-06-29T07:51:02Z", "bug_id": 56681, "creation_time": "2014-06-29T07:51:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 31764\nFILE 5 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS"}, {"count": 7, "text": "Created attachment 31765\nFILE 6 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": 31765, "id": 176092, "time": "2014-06-29T07:51:55Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T07:51:55Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": null, "text": "See also Bug 56682 (JMeter) where I have made notes on some inconsistencies and problems in the report", "id": 176098, "time": "2014-06-29T12:31:49Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T12:31:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": 31768, "text": "Created attachment 31768\nFILE 1 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "id": 176105, "time": "2014-06-29T19:26:15Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T19:26:15Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 10, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": 31769, "text": "Created attachment 31769\nFILE 2 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "id": 176106, "time": "2014-06-29T19:26:58Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T19:26:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 11, "text": "Created attachment 31770\nFILE 3 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": 31770, "id": 176107, "time": "2014-06-29T19:27:33Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T19:27:33Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 12, "tags": [], "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "attachment_id": 31771, "id": 176108, "creation_time": "2014-06-29T19:28:09Z", "time": "2014-06-29T19:28:09Z", "bug_id": 56681, "text": "Created attachment 31771\nFILE 4 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "is_private": false}, {"count": 13, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": 31772, "text": "Created attachment 31772\nFILE 5 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS", "id": 176109, "time": "2014-06-29T19:28:49Z", "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "creation_time": "2014-06-29T19:28:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 14, "tags": [], "creator": "ashish@iiitd.ac.in", "attachment_id": 31773, "id": 176110, "time": "2014-06-29T19:29:28Z", "bug_id": 56681, "creation_time": "2014-06-29T19:29:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 31773\nFILE 6 \u2013 LIST OF ANTI-PATTERNS"}, {"count": 15, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56681, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please refer to https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56682#c9\n\nI have addressed all the comments/issues mentioned in the discussion thread (of Bug 56682) and fixed it (except the minor nit which also I will address soon).
