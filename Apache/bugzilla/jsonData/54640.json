[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54640, "text": "I've configured a reverse proxy with two workers with lbmethod=bybusyness\nGiven that the back-end servers are supporting only one single connection concurrently I've configured each member with max=1\n\nNow in a first connection to the server, I send a request to a resource that is going to take 20 seconds to respond.\nShort after, with a second connection I send a request to a resource that is going respond immediately. Everything looks fine.\n\nI send immediately a third request to retrieve the fast resource but I unexpectedly have to wait that the first request has finished before getting an answer to the third.\nI was expecting the 'bybusyness' algorithm to give priority to the non busy balancer member but instead it seems that it is queuing the third request to the one being busy.\n\nIs this behavior expected, should I confgiure somnething differently or can this be considered a bug?\n\nConfig snippet:\n<Proxy balancer://session>\n  BalancerMember http://10.10.1.1:26240 connectiontimeout=10 max=1\n  BalancerMember http://10.10.1.1:26241 connectiontimeout=10 max=1\n</Proxy>\n<VirtualHost 10.1.1.1:80>\n  KeepAlive On\n  ServerName session.example.ch\n  ProxyPass            /                balancer://session/ lbmethod=bybusyness\n</VirtualHost>\n\nTested on Apache vanilla 2.2.24, and Apache 2.2.16 distributed with Debian Squeeze.", "id": 165654, "time": "2013-03-05T14:41:52Z", "creator": "federico.mennite@lifeware.ch", "creation_time": "2013-03-05T14:41:52Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
