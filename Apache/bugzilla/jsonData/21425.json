Used the same http.conf file from my old web server.\nWhat appeared to be an Apache lockup happened daily, at sporadic times.  \nCouldn't peg it and had the log file full of the semaphore errors listed.\nAdded the \n\nWin32DisableAcceptEx\n\nwhich got rid of the errors, but Apache still sporadically just stopped \naccepting requests.\nWas almost to the point of turnign on my old server when I saw this above\n\nEnableSendfile Off \nenablemmap Off\n\nAdded both to the http.conf file 5 days ago. It may be too early to say but \nApache hasn't stopped yet.  I have no idea what those two settings are, but \nthey appear to work at this time\n\nThanks for the support given in this thread!", "attachment_id": null, "id": 70953, "creation_time": "2005-02-14T21:21:12Z", "time": "2005-02-14T21:21:12Z", "creator": "dkoudys@mountaincable.net", "bug_id": 21425, "is_private": false}, {"count": 56, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21425, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I just got a brand new server at servermatrix yesterday:\n\nCeleron 2.4\nWindows 2003 standart\nApache 2.0.53\nPHP 4.3.10\neAccelerator (latest CVS)\n\nToday I got on my log:\n\n[Sat Feb 26 12:27:16 2005] [warn] (OS 121)The semaphore timeout period has \nexpired.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 12:30:00 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 12:36:00 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 12:50:29 2005] [warn] (OS 121)The semaphore timeout period has \nexpired.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 12:50:32 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 12:50:32 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 12:50:38 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 12:50:41 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 13:29:59 2005] [warn] (OS 121)The semaphore timeout period has \nexpired.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 13:29:59 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 13:32:34 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 13:36:52 2005] [warn] (OS 121)The semaphore timeout period has \nexpired.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 13:37:03 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n[Sat Feb 26 13:38:57 2005] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer \navailable.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n\nThe server today was completely frozen after that.
