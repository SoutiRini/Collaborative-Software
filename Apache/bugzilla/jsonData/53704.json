[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "In the spirit of mod_vhost_ldap, and contrary to another bug report that requests a GUI, I am wondering whether any thought has been given to being able to maintain the entire HTTPD configuration in an LDAP directory, much as OpenLDAP allows its own configuration to be held inside the directory, to override the present forest of .conf and .htaccess files when so configured.\n\nThis has lots of advantages:\n\n1. The pre-existence of many LDAP browsers means that the GUI problem is solved at a stroke.\n\n2. Appropriate LDAP object and attribute schema classes would be defined for HTTPD configuration. That automatically provides automatic restriction of what can be specified where, and also automatic attribute-value syntax checking. Both would speed things up for web-admins considerably.\n\n3. It becomes possible to view the entire configuration as a tree, a view which you can presently only get to a limited extend via the server-info handler.\n\n4. As per OpenLDAP, configuration changes could take effect immediately rather than after a graceful or graceless restart. This is the part that would require the most re-engineering.\n\nI'm not at all familiar with the internals of Apache so I can't comment on the general feasibility of this suggestion.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 161320, "creator": "esmond.pitt@bigpond.com", "time": "2012-08-13T04:37:07Z", "bug_id": 53704, "creation_time": "2012-08-13T04:37:07Z", "is_private": false}]
