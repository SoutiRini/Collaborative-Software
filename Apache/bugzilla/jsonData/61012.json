I needed some time to identify the problem as there was no log message written. Also the status code 200 in the access_log was misleading.\n\nAfter studying the code I understood why mod_proxy_wstunnel never returns with HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT (\u00abAvoid sending error pages down an upgraded connection\u00bb). \n\nHowever, I think the module should at least write a log entry upon connection terminations.\n\nCheers,\n\nArmin", "id": 198399, "time": "2017-04-20T08:19:44Z", "bug_id": 61012, "creation_time": "2017-04-20T08:19:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61012, "attachment_id": null, "id": 198481, "time": "2017-04-23T21:28:06Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-04-23T21:28:06Z", "is_private": false, "text": "http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1792394&view=rev"}]
