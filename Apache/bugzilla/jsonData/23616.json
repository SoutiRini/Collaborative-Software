I have changed APR_SHELLCMD_ENV to\nAPR_PROGRAM_ENV in both places in log.c as suggested in #21 and it also works\nfor me. Among other things, the full filename of the executable has to be\nspecified in ErrorLog / CustomLog lines.\nThis used to work, but will not work anymore:\n    ErrorLog \"|bin/rotatelogs xxxx/logs/error_log_%Y%m%d.log 86400\"\nThis works:\n    ErrorLog \"|bin/rotatelogs.exe xxxx/logs/error_log_%Y%m%d.log 86400\"\n\nIs it possible to mark this bug as OPEN and attempt to fix this for the next\nrelease?", "attachment_id": null, "id": 99815, "creator": "JPlissonneauDuquene@bellhelicopter.textron.com", "time": "2007-02-26T12:14:30Z", "bug_id": 23616, "creation_time": "2007-02-26T12:14:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 27, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23616, "text": "I am quite curious, when or even if anybody will fix this issue.\n\nI see that this bug already exists for a long time (Apache 2.0.x and Apache \n2.2.x series). The way it was described by several Windows OS users exactly \nmatches my experiences on a Windows 2003 Server system.\n\nIf a software wants to be somewhat 'platform idependent', it should try to fix \na problem of that extent. It is not only that it is annoying to see a growing \nnumber of orphaned processes everytime you change your configuration, but a \nreally makes you angry, if the logs aren't continued for some reason, if the \nnumber of hanging processes has grown to much. And if you rely on log rotation \nfor log analysis, it can break your neck if it is part of a contract with an \nimportant customer.\n\nI really would appreciate that some of the developers may state that this is \nby design and the design will not change (hopefully not) or give it another \ntry...\n\nAnd hopefully there will not be any \"MS Windows bashing\" like \"use Linux, dumb \nmate\".
