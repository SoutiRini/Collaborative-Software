I'm finding it easier to create patches for CellFormat than for DataFormatter, and I agree with the comment on my previous patch (issue 54328) that CellFormat and DataFormatter should be merged in the longer term.)"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52708, "text": "Applied in r1294072\n\nI fully agree that CellFormat and DataFormatter should be merged in the\nlonger term and current divergence is not good.
