If B is still null when doStartTag is called, initialize\nit to a copy of A.  Reset B (to null) in the release method.  For debugging\npurposes, the tag should just print out the values of A and B, labeled.\n\nCreate a test page that calls the tag twice, neither time setting B, but both\ntimes setting A to different values (\"first time\" and \"second time\", for\nexample).  It should print something like the following:\n first time, first time\n second time, second time\nBut it will print the following:\n first time, first time\n second time, first time\n\nWorkaround: surround the doStartTag with a try/catch/finally, and call the\nrelease method in the finally block.\n\nNotes: this is probably platform independant - I've tested on Linux and WinXP.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 38888, "id": 86579, "time": "2006-03-07T20:23:56Z", "creator": "blinks@acm.org", "creation_time": "2006-03-07T20:23:56Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "blinks@acm.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 86580, "time": "2006-03-07T20:26:21Z", "bug_id": 38888, "creation_time": "2006-03-07T20:26:21Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The JSP page implementation class also guarantees that release will be invoked\non the tag handler ** before the end of the page **."}]
