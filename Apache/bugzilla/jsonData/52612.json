This account has extensive privileges on the local system and acts as the computer on the network.\n\nWould it not make more sense to run the Apache service under the LocalService account? This account has the same level of access to resources and objects as members of the Users group. This limited access helps safeguard the system if individual services or processes are compromised. Services that run as the Local Service account access network resources as a null session without credentials.\n\nInstalling under the LocalService account and setting file and folder permissions to read/execute at the top of the Apache folder tree, with read/write/execute at the log folder seems to work fine.\n\nInfo:\n\nhttp://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/sqlsecurity/thread/31d57870-1faa-4e14-8527-ce77b1ff40e4\n\nCheers,\n\nChris", "attachment_id": null}]
