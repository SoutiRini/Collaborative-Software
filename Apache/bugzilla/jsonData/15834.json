I did as it was explained in the docs, \nwich is really easy, thanks for that. But it didnt work. I always got the error \nmessage, that it could not connect to tomcat.\n\nThen I tried JK2 v 2.0.1 and it worked at once. Thus, I would think that it is \na bug in v 2.0.2.\n\nThank you very much for providing this Apache-Tomcat connectivity.\n\nYours \nThomas Janke", "id": 28937, "time": "2003-01-07T11:51:43Z", "creator": "thomas_janke@prisma-edv.de", "creation_time": "2003-01-07T11:51:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15834, "is_private": false, "text": "Should works in 2.0.4 release", "id": 52315, "time": "2004-02-16T08:25:20Z", "creator": "hgomez@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-02-16T08:25:20Z", "attachment_id": null}]
