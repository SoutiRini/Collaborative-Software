I try to use the ajp13 \ncommunication whenver possible, but found a possible problem when using ajp13 \nin combination with form uploads. The browser code will be something like:  \n\n<form enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=POST action='upload'>\n  <input type=File name=userFile size=30>\n  <input name=Submit type=submit value=Upload>\n</form>\n\nAnd on in the tomcat server I have a servlet mapped to the name 'upload'. (See \nhttp://www.servlets.com/resources/com.oreilly.servlet/ for help on servlet that \ncan receive multipart/form-data requests). \n\nWith ajp13, the upload hangs with the console being flooded with the 'Y' \ncharacter.
