Everything works fine \nwith the change.\n\nHope it is fixed soon.\n\nThanks,\n\nShouguan Lin", "id": 65793, "time": "2004-10-27T01:38:16Z", "bug_id": 31911, "creation_time": "2004-10-27T01:38:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31911, "attachment_id": null, "id": 65801, "time": "2004-10-27T06:36:43Z", "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "creation_time": "2004-10-27T06:36:43Z", "is_private": false, "text": "See Bug 14518."}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 31911, "text": "This should be fixed in 1.3.33 now.", "id": 66091, "time": "2004-10-29T15:55:40Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2004-10-29T15:55:40Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
