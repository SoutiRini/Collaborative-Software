In a web server directory, create a file called lizard\n2. Create the following .htaccess in that directory\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule frog lizard [T=image/gif]\n\n3. From a Web browser or header examining tool, request \n\nhttp://whatever/wherever/frog\n\nExpected result: The file 'lizard' is served, with MIME type of image/gif\nActual result: The file 'lizard' is served, with MIME type of text/plain (the\nserver's default)\n\nIf, rather than using an extensionless file, you try to serve a file that\nalready has a type by virtue of its extension (.html), then the file is served\nas text/html and still not as image/gif.\n\nI tested this on my shared hosting account (the only Apache I have access to) on\npair.com. Two other people also tried on their own different Apache\nconfigurations. (I did also post this to users@httpd.apache.org but nobody\nresponded.)\n\nFrankly I know very little about Apache, so I don't really know whether this is\na bug or not. \n\nJust incidentally (i.e. not part of the bug report but explains why I want it to\nwork), this functionality would be useful in order to serve XHTML files with the\nappropriate MIME type when using a browser which supports XHTML, but as\ntext/html otherwise, using the following:\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} application\\/xhtml\\+xml\nRewriteRule ^(.+)\\.html $1.html [T=application/xhtml+xml]\n\n(There are other ways to achieve the same thing but they involve ugliness such\nas making two copies or a symlink to the file, so it would be nice if this one\nworked.)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I've installed 1.3.23 and in my tests it works.\nI'd consider this a configuration issue. Please reopen the bug if it still and\nreproducable occurs.\n\nThanks for using Apache!", "attachment_id": null, "id": 31490, "creation_time": "2003-02-18T02:05:01Z", "time": "2003-02-18T02:05:01Z", "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "bug_id": 10108, "is_private": false}]
