Note, that there are two new\nfiles included in this patch. The first attachment (09/22/04 07:31) is obsolete.\n\nThis patch deals with the visibility of a node in the navigation (i.e. it will\nbe possible to hide nodes in the navigation as asked for by different users).\n\nA short description of the features included in this patch:\n- while creating a new document decide whether a document is visible in the\nnavigation.\n- A Node, which have not set the visibility attribute will be visible by default\n(compatibility to older versions).\n- A document which is not visible in the navigation is nevertheless visible in\nthe site area\n- The visibility attribute is passed to the live area\n- There is a menu entry to change the visibility\n- This change set the workflow state to authoring.\n\nI tested the solution in some detail. It would therefore be nice if one of the\ncommitters can check the code\nand if it is ok apply the patch to one of the next releases.\n\nLet me know if there are some questions cocerning this patch ....", "id": 65505, "time": "2004-10-22T14:31:26Z", "creator": "jann.forrer@id.unizh.ch", "creation_time": "2004-10-22T14:31:26Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31357, "text": "Created attachment 13188\nreplaces the first attachment from: 09/22/04 07:31", "id": 65506, "time": "2004-10-22T14:33:46Z", "creator": "jann.forrer@id.unizh.ch", "creation_time": "2004-10-22T14:33:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 13188}, {"count": 5, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 31357, "text": "Should this be included in 1.2.1?
