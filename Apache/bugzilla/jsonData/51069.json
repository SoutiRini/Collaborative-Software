But it could not find the RMIC references and threw the classnotfound exception during run time.\n\nAny pointers on same be apprecited. \n\nThanks,\nAby", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 51069, "id": 145801, "time": "2011-04-15T02:29:07Z", "creator": "singhabhinav2@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-04-15T02:29:07Z", "attachment_id": null}]
