But now we are saying 'but when some\ntargets fail they are special and should stop the keepgoing from continuing'. \n\nWho decides which actions break keepgoing, and which dont? You clearly think\n<fail>  is -and always will be- special. But what if (as I often do), the <fail>\nis merely a validation that some condition meets the requirements of a target,\nor validation that a task completed successfully. In these use cases, well, if I\nask for keepgoing then I would expect to keep going.\n\nAre we going to have to have a special tag on fail to say \"this is so important\nit always fails\"? How are we going to stop other tasks from throwing\nFatalBuildExceptions?\n\nIMO we either dont have a keep-going rule, or we have one that it simple and\nconsistent: no getout clauses, not even a little one.
