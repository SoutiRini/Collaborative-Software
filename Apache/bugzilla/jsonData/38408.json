If mod_include\nreferences one of these variables and if its value is LAZY_VALUE, then\nmod_include sets the variable to its actual value before using it.\n\nWhen SSI spawns processes via <!--#exec ... --> or\n<!--#include virtual= ... --> nothing is done to evaluate SSI variables\nthat are still set to LAZY_VALUE, so These variables end up in the\nenvironment of the spawned process with null string values.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a CGI program named foo.cgi that uses\nLAST_MODIFIED and suppose you have this in a html document:\n\n<!--#include virtual=\"foo.cgi\"-->    LAST_MODIFIED is the null string\n\n<!--#echo var=\"LAST_MODIFIED\"-->     mod_include evaluates LAST_MODIFIED\n\n<!--#include virtual=\"foo.cgi\"-->    Now LAST_MODIFIED has correct value"}]
