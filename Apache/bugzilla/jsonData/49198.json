These protocols are not 32Bit/64Bit aware. So you can mix and match between 32Bit and 64Bit Apache and Tomcat.\n\nUsually you need 64Bit because of more threads per process or because of more memory needed to handle the load. Since in the combination of Apache and Tomcat usually the most resource demanding aspect is running on the Tomcat part, you only need 64Bit processes for Tomcat, but not for Apache.\n\nAll common 64Bit operating systems support running a 32Bit binary without problems.\n\nSo I suggest you stick to 32Bit Apache but use 64Bit Tomcat.\n\nConcerning 64Bit Tomcat: Tomcat Core is pure Java, so you switch between 32Bit and 64Bit by simply switching the JVM.\n\nWhen running as a service on Windows or when including the so-called tcnative (alias APR connector) on any OS, you will add native code which is different between 32Bit and 64Bit. So for those parts you will need to retrieve the correct version.", "id": 136455, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2010-04-27T12:49:44Z", "time": "2010-04-27T12:49:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 137083, "time": "2010-05-24T18:34:59Z", "bug_id": 49198, "creation_time": "2010-05-24T18:34:59Z", "is_private": false, "text": "No point providing 64-bit mod_jk while there is no matching httpd 64-bit binary for Windows."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49198, "text": "*** Bug 50832 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 144548, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-02-25T15:16:42Z", "time": "2011-02-25T15:16:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 144550, "time": "2011-02-25T15:18:02Z", "bug_id": 49198, "creation_time": "2011-02-25T15:18:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 46802 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49198, "attachment_id": null, "text": "http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php has a x64 binary.
