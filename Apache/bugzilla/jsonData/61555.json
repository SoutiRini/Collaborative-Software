[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61555, "is_private": false, "text": "For Jmeter 3.2, the metaspace maximum size is not set by default in the Jmeter scripts.  This can lead to situations where tests will fail or start to slow after a large number of hours into the test, due to using up all available memory on the box and invoking paging.\n\nIt is preferable that Jmeter specify a default value for max metaspace to prevent this happening.  If my tests are going to fail it is better that they will fail early, rather than later and with a OOM metaspace, rather than showing degraded performance which may be assumed to be related to the app under test.\n\nI would leave it to the team to decide what the default max should be.  Obviously this might break some user's current tests so it will need to be highlighted in the release notes.  We currently restrict our Jmeters to 256mb on our 4GB boxes.", "id": 201023, "time": "2017-09-21T11:09:12Z", "creator": "be_strew@yahoo.co.uk", "creation_time": "2017-09-21T11:09:12Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Author: pmouawad\nDate: Thu Sep 28 19:19:03 2017\nNew Revision: 1810036\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1810036&view=rev\nLog:\nAdd MaxMetaspaceSize\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/bin/jmeter\n    jmeter/trunk/bin/jmeter.bat", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 61555, "id": 201759, "time": "2017-10-28T14:45:35Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2017-10-28T14:45:35Z", "is_private": false}]
