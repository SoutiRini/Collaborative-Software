So we added a 'SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \"\\.pdf$\" no-gzip'\ndirective in our configuration file, and it was working fine so far.\n\nBut we are now experiencing some problems with a website where PDFs are created\non-the-fly by a Servlet. The requested URI doesn't contain \".pdf\" anymore, and\nthe SetEnvIfNoCase directive doesn't match.\n\nI didn't find a way to specify an exclusion based on the Response MIME type\n(application/pdf), except with the AddOutputFilterByType directive, but this one\nisn't working with proxy requests (we are using mod_rewrite to forward requests\nto the Application Server).\n\nCould you help us with this issue ? Maybe should 'SetEnvIf...' be available for\nResponse Headers too, or maybe AddOutputFilterByType should work for proxy\nrequests, or maybe we need a new directive here...\n\nThank you very much.\n\nRegards,\n\nThomas Castelle"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36605, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This is already provided for.
