Then noticed that http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-\ndoc/config/logger.html says that <Logger>s are deprecated in 5.5.  Did not \ninitially see this, as I switched to reading the 5.5 pages when I upgraded \nfrom 5.0 - could the same warning be added to 5.5 pages please, I think this \nwould mean more people would see it.\n\nAlso could the disappearance of <Logger>s in 5.5 be added to an \"upgrading to \n5.5\" page, along with other issues, and/or the 5.5 release notes?  Again, this \nmight help more people to find the info quicker."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 35055, "is_private": false, "id": 75700, "time": "2005-06-01T04:37:18Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2005-06-01T04:37:18Z", "tags": [], "text": "The Tomcat 5.0 Logger page is very clear.
