I was following the Apache\nTutorial: Dynamic Content with CGI at \nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/cgi.html\nIt contains a troubleshooting section (But it's still not working! -->  The\nsource code of your CGI program or a \"POST Method Not Allowed\" message).  This\nis exactly the error I was getting for quite a while; when loading the cgi\nscript, I saw only the source code of the script, never the output.  The\ntutorial suggested that my config was wrong, so I spent a long time trying\ndifferent variations of my Directory, Alias, ScriptAlias, AddHandler, and\nOptions directives.  Nothing worked.\n\nIn the end, the fix was to uncomment the LoadModule cgi_module, which was\ncommented out by default.  I don't know if that's apache's default configuration\nor Gentoo's.  Either way, I know it's obvious, but it took me a long time to\nfind that obvious solution.  It would be helpful if the troubleshooting section\ncontained a sentence saying to make sure that you have your LoadModule\ncgi_module line uncommented."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41517, "attachment_id": null, "id": 104249, "time": "2007-06-08T18:42:42Z", "creator": "davi@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-06-08T18:42:42Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This seems more like a configuration problem.If more information appears\nlater, please re-open the bug."}]
