Didn't go crazy because all the Tomcat settings are still called sslWhatever.  Linked to the security-howto.html document.\n\nsecurity-howto.html: Added that the ciphers attribute supports OpenSSL syntax, plus an example attribute-value that works well today.  Also added a paragraph on sslEnabledProtocols since this is the only way I know to make standalone Tomcat POODLE-proof.\n\nI may have made these changes to the Tomcat 9 docs by accident, but they apply equally well to 8 or 9 AFAIK, so maybe someone could merge them appropriately?\n\nChristopher Schultz suggested on the Tomcat Users list 2011-11-13 that I try submitting a documentation patch here as an attachment.

The level of detail you have added to security-howto.xml is probably not necessary. The note about supporting OpenSSL-ciphers-style configuration should be in the configuration section instead.
