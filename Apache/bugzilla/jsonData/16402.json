[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I'm running Apache2 (2.0.43) and wanted to transparently send requests for\nPHP-processed files to an Apache1.3 instance, which runs PHP Accelerator\n(www.php-accelerator.co.uk). Naturally, I turned to mod_proxy and mod_rewrite.\nHowever, I (think I've) found a problem with either the docs or with mod_rewrite\nitself. Here's the ruleset I tried:\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} \\.php$\nRewriteRule ^/+(.*)$ http://otherhost.horde.net/$1 [P,NE,L]\n\nTurning on a RewriteLog showed that %{REQUEST_FILENAME} contained the URI of the\nrequest, not the full local path as stated in the mod_rewrite docs\n(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html). However, I found that\nthis ruleset works:\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{LA-U:REQUEST_FILENAME} \\.php$\nRewriteRule ^/+(.*)$ http://otherhost.horde.net/$1 [P,NE,L]\n\nIn order to get the full local path in %{REQUEST_FILENAME}, you have to force\nmod_rewrite to do a look-ahead with %{LA-U:REQUEST_FILENAME}.\n\nThe kicker is that the docs go on at length about the difference between\nREQUEST_URI and REQUEST_FILENAME. I found these variables to be identical unless\nyou force mod_rewrite to look ahead for REQUEST_FILENAME. I posted to\napache-users, but didn't get any response after a few days and this doesn't seem\nto be reported already.
