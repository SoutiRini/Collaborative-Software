Here's the scenario where getting the SSL info\non a post is absolutely critical:\n\nSay I want to make a web service application which clients can call to check on\ntheir order status (e.g., processing, shipped, etc.). I have a MySQL database\nwhich stores all the customer data (IDs, SSL public keys, etc.). Clients call an\nXML-RPC method to determine their order status. I want to be able to look up\ntheir customer ID based on the SSL cert they're using so I can issue the\nappropriate response. Pretty simple, right?\n\nXML-RPC (and SOAP) are both POST-based. That means if the client calls the\nXML-RPC method, I have no way of getting at the SSL cert that the client is\nusing, and therefore, cannot validate it with the one I have in the database.\n\nThis kind of authentication isn't necessarily all that commonplace in a\nuser-driven application, but is quite necessary for use in the world of web\nservices.\n\nIs there a workaround in the mean time?
