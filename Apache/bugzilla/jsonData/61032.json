[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61032, "text": "The problem seems not to be specific for a tomcat version. However, the version used on production which showed the problem is 8.5.9 (org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-jdbc:8.5.9). Used together with Java 8, but Java 7 should have similar results.\n\nThe tomcat documentation indicates a minimum pool of idle connections should be available. It scared me when I first saw this dropped below the minimum size.\nFrom the documentation at https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html (or https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html, the version I used);\nminIdle - (int) The minimum number of established connections that should be kept in the pool at all times. The connection pool can shrink below this number if validation queries fail. Default value is derived from initialSize:10 (also see testWhileIdle)\n\nI created a PR for this problem at https://github.com/apache/tomcat/pull/54.", "id": 198501, "time": "2017-04-24T18:23:51Z", "creator": "jelmer.terwal@nedap.com", "creation_time": "2017-04-24T18:23:51Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
