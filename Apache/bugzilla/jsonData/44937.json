It also adds support for the FSPA plex to determine what shapes correspond to characters in the document, although no code has been made to do so. The patch also extends PicturesTable.getAllPictures() to extract images from Escher drawings. Note that only pictures from the main body of the document (not headers, etc.) are extracted from Escher drawings with this patch.\n\nThere is also a minor fix to EscherClientAnchorRecord. The word format of this record is different from excel, etc., but I haven't found the exact format. This patch fixes the record from throwing an exception when read.\n\nThe patch includes a small test case.", "id": 116272, "time": "2008-05-05T16:23:37Z", "creator": "squeeself@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-05-05T16:23:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44937, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Could you please upload GaiaTest.doc and GaiaTestImg.png?\n\n(svn patches do not include binary files)\n\n\nThe rest of the patch has been applied to svn trunk, thanks for that", "id": 116853, "time": "2008-05-20T09:02:33Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2008-05-20T09:02:33Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44937, "attachment_id": null, "text": "There were some compiler errors in FSPATable.
