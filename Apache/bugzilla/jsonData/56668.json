When I deploy, the webapp works perfectly. When I restart Tomcat, I get 404s on the app's path (/foo). If I reload the app at the base context (path=/foo), the symptom remains. If I reload the app at the versioned context (path=/foo&version=00023), it begins working again. I'm going to go ahead and assume that it should not behave this way, since I would love my webapp to continue working after I restart the server.\n\nI've worked around the issue by always calling /manager/text/reload?path=/foo&version=00023 -- where 00023 is the latest version -- whenever the server starts."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56668, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/bugreport.html#Bugzilla_is_not_a_support_forum\n\nYou should diagnose your issue first, e.g. asking for help on the Tomcat users list, or TomEE users list.\n\nYou have not provided enough information to reproduce the issue.
