As per my request format everything is working fine. But there is an issue in HTTP Request Headers. I have added common http headers through the request. But Content-Type is added additionally through the request header. \n\nThe actual problem arises when reading the boundary value. JMeter additionally share charset in the content-type which is not actually needed for request headers.\n\nThis was faced in version 3.1. But in Jmeter 2.9 there is no charset shared in the request headers and it is processing successfully. \n\nPlease let me know how to disable the charset in content type for HTTP request headers.\n\nAttaching the screenshot of Request headers for v3.1 and v2.9."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60800, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 34792\nJmeter - v3.1\n\nJmeter - v3.1", "id": 197375, "time": "2017-03-02T08:48:54Z", "creator": "dr.hemachandar@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-03-02T08:48:54Z", "attachment_id": 34792}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 197376, "time": "2017-03-02T08:59:23Z", "bug_id": 60800, "creation_time": "2017-03-02T08:59:23Z", "text": "Hello,\nCan you show how your HttpRequest is configured ?\nPossibly attaching a short JMX plan instead of screenshot ?\nThanks"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "dr.hemachandar@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 34793, "is_private": false, "id": 197377, "time": "2017-03-02T09:09:12Z", "bug_id": 60800, "creation_time": "2017-03-02T09:09:12Z", "text": "Created attachment 34793\nhttp request"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 61384 ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 200471, "creation_time": "2017-08-27T12:29:39Z", "time": "2017-08-27T12:29:39Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "bug_id": 60800, "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 200474, "time": "2017-08-27T12:43:02Z", "bug_id": 60800, "creation_time": "2017-08-27T12:43:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Hello @Hemachandar, \nCan you test nightly build tomorrow and report wether this bug is fixed for you ?\n\n- http://jmeter.apache.org/nightly.html\n\nThanks"}]
