[{"text": "I have tried to compile mod_ssl, as it comes with 2.0.39 on windows with MSVC 6.\n\nI have found the following problems:\n1. Libraries paths are not correctly set in mod_ssl.mak. Solution:\n\nin LINK32_OBJS change lib paths to\n\n        \"..\\..\\srclib\\openssl\\out32dll\\ssleay32.lib\" \\\n        \"..\\..\\srclib\\openssl\\out32dll\\libeay32.lib\" \\\n\n(This occurs two times in the make file, one for release one for debug)\n\n- Tools like awk and bison are normaly not available on windows and they aren't \nnecessary, because the results are already part of distribution. Solution:\n\nDelete all sections that refer to awk or bison from mod_ssl.mak and abs.mak\n\nAfter this changes mod_ssl build and works on windows.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 10465, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 18993, "time": "2002-07-04T07:38:33Z", "creator": "richter@ecos.de", "creation_time": "2002-07-04T07:38:33Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "text": "\n  I'm certain it does.
