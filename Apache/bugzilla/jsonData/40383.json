GWT\nencapsulates ajax http calls, sending ajax requests via POST to server.\n\nServer always expects content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8. That is problem\nbecause JMeter's http sampler changes headers. Even if I have correct setting\nfor Content-type in the http request sampler node, JMeter changes this and sends\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded instead. As I said this is\nproblem with GWT ajax calls. Is there any way how to make JMeter not to change\nthis header? I used HTTP Request Manager Config element but with no success.\n\nAs a workaround I manually changed the source code, edited\norg.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.PostWriter and commented line, which\nchanges the header. However, there should be a cleaner way to do it.\n\nVladimir"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "OK - I've changed the code to only set the content-type if not already set.\n\nThe HttpClient sampler already behaves like this.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 40383, "id": 99218, "time": "2007-02-10T04:43:10Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-02-10T04:43:10Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 40233 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "is_private": false, "id": 99302, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "time": "2007-02-12T16:19:33Z", "bug_id": 40383, "creation_time": "2007-02-12T16:19:33Z", "attachment_id": null}]
