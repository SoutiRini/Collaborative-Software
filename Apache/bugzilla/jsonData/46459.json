Less ideal, but still better than the current state, would be if DB_UNKNOWN were used for non-create opens so that files in other formats would at least work. Barring either of the above, at the very least db2s() should be improved to report all the BDB errors that correspond to system errors as system errors and not user errors, so that sensible string messages come out (e.g. \"Invalid argument\" rather than \"(120022)APR does not understand this error code\").", "id": 123672, "time": "2008-12-31T20:25:56Z", "creator": "chead@chead.ca", "creation_time": "2008-12-31T20:25:56Z", "is_private": false}]
