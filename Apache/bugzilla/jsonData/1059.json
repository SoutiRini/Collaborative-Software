Classes from apps \nclassloader is available to the compiled JSPs when accessed via introspection \nAPI.\n\nTo reproduce, place any jar file (say, mail.jar from JavaMail). Access any \nclass from it using page import. E.g.,\n\n<%@ page import=\"javax.mail.Address\"%>\n\nThis results in an error message.\n\nReplace this with:\n\n<%=Class.forName(\"javax.mail.Address\"%>\n\nand it works as expected.\n\nWhich shows Jasper is using the wrong classpath to compile the JSPs.\n\nWorkaround is to use the common classloader, but we hear talks of more \nclassloaders (for groups of webapps), and please keep Jasper in sync with these \nexcellent changes."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This won't be addressed in Tomcat 3.2.2.
