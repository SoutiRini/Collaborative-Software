The server could not find the the \u201cconf.xml\u201d file because the \npath was incorrect for NT, the path was using UNIX file separators \"\\\". So, I \ndown loaded tomcat java files and took a look at the code. I could not believe \nthat there where hardcoded file separators like \\conf.xml instead of \nFile.separator + \"conf.xml\".  This happens many times over in the tomcat code.  \nThis makes running tomcat from VADD impossible on NT.\n\nPlease fix this ASAP.  This is a major problem for us\n\nThanks,\nMarc Chamberlain"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 503, "text": "same problem as bug 412", "id": 563, "time": "2001-02-05T07:47:01Z", "creator": "marc.chamberlain@systor.com", "creation_time": "2001-02-05T07:47:01Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 503, "text": "Won't be addressed in 3.2.2 but will be evaluated for a later release.", "id": 1470, "time": "2001-03-20T14:19:42Z", "creator": "marc.saegesser@apropos.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-20T14:19:42Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "cmanolache@yahoo.com", "text": "This should be resolved now, 3.3 seems fine.
