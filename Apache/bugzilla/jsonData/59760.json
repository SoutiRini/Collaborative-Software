This situation is less than ideal because work is duplicated and there is a lot inconsistency. It makes more sense to develop the service definition upstream and include it as part of the httpd release so each distro has a solid, consistent, supported starting point, and distros can collaborate via Apache to improve the service over time.\n\nI've attached a systemd service definition that I think would work well. I've adapted it from what Fedora 24 distributes ( http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/httpd.git/tree/httpd.service?h=f24 ), except I've added some additional hardening and changed the type from \"notify\" to \"forking\" because I'm hoping this service will be distributed with the next 2.4.x release which likely will not include mod_systemd.", "id": 191970, "time": "2016-06-27T14:39:51Z", "creator": "candrews@integralblue.com", "creation_time": "2016-06-27T14:39:51Z", "is_private": false}]
