This variable is in a\nrequest attribute. The custom tag library defines a scripting variable with a\nTag Extra Info class. The TLD declares a tag with the tag class implementation\nand the Tag Extra Info class implementation.\nThe tag is named \"variable\".\nThe tag has 3 attributes \"id\", \"className\", \"scopeIn\".\n\nThe object \"Song\" has a property \"title\".\n\nHere is where it fails : \n<%@ taglib uri=\"http://www.scort.com/test\" prefix=\"test\" %> \n...\n<!-- The variable is set in the scope request -->\n<test:variable id=\"mysong\" className=\"tomcat.test.Song\" scopeIn=\"request\" />\n...\nTitle : <jsp:getProperty name=\"mysong\" property=\"title\" />\n\n=> mysong is said to be null\n\nBut here is a page where it works : \n<%@ taglib uri=\"http://www.scort.com/test\" prefix=\"test\" %> \n...\n<!-- The variable is set in the scope page -->\n<test:variable id=\"mysong\" className=\"tomcat.test.Song\" scopeIn=\"page\" />\n...\nTitle : <jsp:getProperty name=\"mysong\" property=\"title\" />\n\nFinally it always works with jsp:useBean :\n\n<jsp:useBean id=\"mysong\" class=\"tomcat.test.Song\" scope=\"request\" />\n...\nTitle : <jsp:getProperty name=\"mysong\" property=\"title\" />\n\n\nThe custom library i wrote defined a VariableInfo that expose a scripting\nvariable into the page.

If this variable name is not found, a JasperException is thrown. However, what I believe is missing is a check of the parent hierarchy to see if it was declared at a higher level.
