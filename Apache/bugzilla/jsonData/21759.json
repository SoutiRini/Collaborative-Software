The failonerror attribute of the copy task\ndoes not work when copying a fileset which I believe does not make much sense.\n\nThe documentation states that there is no meaning in the failonerror in case of\nusing a fileset. Why not? If the fileset definition has problems, it makes sense\nto honor the failonerror value and to continue without performing the copy\noperation. At least in my case it does:\n\nI have to add some pictures for my javadocs from another subproject in my\nversion control system (MKS). If the subproject is not included in my local\nmaterialization, I would like to continue without those pictures, because the\njavadocs are a. not essential and b. still usable.\n\nHowever, I cannot do this using ant. I set the failonerror property on the\njavadoc task. OK! I set the failonerror property on the copy task. Not OK!\n\nIs there another solution?\n\nRegards,\n\nUli."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 41214, "time": "2003-07-23T13:11:39Z", "bug_id": 21759, "creation_time": "2003-07-23T13:11:39Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 18414 ***"}]
