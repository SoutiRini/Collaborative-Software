I always thought that setting the JIKESPATH env variable would force the \njavac task to hand off to jikes, thus letting you control which compiler you \nused on a per-user basis, rather than hard code it into a build file.\n\n2. but it doesn't, does it? All it does it set the java property \njikes.class.path which is then appended to the classpath passed in to jikes as \na parameter. \n\n3. So the only way to set the compiler for a user across all projects seems to \nbe to set ANT_OPTS=-Dbuild.compiler=jikes \n\nAm I correct in this statement? If so I will fix up the javac.html file to \nmention this fact.
