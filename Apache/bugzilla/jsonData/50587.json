This is a must in Apache projects.\n(2) repackaged CalculateMortgage.java and UserDefinedFunctionExample.java from poi.tests to org.apache.poi.ss.examples.formula\n(3) removed @Override from implemented interfaces, this is a JDK-1.6 feature. POI's language level is JDK-1.5 and it supports @Override only in sub-classes, not in interface implementatations. \n(4) Removed explicit instantiation of HSSFFormulaEvaluator. POI can work with UDFs in terms of common Spreadsheet interfaces:\n\n\n  UDFFinder udfToolpack = new DefaultUDFFinder( functionNames, functionImpls ) ;\n\n  // register the user-defined function in the workbook\n  workbook.addToolPack(udfToolpack);\n\n  FormulaEvaluator evaluator = workbook.getCreationHelper().createFormulaEvaluator();\n\nThe code above transparently works with HSSF and XSSF. \n\nOther than that, very cool! Thanks for the excellent patch.\n\nThe compiled documentation is available here:\n\nhttp://people.apache.org/~yegor/50587/site/spreadsheet/user-defined-functions.html\n\nIf there are no questions / objections, I will apply it later this week.\n\nRegards,\nYegor", "id": 143436, "time": "2011-01-18T10:18:40Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2011-01-18T10:18:40Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50587, "attachment_id": 26507, "text": "Created attachment 26507\nupdated patch", "id": 143437, "time": "2011-01-18T10:19:16Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2011-01-18T10:19:16Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "jsvede@yahoo.com", "text": "Created attachment 26508\nnew patch file with changes to documentation text and code samples\n\nThanks, Yegor!
