That causes Tomcat to run partially,\nas I can see from the logs that are generated, but than it again fails.\n\nRunning startup.sh under \"nohup\" helps.\n\nAppearently, startup.sh just triggers Tomcat to start,\nthen exists.  When the parent process of startup.sh happens to be teared down,\nthat causes a \"SIGHUP\" signal to be send to the Tomcat startup process.\n\nMy suggestion:\n\nEither make startup.sh a script that runs for as long as Tomcat runs,\nor truely daemonize right up front.\n\n(This is somewhat related to bug 11753.)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21993, "attachment_id": null, "id": 59355, "time": "2004-06-16T19:46:17Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-06-16T19:46:17Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The request is in fact a duplicate of 11753.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 11753 ***"}]
