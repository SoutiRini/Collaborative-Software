Take the example of a \nperson logged into multiple webapps in a portal (say Yahoo mail and chat).  \nWhen the user's mail session times out but the chat session is still active, \nthe user should not be kicked out of chat...  But when a user _actively_ signs \nout of mail, they should also be signed out of chat.", "count": 0, "id": 35370, "time": "2003-04-16T19:19:29Z", "bug_id": 19088, "creation_time": "2003-04-16T19:19:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19088, "text": "Marked as duplicate of 9077.  \n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 9077 ***", "count": 1, "id": 36240, "time": "2003-04-28T15:41:27Z", "creator": "patrick_conant@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-04-28T15:41:27Z", "is_private": false}]
