A \".Trashes\" folder on the root, a \".file\" and \nfinally the \"file\" itself. \n\nPlease add a 'hide-dot-files' option to the configuration file.  So the webdav \nservlet will filter those \".\" files and folders.\n\nOn a side note..it would be nice if a configurable list of prefixes and \nsuffixes where added to that filtering system.\n\nThanks,\nNeo", "id": 20620, "time": "2002-08-02T18:05:42Z", "creator": "neo@somd.net", "creation_time": "2002-08-02T18:05:42Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
