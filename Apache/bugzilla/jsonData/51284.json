Any case, with the vulnerable object in the session he can access to other object and may be even to send it remotely.\nI do recommend to change the implementation and to invalidate the existing HTTP session after the authentication.\nPlease find attached code with a fix.  I tested this code in my development environment.\nBest regards,\n  Michael \nSecurity Architect"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51284, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 51283 ***", "id": 146711, "time": "2011-05-28T15:14:09Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-05-28T15:14:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
