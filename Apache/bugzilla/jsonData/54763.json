Use a regular expression extractor in a blank test plan to set a variable X(Reference Name)\nex: X = me.jpg. In my scenario I am reading file paths from a txt file and extracting the file names using a regular expression extractor and setting them to a variable\n\n2. Add a sampler \"FTP Request\" and pass in the Variable X into the field \"Remote File:\"\nex: Remote File: ${X}\n\n3. Set the FTP Request to \"PUT\"\n\n4. Add Debug Sampler, Results Tree and run your test\n\nResult: Request for the FTP will look like:\nftp://localhost/${X} (Binary)  <- C:\\Users\\me\\Desktop\\me.jpg\n\ninstead of:\nftp://localhost/me.jpg (Binary)  <- C:\\Users\\me\\Desktop\\me.jpg"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "text": "Created attachment 30120\nTest Plan showing it works", "id": 166240, "time": "2013-03-29T22:04:59Z", "bug_id": 54763, "creation_time": "2013-03-29T22:04:59Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 30120}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 166241, "time": "2013-03-29T22:05:56Z", "bug_id": 54763, "creation_time": "2013-03-29T22:05:56Z", "is_private": false, "text": "As attached test plan shows it, it works for me.\nMaybe check extraction was fine using a debug sampler before ftp sampler.\n\nFeel free to open with more details"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54763, "text": "Thanks for the attachment, that helped a lot with determining what I was doing wrong..", "id": 166258, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "raghupatibandla@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-03-31T01:32:59Z", "time": "2013-03-31T01:32:59Z", "is_private": false}]
