[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3483, "text": "The usage information for Tomcat says that you can specify '-ajpid file' to \ntell where it to write the ajp12.id file. The start seems to ignore this option \nif supplied.\n\nWith 3.3b1 if you started Tomcat with '-Dtomcat.install=${TOMCAT_HOME} -\nDtomcat.home=/path/to/my/app' it would write the ajp12.id file \nto /path/to/my/app/conf/ajp12.id. With 3.3b2 unless you make tomcat.home point \nto where Tomcat's lib directory lives under, it won't find the .jar files. For \nthis reason it wants tomcat.home to be $TOMCAT_HOME, and so it writes ajp12.id \nto $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/ajp12.id. With this, if you want more than one instance of \nTomcat on the same system you need to create multiple copies of the Tomcat \ninstall.\n\nIn theory specifying a command line option like -ajpid at startup would fix \nthis, but unfortunately it is ignored.\n\nThis is related to #2682. Maybe I'm missing something - maybe there is still a \nway to get Tomcat to write the ajp12.id file relative to some directory other \nthan where Tomcat is installed.", "id": 5194, "time": "2001-09-06T22:46:42Z", "creator": "ben_kelley@ubsw.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-06T22:46:42Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "cmanolache@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 5257, "time": "2001-09-08T19:04:14Z", "bug_id": 3483, "creation_time": "2001-09-08T19:04:14Z", "is_private": false, "text": "You can do that by specifying <ContextManager home=\"/path/to/my/app\" /> \nin /path/to/my/app/conf/server.xml and starting tomcat with \ntomcat run -f /path/to/my/app/conf/server.xml.\n\nThen all the files ( logs, webapps, etc ) including ajpid would go to my/app.\n\nNote that TOMCAT_HOME and the system properties are very hard to keep around,\nit is far better to use options in server.xml.
