(In the example above, this would be \"/index.html\".)\n\nthis is very buggy explanation.\nby the way, there is not only documentation bug, but also mod_rewrite bug.\nbecause:\nURI means full uri from http: till #hash .\nREQUEST_URI mean, by rules of english language, uri which was requested from server, so it is usually without last #hash part and ends with query string or file name or directory name.\nbut in apache httpd mod_rewrite REQUEST_URI does not mean that, instead it means only part of uri without protocol, host, port, query string, question mark that is immediately before query string, also without #hash part. ie it is only part like /path/to/file or /path/to/file/ (which cannot contain unencoded question mark..) . so it should be warned in documentation or even mod_rewrite should use other keywords.\n\nexample configuraton part:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n\tServerName www2.example.com\n\tRewriteEngine on\n\t#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} http.*\n\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} www2\n\tRewriteRule .* http://sayt1.example.com/ [R=301]\n</VirtualHost>\nif REQUEST_URI meant request uri, it would redirect when http://www2.example.com/ is requested, but it does not, and it redirects if http://www2.example.com/www2 is requested. http://www2.example.com/?www2 also does not redirect.\n\none bad effect of this bug in mod_rewrite is that existence of question mark that is used to mark beginning of query string cannot be detected with mod rewrite in case of requested uri is like http://example.com/?  ."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49741, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 141224, "time": "2010-10-29T11:07:29Z", "creator": "rbowen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-29T11:07:29Z", "text": "Moving docs bugs to docs@httpd.a.o ownership."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "REQUEST_URI is already explained, what you want is for it to be \"justified\".
