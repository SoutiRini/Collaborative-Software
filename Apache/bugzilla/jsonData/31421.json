Everything was\nfine running log4j when I had only 1 application on my server - siblumber.com.\nLog4j was setup up like this - /WEB-INF/log4j.xml which uses\n${user.dir}/WEB-INF/logs/logname.txt in all its appenders.\n\nEverthing was fine up until I deployed a new application - royaleskincare.com.\nIt uses the EXACT same approach as siblumber.com, and here's what happens:\n\n1. Server is started up\n2. application royaleskicare.com is started up\n3. its event listener configures log4j using DOMConfigurator\n4. it writes a single line into royaleskincare.com/.../trace.txt\n(everything's fine so far)\n5. application siblumber.com is started up\n6. its event listener configures log4j using DOMConfigurator\n7. it writes a single line into siblumber.com/.../trace.txt\n\nAfter the server is finished starting up, I check all my loggers, and it turns\nout that BOTH royaleskincare.com AND siblumber.com loggers point to\n\"siblumber.com/.../logs/logname.txt\"\n\nIt seems that when the second application starts up, it re-configures log4j for\nthe first application. But how is it possible? Aren't web apps ran in separate\nJVMs? Even if I check System.getProperty(\"user.dir\"), they point to their\napproporiate directories.\n\nSo does log4j uses some kind of JVM-independent external configuration file that\ncauses it to mess up my first application?\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks in advance!", "id": 64220, "time": "2004-09-26T02:36:36Z", "creator": "ivj@comcast.net", "creation_time": "2004-09-26T02:36:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "text": "\nThe problem you are facing is a classloader issue independent of log4j.
