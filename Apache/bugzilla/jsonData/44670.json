This section starts at line 3440 in the configuration file (found by searching for \"configuring package in srclib/apr now\"). The erroneous command appears to be:\n\nif eval $SHELL $ac_abs_srcdir/configure $apr_configure_args --cache-file=$ac_sub_cache_file --srcdir=$ac_abs_srcdir $apache_apr_flags --prefix=$prefix --exec-prefix=$exec_prefix --libdir=$libdir --includedir=$includedir --bindir=$bindir --datadir=$datadir --with-installbuilddir=$installbuilddir\n\nUsing echos I have established that this is the problem command. However, quoting the two instances of $ac_abs_srcdir (or even all items that could possibly be paths) does not allow the configure file to proceed. I am no configure wizard, so this initial assessment may be rubbish.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nDon't use a path with a space. Ultimately, it may be that the entire configuration file relies upon this, making it impractical to fix this issue. In that case, it may be helpful to add a note to the INSTALL file."}]
