And later it crashes with the all too familiar \"ERROR: null\".\n\nThe fix appears to be very simple for someone familiar with the code, which\nwould not be me.  I would suggest accepting either property, with\na warning when the old one is used.\n\ncheers,\n-- Jamie Lokier"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "christian.geisert@isu-gmbh.de", "attachment_id": null, "id": 10540, "time": "2002-02-11T12:08:51Z", "bug_id": 4562, "creation_time": "2002-02-11T12:08:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Done in 0.20.3RC"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4562, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "count": 2, "id": 155870, "time": "2012-04-01T06:45:46Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:45:46Z", "is_private": false}]
