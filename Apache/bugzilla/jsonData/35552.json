I know what to put there for the JMS ConnectionFactory because the \nActiveMQ website has given an example for that. It will be a <Resource> \nelement.\n\nMy problem is - I want to find the Topic as well using the JNDI lookup. I do \nnot know the following.\n\n1. Is <Resource> element applicable for mapping with <message-destination-ref> \nin web.xml ?\n\n2. Do you have any sample <Context>.xml that shows JNDI lookup for ActiveMQ \ntopic and/or queue ?\n\nAppreciate any help in this matter.\n\nRegards\n\nAtanu"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "We don't support JMS, sorry.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 35552, "id": 76817, "time": "2005-06-29T22:49:01Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-06-29T22:49:01Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35552, "attachment_id": null, "id": 76821, "creation_time": "2005-06-30T00:42:48Z", "time": "2005-06-30T00:42:48Z", "creator": "atanu.mukherjee@jpmchase.com", "text": "I disagree with your view.\n\nI understand that Tomcat does not implement JMS.
