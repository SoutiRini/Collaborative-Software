My System is Opensuse 10.1 (32 bit) with Apache 2.2.3 and\nPHP 4.4.4 as apache module.\n\nIm having abrupt segmentation faults in my Apache errorlog. Most frequently the\nproblem seems to appear while accessing the start page of an actual Joomla\ninstallation, but i've had the error with an Worpress too. So it cannot be\nisolated to some php Scripts. Sadly i am not able to reproduce this error - when\nit appears it will not go until an apache restart, but then everything works\nfine for some time (maybe hours or even days).\n\nHere is a gdb backtrace of the request which died with a segmentation fault.\nHopefully someon can help me with this.
