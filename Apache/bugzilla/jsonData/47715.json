Enhance PrefixLines filter to support such a capability or add new PrefixLineNumbers filter.\n\nI would suggest that the user be required to provide the padding size for the line numbers or padding be ignored altogether (the benefit of padding is to have all line numbers consume the same number of characters at the beginning of the line).\n\n**Specific use case**\n\nOur build does RegEx-based validation of source files looking for forbidden code constructs.  The RegEx is used to identify all source files containing the forbidden code constructs, and for each identified source file, it generates an error and shows the offending lines.  Unfortunately, we're unable to display the line number for the offending lines.\n\n**Related enhancements**\n\n5748 seems related, but the thin details leave one wondering how the tokens were expected to be used."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47715, "attachment_id": 24154, "is_private": false, "id": 129822, "time": "2009-08-20T10:06:52Z", "creator": "david_hausladen@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2009-08-20T10:06:52Z", "text": "Created attachment 24154\nSample build file fragment showing possible use of new capability"}]
