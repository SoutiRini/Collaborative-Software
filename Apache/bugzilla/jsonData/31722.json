Unix Sockets\nwork the same way as ChannelSocket.\n\nHowever, for jni this calls ChannelJni.receive and it does\nnot call MsgAjp.processHeader() for bodyMsg. len is\nleft a 4 and if( bodyMsg.getLen() == 0 ) doesn't detect\nthe fact it should return at the point.\n\n> This is breaking jni POST by the way.\n\nI see why now (see above). I'm thinking MsgAjp.reset should\nset len = 0, but this needs a through review of all the uses of\nMsgAjp to see the impact. An alternative solution would be\nto add a method to MsgAjp that ChannelJni.receive could call\nthat sets len = 0.\n\n> Not sure if you are monitoring this email address so my message\n> above is very short.
