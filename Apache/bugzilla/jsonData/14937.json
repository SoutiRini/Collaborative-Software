If a servlet generates an HTML page it often will \nplace parameters and elements that are dependent on previous user choices.

However, because the button name and id are not known at the test \nwriting time it makes it impossible to write a test. \n\nPossible solutions are either a simple scripting language or a configuration \nelement that will iterate/filter HTML tags and will allow to store values in \ntest variables.
