It would be nice if either \n\n1) EJBJar used the build.compiler property just as Javac does.  This would \neffectively link the two tasks ensuring they use the same compiler.  I've had \nUnmarshallingExceptions galore when using EJBs where container classes are \ngenerated using Javac but the bean classes are compiled using Jikes.  This \noption is a little less flexible.\n\n2) Javac used an attribute to control the compiler, the same way that EJBJar \ndoes.  This way, they could be linked by a property if that's what you want, \nbut it's flexible enough to have them use seperate compilers if THAT's what you \nwant (for whatever reason).\n\nNot a high priority, since I'm sure there's a workaround right now.\nThanks,\nDavid"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1213, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 3802, "time": "2001-07-18T07:05:21Z", "creator": "conor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-07-18T07:05:21Z", "text": "Done by having the ejbjar task pick up build.compiler value.
