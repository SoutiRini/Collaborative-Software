I made a small modification to return \"null\" if nothing is specified.  I agree that the Word Application assumes TOP if alignment is not specified, but I'd like to keep the code closer to the xml.\n\nIf others disagree, we can change it back.\n\nThe mods you suggest do fix the NPE, and I've included your test and test docx.
