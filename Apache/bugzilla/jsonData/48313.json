The method available() isn't guaranteed to return the number bytes in the stream, rather it returns the number of bytes that can be read before blocking.\n\nTo correctly read the entire File contents, a looping read must be employed. I've modified the code to maintain the functionality, but perform a guaranteed full read of the File."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "svn revision 887838\n\nThanks!", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 48313, "id": 132633, "time": "2009-12-06T21:29:42Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-12-06T21:29:42Z", "is_private": false}]
