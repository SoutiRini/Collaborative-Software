I\nattached a one-line patch that fixes it.\n\nIn method \"AbstractReplicatedMap.excludeFromSet\", the loop over \"mbrs\"\nshould break immediately after \"include\" is set to \"false\".  All the\niterations after \"include\" is set to \"false\" do not perform any useful\nwork, at best they just set \"include\" again to \"false\".\n\nMethod \"inSet\" in the same class \"AbstractReplicatedMap\" (right above\nthe definition of \"excludeFromSet\") has a similar loop (over \"set\"),\nand this loop breaks immediately after \"result\" is set to \"true\", just\nlike in the proposed patch.  Other methods (e.g.,\n\"MapperListener.findDefaultHost\", \"CollectVisitor.checkSeen\",\n\"JspDocumentParser.processChars\", \"ParameterParser.isOneOf\") also have\nsimilar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed patch.", "id": 167874, "time": "2013-06-17T18:12:00Z", "creator": "nistor1@illinois.edu", "creation_time": "2013-06-17T18:12:00Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Thanks for the patch.
