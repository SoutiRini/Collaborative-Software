The following I have observed:\n\nRunning my test case with Tomcat as a console application provides a equivalent \nperformance for Tomcat 3.2.3, 3.3a and 4.0.1..\n\nRunning Tomcat as a service Tomcat 3.2.3 and 3.3a are 50% faster than Tomcat \n4.0. But for the versions 3.2.3 and 3.3a I have used jk_nt_service.exe to \ninstall the services.\n\nSo I have done another test. I have compared Tomcat 3.3a services installed \neither with JavaService.exe and jk_nt_service.exe. \n\nThe service installed with JavaService.exe runs 50% slower than the one \ninstalled with jk_nt_servive.exe.\n\nSo I reopend the bug to suggest a solution with jk_nt_service.exe because no\nuser will accept a performance decrease of 50%.\n\nBest regards\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "id": 9973, "time": "2002-01-28T09:30:20Z", "creator": "thomas2.maesing@bgs-ag.de", "creation_time": "2002-01-28T09:30:20Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6055, "attachment_id": null, "id": 9975, "time": "2002-01-28T11:13:26Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-01-28T11:13:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Running TC as a service or not makes no difference in performance, which is\nnormal (the same code is executed)."}]
