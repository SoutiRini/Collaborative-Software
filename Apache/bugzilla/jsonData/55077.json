The statement is exaggerating as well.  strtoul is defined in POSIX-2001, BSD's stdlib.h, and many more - with the exception of sunos4 for sure, but that's obsolete for a decade at least.\n\nThat said, I have no strong opinion on it. Feel free to keep it, if you feel like, but I doubt this outweighs breaking any semi-recent C standard.", "count": 0, "id": 167725, "time": "2013-06-07T17:05:12Z", "creator": "arno@debian.org", "creation_time": "2013-06-07T17:05:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55077, "text": "trunk commit: r1491155\nproposed for 2.4", "id": 167746, "time": "2013-06-09T08:23:01Z", "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "creation_time": "2013-06-09T08:23:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55077, "text": "in 2.4.6 release (r1494121)", "count": 2, "id": 168826, "time": "2013-07-26T17:56:25Z", "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-07-26T17:56:25Z", "is_private": false}]
