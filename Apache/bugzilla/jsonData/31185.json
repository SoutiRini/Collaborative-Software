Clicking OK alone seems to not save\nthe value to disk.\n\nSo there are two major problems here:\n\n1) Configuration values are being corrupted by the GUI (leads to hours of fun\ndebugging what the heck is going wrong)\n2) Clicking OK is not enough to save changes to disk. Apply is meant to be an\noptional button, not required.\n\nI consider this a major bug in the native packaging because it is very easy to\ncorrupt the configuration and then one spends hours trying to figure out what\nthe heck is going wrong with Tomcat.
