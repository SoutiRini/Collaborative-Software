[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The user_name column of my users table is case insensitive, so users do not need\nto remember the case of their name (Am I \"User\" or \"user\"?).\n\nThe downside: request.getRemoteUser() always reflects the spelling used to log\nin, not the spelling contained in the database. In order to get the correct\nspelling, I have to \"SELECT user_name FROM users WHERE user_name = ?\" each time\nI want to process the user name.\n\nMy suggestion is to also fetch the user name with the SELECT needed to get the\npassword when logging in. This shouldn't be of much impact, because the SELECT\nstatement is needed anyway, there is just one more column to transfer. JDBCRealm\nshould pass the name stored in the database when queried for the name to return\nwith request.getRemoteUser().\n\nRegards,\n\nAndreas", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 25148, "id": 48400, "time": "2003-12-02T20:28:57Z", "creator": "apache.org@schildbach.de", "creation_time": "2003-12-02T20:28:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 26494 ***", "id": 143768, "time": "2011-01-28T18:02:50Z", "bug_id": 25148, "creation_time": "2011-01-28T18:02:50Z", "is_private": false}]
