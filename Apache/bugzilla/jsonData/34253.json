We did exactly this for using client certs and it's very\neasy to do.  Of course, you'll need the source version of lenya to build it.\n\nEnclosed is some code that implements this.  Instructions to use it:\n\n1) in your current lenya, create the user \"anonymous\" with any password and give\nit admin, edit and review access (groups)\n2) cd to your lenya source root directory (this is the directory that has\nsrc/java below it)\n3a) mkdir -p src/java/edu/mit/idd/lenya\n3b) copy the attached java file to the above directory\n4) edit src/webapp/WEB-INF/cocoon-xconf.xsl:\n find the component block for the UserAuthenticator and comment it out\n add this component which does it's job instead:\n  <component logger=\"lenya.ac.authenticator\"\n      class=\"edu.mit.idd.lenya.AnonymousAuthenticator\"\n      role=\"org.apache.lenya.ac.Authenticator\"/>\n\n5) ./build.sh (or ./build.sh install if you're using tomcat)\n6) restart lenya\n\nYou also might want to set your session timeout to 0 in your tomcat config\nbecause if you leave your edit window open too long without saving it will go\nback to the authoring view when you go to save and you'll lose any edits.\n\nIf you need to go back to regular lenya authentication, just remove the changes\nyou made to cocoon-xconf.xsl and rebuild.\n\n-mm"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34253, "attachment_id": 14601, "is_private": false, "id": 73157, "time": "2005-03-31T18:01:23Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-31T18:01:23Z", "text": "Created attachment 14601\nAnonymousAuthenticator class"}, {"text": "this has been added (in slightly changed form), including some documentation.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 34253, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 74594, "time": "2005-05-08T22:58:37Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-05-08T22:58:37Z", "attachment_id": null}]
