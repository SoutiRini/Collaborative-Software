[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Sessions should timeout due to user inactivity. I take this to mean that any \nactivity within the specified timout interval should reset the timeout clock. \nThe current implementation requires the user to access the session TWICE within \nthe timout interval, instead of once, in order to prevent a timeout. To be \nclear, if the timeout period is set 30min, and a user logs in and then accesses \nthe session once after 25 minutes and a second time 10 minutes later, the \nsession will have incorrectly timed out before the second access.\n\nI believe the problem is located with processExpires()in StandardManager. It \nuses session.getLastAccessedTime() to calculate the timeout period. \ngetLastAccessedTime() returns the time to the previous request instead of the \ntime to the most recent request.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 20083, "id": 37501, "time": "2003-05-20T19:51:55Z", "creator": "kac@thinksrs.com", "creation_time": "2003-05-20T19:51:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20083, "attachment_id": 6472, "is_private": false, "id": 37702, "time": "2003-05-23T22:42:21Z", "creator": "kac@thinksrs.com", "creation_time": "2003-05-23T22:42:21Z", "text": "Created attachment 6472\nProposed patches to fix timeout bug."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20083, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 56143, "time": "2004-04-20T22:31:46Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-04-20T22:31:46Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 15463 ***"}]
