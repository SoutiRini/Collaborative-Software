Its something to do\nwith how webapp-level logging is configured and xml format\nincompatibilities. It is supposed to be fixed in later Log4j versions.\n\nThe supposed problem was due to log4j.dtd specifying that the name attribute of a logger element be \nan ID (overly strict), Tomcat using logger names with characters prohibited by the XML ID type, and \nlog4j reporting that as an error though the message does not adversely affect the configuration.\n\nThe \"fix\" is the change to change LogLog.error to LogLog.warn and to tweak the wording to indicate \nthat a validation failure (or other call to ErrorHander.error) is a \"Continuable parsing error...\" where a \nwell-formedness error is a \"Fatal parsing error...\".\n\nlog4j 1.2.12 candidate.", "id": 77868, "time": "2005-07-31T01:53:19Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-07-31T01:53:19Z", "attachment_id": null}]
