Naturally, the first time I though it should be somebody else that touch \nit but I learn than nobody touch it.  so I decide to do some real stress test \nand conclude than it really turn down the day after.\n\nThis solution was choosed for a eCommerce Solution, I cannot imagine running \nTomcat online if it turn down by itself.  Do you have any ideas how to resolve \nthat issue???  And we are running on time so if we have to change the \nsolution \"to run\" servlets and JSP, please tell me ASAP.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancois-Yanick Bourassa\nbourfran@'cognicase.ca"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "There isn't enough detail to determine the nature of the problem, so I'm\nresolving this bug as \"invalid\".
