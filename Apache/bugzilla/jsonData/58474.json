On Debian recent stable jessie release, by default tomcat8's CATALINA_HOME has no webapps directory, whereas CATALINA_BASE does, and moving the sample war file to CATALINA_BASE will deploy it.\n\nI have attached a patch where I change the documentation to read:\n\n\"The easiest way to run this application is simply to move the war file to your <b>CATALINA_HOME/webapps</b> directory (or if you are running multiple instances, move the war file to your <b>CATALINA_BASE/webapps</b> directory).\"\n\nOne reason for extra explanation here is this is one of the first things someone new to Tomcat will see, and that note will probably save them from some confusion."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58474, "text": "Thanks for the report.\n\nFixed in trunk and 8.0.x for 8.0.28 onwards.\n\nI used a slightly different form of words to provide a pointer to more information since I wanted to keep this page as simple as possible.", "id": 185635, "time": "2015-10-05T20:27:50Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-10-05T20:27:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
