But if the shape has no points (i.e. shape.getPathIterator(...).isDone() returns true) there will only the instructions W n written to the pdf page content stream.\nThe attached patch will fix this by checking if the PathIterator has at least one segment. If not, it will return without doing anything."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the patch, Francois.
