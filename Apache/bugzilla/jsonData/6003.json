It would be very simple to find the local interfaces as well!\n\nI assume that you have considered this, but since I couldn't find any trace in \nthe ant-dev mailing list, I am filing this report.\n\nIf you are interested, I have found that resolving this problem is easy - I \njust added two more constants to DescriptorHandler:\n\nprivate static final String LOCAL_INTERFACE\t = \"local\"; \nprivate static final String LOCAL_HOME_INTERFACE = \"local-home\";\n\nand extended the test for element type in processElement() of DescriptorHandler:\n\nif (currentElement.equals(HOME_INTERFACE)   ||\n    currentElement.equals(REMOTE_INTERFACE) ||\n    currentElement.equals(BEAN_CLASS)       ||\n    currentElement.equals(PK_CLASS)\t    ||\n    currentElement.equals(LOCAL_INTERFACE)  ||\n    currentElement.equals(LOCAL_HOME_INTERFACE))\n\nand it became possible to ejb compile EJBs with local interfaces using Ant.\n\nRegards\nBrynjar Glesnes", "id": 9839, "time": "2002-01-24T10:46:01Z", "bug_id": 6003, "creation_time": "2002-01-24T10:46:01Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6003, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 10222, "time": "2002-02-02T13:36:24Z", "creator": "conor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-02-02T13:36:24Z", "text": "This has been fixed in CVS a while ago - please try a recent nightly build."}]
