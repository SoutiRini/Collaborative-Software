[{"text": "Test plans using a \"JDBC Connection Configuration\" element will _not start_ \nwith remote testing!\n\nThe error message of the remote server is:\njava.lang.NullPointerException \n        at org.apache.jmeter.protocol.jdbc.config.DataSourceElement.testStarted\n(DataSourceElement.java:91) \n        at org.apache.jmeter.protocol.jdbc.config.DataSourceElement.testStarted\n(DataSourceElement.java:109) \n        at \norg.apache.jmeter.engine.StandardJMeterEngine.notifyTestListenersOfStart\n(StandardJMeterEngine.java:201) \n        at org.apache.jmeter.engine.StandardJMeterEngine.run(StandardJMeterEngin\ne.java:315) \n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) \n\nThis has nothing to do with wrong classpath or such. Having a look at the \nsource code of DataSourceElement it seems that the transient property \"started\" \nis causing the problem. [http://www.devx.com/tips/Tip/13726]\nTo verify that I removed the \"transient\" keyword in my environment, compiled, \nre-started - and my testplan started remotely (i.e. no NullPointerException).\n\nSince I have no idea about the internal logic of JMeter and there are even more \ntransient properties in the mentioned class, I suggest to have a look at the \nclass as a whole.
