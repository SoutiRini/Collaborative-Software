It doesn't seem to matter which listerner creates JTL, altough in our\ncase we use the Simple Data Writer \n\nWhat we noticed from analyzing the JTL files is that the Average, Min and Max\nseem to be doubled while the Rate is completely incorrect.\n\nWe tried to do the tests by recording directly on the Aggregate Report and not\nusing the Simple Data Writer. Leaving aside the fact that JMeter routinely\ncrashes in such tests (out of memory), the values displayed by the screen by\nAggregate Report seem closer to reality.\n\nThis seems related to bug 29481\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29481\nSaved Aggregate Report is Different from original when reloaded\n\nbut since the Average, Min, Max and Rate are fundamental in assesing the\nperformance, we think this should be a P1\n\nWe use JMeter by 3 years at Idiom Technologies and there is any way we can\ncontribute, including to solve this bug, please let us know.", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36305, "text": "By the way, 2.0.2 is quite old now.
