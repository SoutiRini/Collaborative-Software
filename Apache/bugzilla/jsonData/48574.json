For example if I have three paragraphs between two tables I am only able to insert a table between these two tables. But I cannot position the table excatly after the first of the three paragraphs. Initially I tried to handle this problem with XmlCursors, but debugging an XmlCursor is not a very funny. \uf04c So I decided to create a marker Interface IBodyElement, which is implemented by XWPFParagraph and XWPFTable (Yes I call them BodyElements). On the other Hand I created the Interface IBody which is implemented by all Classes, who owns arrays with tables and paragraphs. (Actually this are the classes XWPFDocument, XWPFTableCell, XWPFHeaderFooter). In IBody there a some signature of methods which are handling the operations with XWPFTable and XWPFParagraph in a Body.\nTo support styles and numberings  the classes XWPFStyles, XWPFStyle, XWPFNumbering, XWPFNum, XWPFAbstractNum are added. The classes XWPFPictureData and XWPFPicture were created to support pictures. This classes are quit equal to XSSFPictureData and XSSFPicture. \uf04a\n\nHope you like my changes. :-)\nPhilipp Epp", "id": 133702, "time": "2010-01-19T08:16:46Z", "creator": "Philipp.Epp@hoefliger.de", "creation_time": "2010-01-19T08:16:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 24861}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48574, "attachment_id": 24862, "is_private": false, "id": 133703, "time": "2010-01-19T08:18:53Z", "creator": "Philipp.Epp@hoefliger.de", "creation_time": "2010-01-19T08:18:53Z", "text": "Created attachment 24862\nTest-Data of the test cases in the previous patch\n\nthis test-data must be added to Test-Data/documents/"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48574, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hello all\n\nMaybe someone can look into this.

That should allow you to get feedback, and give us a heads-up on the impending patch. This generally reduces the chances that everyone sees a monster patch and decides \"I don't have time to review that now, I'll wait for someone else\"...\n\nAlso, any chance you could send in an ICLA at some point when you have a minute? <http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt>.
