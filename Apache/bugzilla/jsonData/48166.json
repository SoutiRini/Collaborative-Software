[{"count": 0, "text": "connectionTimeout property of sever.xml doesnt work as expected:- connection dosent close even after the time limit(20000 milli-secomnds) expired. to test this i deployed a servlet, in tomcat sever, servlet has Thread.sleep(70000) in code. i am expecting \"connection closed error\" but still after 70000 milli-seconds i got response back. Ideally tomcat should close the connection after 20000 miliseconds if response doesnt come.\n\nplease not servlet is deployed in stand alone tomcat sever\n\nthanks,\n-vichitra", "bug_id": 48166, "attachment_id": null, "id": 131841, "time": "2009-11-10T05:16:41Z", "creator": "vichi100@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-11-10T05:16:41Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "That isn't what the timeout is intended for.
