The easiest way to fix this \nis: \n1) Take out the jaxp.jar and parser.jar files from the $TOMCAT_HOME/lib \ndirectory. \n\n2) Go to http://java.sun.com/xml and download the JAXP v1.1 zip. \n\n3) Copy the jaxp.jar and crimson.jar files into $TOMCAT_HOME/lib. \n\nRestart Tomcat and you'll be set. :o) You can now use the JAXP 1.1 API in your \napps and Tomcat won't complain one bit. I would imagine you can do this with \nother JAXP parsers too.\n\nBut I can't find jaxp.jar and crimson.jar from sun web site. I am looking \nforward to apache's fix and deliver a cleaner tomcat version. Where do I \ndownload from apache site?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Use a modern JDK please.
