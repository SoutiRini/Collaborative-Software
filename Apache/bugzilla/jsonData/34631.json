I have scaled down the problem to \nusing only JSVGCanvas and the AWT/SWT bridge in it's simplest form.  As svg \ndiagrams are loaded with the JSVGCanvas new memory is allocated on the heap.  \nThis memory is seldom returned and cleaned up.  After between 5 and 20 minutes \nof reloading svg graphics Eclipse gives a heap out of memory error.  I have \ntried increasing the heap size and it still crashes eventually.  Please contact \nme for the plugin code.  I am using Redhat Enterprise 3 update 3 Linux.
