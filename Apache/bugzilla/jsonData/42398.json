Additional synchronization might\nfix this, but it's easy and effective to discard the redundant exception.\n\n\n(I ran into this while tracking real IllegalStateException cases caused by our\ncode.  It took a little research to determine that this IllegalStateException is\nNOT a problem.  So it might save other developers some confusion and effort if\nadditional comments were present.)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "(Restoring bug summary.)\n\n@khushboo: please don't change bug fields unless you know what you're doing.
