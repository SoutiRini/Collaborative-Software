[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 60026, "text": "Pages from httpd documentation end with a Comments section where readers are invited to post comments. This section starts with a notice which reads:\n\nThis is not a Q&A section. Comments placed here should be pointed towards suggestions on improving the documentation or server, and may be removed again by our moderators if they are either implemented or considered invalid/off-topic. Questions on how to manage the Apache HTTP Server should be directed at either our IRC channel, #httpd, on Freenode, or sent to our mailing lists.\n\nSo that commenters do not miss this notice, it is bordered in red. This has the unfortunate side effect of making that paragraph the most prominent one (disregarding its positions) of many pages, even though it is the least relevant, since it must be only a small minority of readers who consider commenting.\n\nThis can be solved be simply initially hiding the notice, until \"Post a comment\" is clicked, which should be trivial since there is already JavaScript to reveal the comment form.\n\nBy the way:\nI wonder why the notice contains \"removed again\". Would \"removed\" not suffice?\nThe texts \"No comments have been made so far.\" and \"The 2.4 branch of the documentation has comments available for this page. Click here to view them.\" do not have to be in different paragraphs.
