Running the /bin/startup script \neverything works fine, i.e. jsp's got compiled correct.\n\nAt my web-search i found people who have the same problem, but i couldn't \nfound the bug in the database. Someone tell to use the windows-installer-exe \n(jakarta-tomcat-5.0.27.exe) and define the JAVA_HOME to use. I've done this \nand the guy was right. \n\nThe service that was installed within the installation process of jakarta-\ntomcat-5.0.27.exe works fine. This service compiles jsp's as well, but the \nservice.bat did not!\n\nIt would be great to hear soon from you:)\n\nThanks in advance, Leif", "id": 61178, "time": "2004-07-27T12:45:18Z", "creator": "leif.hanack@t-systems.com", "creation_time": "2004-07-27T12:45:18Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 61244, "creation_time": "2004-07-28T15:19:14Z", "time": "2004-07-28T15:19:14Z", "bug_id": 30346, "text": "If you want to hear from us, the mailing lists are a better place than \nBugzilla.
