[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nI keep getting this error. I have compiled my apache 2.4.3 from source on RedHat 6.3 Enterprise Servers.\n\nI have configured my Virtual Host to port 80, 443.\n\nI am trying to run a non-SSL (HTTP) port on 443, and then present the certificate through Tomcat 7 Server. The certificate is installed over on tomcat 7 Server.\n\nthis set up is working in one of the environments but not in the other two. I have gone through all the configurations and made sure, they are exactly the same. Still i keep getting this error.\n\nEnv A - Working\nEnv B - Not Working\nEnv C - Not working.\n\nWhen i compiled from the source code, i did not realize that the openssl-devel package was missing in ENV A, and that MOD_SSL compilation has failed, but when i set up the port 443, for this environment it was working.\n\nI made sure, i replicate it for other environments as well... but without any success.\n\nCan somebody please point me in the right direction ? Could it be a firewall related issue?\n\nMany Thanks in advance.", "is_private": false, "id": 166479, "creator": "siddhubp@gmail.com", "time": "2013-04-08T19:46:24Z", "bug_id": 54816, "creation_time": "2013-04-08T19:46:24Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54816, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 166480, "time": "2013-04-08T21:28:09Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-08T21:28:09Z", "text": "No logs, configuration, or details about the request -- what's the bug?"}]
