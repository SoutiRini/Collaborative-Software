I can understand why that would be problematic (output to client before input from client is complete).\n\nI see the same behavior as 39342 when writing a bunch of data to STDERR before fully reading STDIN.  I assume it's the same root issue as 39342: Apache simply doesn't do anything with the CGI script's other file handles (STDOUT *or* STDERR) while it's sending the script the data.\n\nThis prevents the CGI script from potentially logging data while it's reading data from Apache.  That functionality shouldn't be prevented.  I can produce a test case if necessary, as I'm hitting the bug today."}]
