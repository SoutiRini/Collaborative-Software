[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54313, "text": "Method 'store' in class ::Database returns what returned by methods 'insert' (for a new row) or 'update' (for an existing row). Previously 'store' returned invariably 1 on normal execution of the method, making it a unusuable value for having insight in what the method did internally (this behaviour is undocumented in the manual). Package Session's 'store' method turned out to test this value to detect error conditions thus it fails when a call to 'store' doesn't change any value in an existing row. To prevent other incompatibilities the old behaviour will be reinstated in the code in 'trunk'.", "id": 164114, "time": "2012-12-17T00:06:06Z", "creator": "mxmanghi@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-12-17T00:06:06Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54313, "text": "fixed in trunk", "id": 164928, "time": "2013-01-29T15:07:47Z", "creator": "mxmanghi@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-01-29T15:07:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
