[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43467, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi,\n\ni am currently writing some Samplers for JMeter and realized that the source\ncode in HTTPSampler may throw a NullpointerException in one special case,\nbecause there is a logical programming error:\n\nLook at the method sample(URL, String, boolean, int) in HTTPSampler:\nOn (my) line 404 you can find the following statement:\ncon = setupConnection(url, method, res);\n\nThe method used (setupConnection) may throw an IOException. This statement is\nthe first one in the surrounding try block to initialize the HttpURLConnection \nconn (which is initially set to null). If the setupConnection(...) method now\nthrows the IOException on the first execution, the conn object would still have\nthe null state. Now go to the catch block handling the IOException. There you\ncan see the following code:\n\nres.sampleEnd();\nconn.disconnect(); <= this is where a NullpointerException may be thrown\n\nNaturally its a programming error of mine that the IOException is thrown here,\nbut it is not very useful if the debugging message is supressed, because the\nNullpointerException is thrown here and no output is generated from the\nIOException ... That is why I set it to trivial.\n\nWould be nice if anyone of you guys could handle it.", "id": 108544, "time": "2007-09-24T14:37:08Z", "creator": "ronny.karallus@web.de", "creation_time": "2007-09-24T14:37:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 108545, "time": "2007-09-24T14:55:40Z", "bug_id": 43467, "creation_time": "2007-09-24T14:55:40Z", "tags": [], "text": "Thanks, but this was fixed in 2.3RC3\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 42057 ***"}]
