[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14714, "text": "The problem arises when you want to use a URL that has been encoded by\nHttpServletResponse.encodeURL() with either a \"Refresh\" header or a \"Refresh\"\nmeta tag. Netscape/Mozilla seem to work, but IE 4.x, 5.x, 6.x looses the\nsession if cookies are turned off. To make an example:\n\nI need to reload a certain page (or a different page) after some period \nof time. I use a meta-tag\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"30;\nURL=http://my.server.com/my/servlet;jsessionid=WHATEVER?id=1234\">\n\nThe problem is the \";\" in the URL. IE seems to stop parsing and does\nnot submit the session id. While I have seen that this is some kind of\ngeneral problem servlet containers have, the usual workaround, submitting\nthe session id as ordinary request parameter, does no longer work with\nTomcat. I think that it worked with previous versions. \n\nEven quoting the URL does not solve the problem. Other people may experience\nsimilar problems if they want to use such an URL in JavaScript. No, \nencodeRedirectURL() does not work, either. \n\nPS: For me, the severity would be at least \"major\", I just didn't want to \nescalate the thing too much.", "id": 26662, "time": "2002-11-20T17:05:01Z", "creator": "ap@apeiron.de", "creation_time": "2002-11-20T17:05:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14714, "is_private": false, "text": "The use of a semi-colon with jsesisonid is as per the spec.\n\nThe fact that this works with Mozilla and Netscape is a pretty clear \nindication that this is an IE problem, not a tomcat one.
