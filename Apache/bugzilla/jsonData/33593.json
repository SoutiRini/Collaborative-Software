[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "A zero-percent colwidth causes FOP to run forever when attempting to generate PDF. Yes, I agree that \n<colspec colwidth=\"0*\"/> does not make much sense, but it's unfriendly for FOP to never terminate as \na result of this. (I discovered this problem as a result of debugging output from a table-generator that \nhad a bug.)\n\nSample file to demonstrate the problem:\n\n<!DOCTYPE section PUBLIC\n          \"-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.3//EN\"\n          \"http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.3/docbookx.dtd\">\n<section>\n\n <title>\n  XXX\n </title>\n\n <informaltable>\n   <tgroup cols=\"2\">\n     <colspec colwidth=\"50*\"/>\n     <colspec colwidth=\"30*\"/>\n     <tbody>\n       <row>\n         <entry>\n          XXX\n         </entry>\n         <entry>\n          XXX\n         </entry>\n       </row>\n     </tbody>\n   </tgroup>\n </informaltable>\n\n</section>\n\nAs shown, the file processes through FOP okay. However, if you change \"50*\" to \"0*\" in the first \n<colspec> line, FOP doesn't terminate. (Strictly speaking, I don't know if it runs *forever*, but it \ncertainly runs a very long time.)", "attachment_id": null, "id": 71030, "creator": "paul@kitebird.com", "time": "2005-02-15T19:23:33Z", "bug_id": 33593, "creation_time": "2005-02-15T19:23:33Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "j3322ptm@yahoo.de", "is_private": false, "text": "An interesting variant of the \"not even the first char will fit on the\nline\" bug.
