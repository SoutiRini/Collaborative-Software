If however, the array is broken on an odd element the odd item is split where it's ID is kept in the first array and its value is placed on the second leading to a \"Bad Parameter\" error when checking compatibility. There is no maximum size of the nums array given in the PDF specification, so why Acrobat is doing this is unknown (performance benefits maybe). To ensure that anyone editing a FOP PDF in Acrobat Pro does not come across this problem, this patch addresses it by splitting the nums array if it exceeds a value (50)."}, {"attachment_id": 29610, "tags": [], "creator": "rmeyer@hotmail.co.uk", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 163535, "time": "2012-11-19T16:53:53Z", "bug_id": 54169, "creation_time": "2012-11-19T16:53:53Z", "text": "Created attachment 29610\nForgot the test case"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 163538, "time": "2012-11-19T18:55:21Z", "bug_id": 54169, "creation_time": "2012-11-19T18:55:21Z", "text": "Patch applied in rev. 1411352:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1411352&view=rev\n\nI removed the re-definition of the getNums method in PDFPageLabels that had become identical to the original one (in PDFNumberTreeNode). This avoids a FindBugs warning.\n\nThanks for your patch!\nVincent"}]
