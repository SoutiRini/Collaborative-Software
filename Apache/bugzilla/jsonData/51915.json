But in pdf document and in web-page some words are placed in different lines. I understand, that TLF and FOP use different line breaking algorithm, but maybe FOP has possibility to use more simple algorithm not to \"align\" the text? I offer a simple code change to make FOP ignoring too loose or too tight lines.
