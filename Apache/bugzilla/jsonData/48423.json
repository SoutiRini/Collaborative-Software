The \"solution\" appears to be to configure IIS to only apply the ISAPI filter to a specific virtual folder instead of the entire server.  \n\nHowever, on XP (and possibly any non-server OS), that is not possible.  You can only configure an ISAPI filter for the one and only Default Web Site.    When this happens, the ISAPI filter seems to first process your page on your configured worker as expected, but then it redirects requests for \"/jakarta/isapi_redirect.dll\" through \"ajp13\" regardless of your worker configuration.   So, it appears impossible to make JK work on a non-server OS.   I've tested this with versions as old as 1.2.10.\n\nThe long deprecated JK2 does, however, work perfectly fine.  It appears the isapi filter in 1.x needs to do a better job of passing /jakarta/* through."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48423, "text": "We use the IIS Tomcat Connector on Windows XP every day without issue.\nThe Tomcat Users list (and the documentation on the Tomcat website) would be the place to look for help resolving your issue.", "id": 133294, "time": "2010-01-03T23:55:04Z", "creator": "Tim.Whittington@orionhealth.com", "creation_time": "2010-01-03T23:55:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
