Setup starts with:\n\n\"This setup will perform an upgrade of 'Apache HTTP Server 1.3.33'. Do you want\nto continue?\"\n\nClick 'OK'\n\nActual Results:\n\nInstallation Wizard continues but halts during the 'Registering Product'\noperation and produces the following error:\n\n\"Error 1316.A network error occurred while attempting to read from the file\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\_is5F82\\Apache HTTP Server 1.3.33.msi\"\n\nInstallation then terminates prematurely after a click of the OK button.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe installation wizard should not be searching for the msi for version 1.3.33.\nIt should only need the msi for version 1.3.34 and should complete the upgrade.\n\nAdditional Builds and Platforms:\n\nI suspect this will occur on any windows machine where 1.3.33 is already\ninstalled, but I do not have the facilities to test this.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nThe documentation doesn't say anything about uninstalling to upgrade between\nminor revisions, and the installer seems to support what I'm doing. Is this a\ndocumentation problem?\n\nI know this problem has been reported to you in previous versions, but not for\nthis version, and I have not found any resolutions. In light of this, I thought\nI should report it again."}]
