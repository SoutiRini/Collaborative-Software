This is done by a class called OOXmlLite, which runs the unit tests and looks which classes have been loaded.\n\nUnfortunately the CTVectorVariant class doesn't seem to be referenced from any unit test, that is why it is not loaded to poi-ooxml-schemas.\n\nI created a unit test class that uses the CTVectorVariant. This allows it to be discovered by OOXmlLite, The patch is attached.", "id": 136246, "time": "2010-04-19T11:21:36Z", "bug_id": 49153, "creation_time": "2010-04-19T11:21:36Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25324}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49153, "is_private": false, "id": 136247, "attachment_id": 25325, "creator": "antoni.mylka@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-04-19T11:22:32Z", "time": "2010-04-19T11:22:32Z", "text": "Created attachment 25325\na test case, to be placed in test-data/document"}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "text": "Fixed in r935860\n\nYegor", "id": 136251, "time": "2010-04-20T06:28:57Z", "bug_id": 49153, "creation_time": "2010-04-20T06:28:57Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
