The block overlaps the content that comes after it in the fo:inline. It's not the space-before that is not taken into account since the rendering is wrong even without it. The space-before just makes the problem more obvious.\n\nThe problem disappears if one of the fo:inline is removed, or replaced with an fo:wrapper.\n\nA quick debugging session showed that the problem lies somewhere in the area tree.
