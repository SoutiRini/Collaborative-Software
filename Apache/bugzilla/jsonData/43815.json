The structure of the FO files is quite \nstarnge because a mixture of tables and list blocks are used to achieve what \ncould probably be achieved with a straight list. Still the FO is valid and my \ncustomer asked why the bullet does not line up with the text. The list blocks \nand table are children of a block-container which has position=\"absolute\" but \ndoes not have width/height properties specified. If the width/height \nproperties are added then the bullet points then line up with the text! So our \nBC LM must expect width/height and if they are not specified it can cause \nstrange layout effects on the child LMs."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43815, "attachment_id": 21096, "id": 110336, "time": "2007-11-08T09:06:43Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-11-08T09:06:43Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 21096\nFO to reproduce problem"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "FWIW: bug seems to be fixed in current FOP trunk (probably also 0.95).\n\nI suspect the issue has been fixed with Jeremias' refactoring of BlockViewport handling...\n\nChris, can you confirm, so that we may close this one?", "attachment_id": null, "id": 116227, "creation_time": "2008-05-04T22:46:35Z", "time": "2008-05-04T22:46:35Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "bug_id": 43815, "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43815, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 116293, "time": "2008-05-06T04:48:16Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-05-06T04:48:16Z", "text": "Thanks everyone - this bug is fixed!"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43815, "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 155774, "time": "2012-04-01T06:40:00Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:40:00Z", "is_private": false}]
