This prevents shell from disappearing. I know this works\nfor XP  and window server 2003. Here is the help \nEXIT\n\nQuits the CMD.EXE program (command interpreter) or the current batch\nscript.\n\nEXIT [/B] [exitCode]\n\n  /B          specifies to exit the current batch script instead of\n              CMD.EXE.
