[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47518, "is_private": false, "text": "It appears that the Valve interface javadoc hasn't been updated since around TC 5.5. Here is a snip of what it currently available from TC's website (6.0.20 I would guess):\n\n\"\n# If the corresponding Response was not generated (and control was not returned, call the next Valve in the pipeline (if there is one) by executing context.invokeNext().\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n# Modify the HTTP headers included with the Response after the invokeNext() method has returned.\n# Perform any actions on the output stream associated with the specified Response after the invokeNext() method has returned.\n\"\n\nThe invokeNext method has not existed in the Valve interface in many versions. I believe the replacement is:\n\nthis.getNext().invoke(request, response)\n\nI'm happy to provide a doc patch if getNext().invoke(request, response) is the expected replacement for invokeNext(request, response).\n\nNote that the docs for 5.5 also have the same problem.
