The same request when executed from SOAP UI is taking less than 1 seconds whereas when executed from Jmeter its taking more than 5 minutes.  i tried to prepare script with HTTP request and there i m getting reponse time of 1 second. \n\nI dont understand why its taking more time for web service request sampler in Jmeter.
