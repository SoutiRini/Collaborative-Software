But the directives apply to all certificates used by the vhost.\n\nSSLStaplingForceURL is the most likely concern AFAIK, and even that would be a rare issue since overriding the responder URL is uncommon and multiple certificates per vhost is uncommon.\n\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslstaplingforceurl\n\nI don't think this is a present concern."}]
