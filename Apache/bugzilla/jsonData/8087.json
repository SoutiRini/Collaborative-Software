I have implemented \nthe methods attributeAdded(..) and attributeRemoved(..).\n\nThe problem occurs, when session cookies are disabled and therefore URL \nrewriting is forced. The method attributeRemoved() gets NEVER called, when \nTomcat is doing URL rewriting. It works perfect when cookies are allowed. The \nmethod attributeAdded() works perfect in BOTH situations (cookies or URL \nrewriting).\n\nI have tested this on several machines using MS IE 5.5 SP2 and Netscape 6.2. I \ncan reproduce it as many times as you want.\n\nI have postet this on the tomcat-user list but have not got any reply. You can \nfind the message here:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/tomcat-user%40jakarta.apache.org/msg50890.html\n\nAdditional info:\n\nI use STRUTS and VELOCITY to implement my MVC. I use JBuilder 6 on Win2K as my \ndevelopment environment. My application is very large, uses CORBA and a SYBASE \ndatabase server which also holds a lot of configuration information. Therefore \nI cannot send you the application but I could try to debug it, if you could \ngive me a hint where to search. (I am not familiar with the source tree of \nTOMCAT)\n\nPlease let me know if I can be of any further assistance.\n\nThomas"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "A test case was built for this bug and tested against 4.1.2, and it appears to\nbe working now.\nThis may have been caused by problems with URL rewriting.", "is_private": false, "id": 16295, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "time": "2002-05-17T02:49:34Z", "bug_id": 8087, "creation_time": "2002-05-17T02:49:34Z", "attachment_id": null}]
