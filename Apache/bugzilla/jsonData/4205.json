[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "gb@opengroup.org", "text": "I am currently using ant to checkout a load of projects from CVS and then javac'ing the code that I check out.However I have noticed a few times that the checkout of a single project may fail and then my compile fails, leaving me with about 100 errors.  The problem is that the actual error occurs way up near the top of the target and I have to spend quite a while looking for the root cause.So the enhancement, it would be good to have a similar function to the javac task for cvs (and perhaps others) to exit the build when an error occurs.  This would save a large amount of trouble in the build process.It may be that this can be made more generic, so that there is an attribute on the <target> tag that indicates whether the execution of the target should be stopped if an error occurs, maybe when a task throws an exception...Cheers,Gary", "id": 6758, "time": "2001-10-16T10:24:08Z", "bug_id": 4205, "creation_time": "2001-10-16T10:24:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "<cvs> supports the failonerror attribute, it is just lacking documentation, sorry.\nShould work in Ant 1.4 (and probably since Ant 1.2 or so).\nDocumentation has been patched for nightly build 2001-10-20.", "is_private": false, "id": 6881, "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "time": "2001-10-19T01:53:53Z", "bug_id": 4205, "creation_time": "2001-10-19T01:53:53Z", "attachment_id": null}]
