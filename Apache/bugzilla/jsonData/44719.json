When viewing the resulting SVGs in Squiggle, only a portion or none of their contents are visible in the viewport. Using the Adobe SVG viewer, in some cases, it is possible to zoom out and see the full contents of the image, although sometimes the image is flipped upside-down and aligned to the bottom right corner.  See the attached zip file for examples of the original WMFs and their incorrectly rendered SVG counterparts after running them through the WMFTranscoder."}]
