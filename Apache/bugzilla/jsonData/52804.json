Implementing a routing datasource based on something like org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.AbstractDataSource can then just clone a PoolProperties object and set the one or two properties that differ in the clone. In a spring project the properties that are common across all the datasources are only supplied once."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52804, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 154415, "time": "2012-03-01T20:20:38Z", "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-03-01T20:20:38Z", "text": "Fixed in trunk in r1295768\nFixed in 7.0.x in r1295770"}]
