That's because there's only 2 list items. To honour the 2em limits both items must be kept together. \n\nIf I alter the test case so that there are several items in column 1 that naturally flows 1 item onto column 2 then the fox:widow-content-limit extension is demo'd more readily. The last item from column 1 is then moved to column 2 to honour the widow limit. If I then add the forced break back to the last item then the last item on column 1 goes back to column 1. This shows that the forced break does work in some scenarios at least. I have uploaded 2 further test cases; 1 with the forced break and 1 without.\n\nIn conclusion it seems there is a bug with forced breaks not being honoured in all circumstances and your patch seems to fix it, but I'm not 100% certain if that's the correct solution. It probably needs to be reviewed by one of the layout gurus.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": 28167, "text": "Created attachment 28167\nImproved Test Case with no break", "id": 152891, "time": "2012-01-18T15:24:22Z", "bug_id": 52287, "creation_time": "2012-01-18T15:24:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52287, "attachment_id": 28168, "id": 152892, "time": "2012-01-18T15:24:48Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-18T15:24:48Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 28168\nImproved test Case with forced break"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52287, "id": 157448, "time": "2012-04-07T01:43:02Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:43:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 157693, "time": "2012-04-08T09:11:05Z", "bug_id": 52287, "creation_time": "2012-04-08T09:11:05Z", "is_private": false, "text": "increase priority due to presence of a patch"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52287, "is_private": false, "count": 7, "id": 157713, "time": "2012-04-08T21:19:37Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-08T21:19:37Z", "text": "matthias, could you create a new patch that combines the code changes with the new test cases being placed into test/layoutengine/standard-testcases? i will then commit the patch"}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52287, "attachment_id": null, "id": 158359, "time": "2012-04-24T05:54:35Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-24T05:54:35Z", "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #7)\n> matthias, could you create a new patch that combines the code changes with the\n> new test cases being placed into test/layoutengine/standard-testcases? i will\n> then commit the patch\n\nMatthias, I am still awaiting your input as requested above. if I see no further input by April 30, I will close this bug due to lack of requested information.
