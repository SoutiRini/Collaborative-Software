PDF files employ three string types:\n\n(1) byte string (unspecified encoding)\n(2) ascii string (us-ascii encoding)\n(3) text string (either PDFDocEncoding or UTF-16BE)\n\nSince (1) the encode() mechanism is used in a variety of contexts and (2) no explicit use of UTF-8 is made by PDF, it would be incorrect to simply change the output encoding returned by encode().\n\nSee ISO/IEC 32000 (2008), Section 7.9.2 for details.\n\nThis patch needs to be reworked to take these details into account. Furthermore, the description of this bug is not adequate: it really doesn't explain what the problem is:\n\n* is it the fact that the rendered text of the content of basic-link is not rendered with Polish characters? if so, then the problem is a font selection problem, not a character encoding problem\n\n* is it related to the character encoding used in the /Filespec dictionary for the link annotation?\n\nIn any case, the present patch MUST NOT be applied."}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49849, "attachment_id": null, "text": "see comment 5", "id": 157033, "time": "2012-04-01T21:09:51Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T21:09:51Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 49849, "id": 157351, "time": "2012-04-07T01:41:47Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:41:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49849, "attachment_id": null, "id": 158361, "time": "2012-04-24T05:56:11Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-24T05:56:11Z", "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #6)\n> see comment 5\n\nMax, I am still awaiting your input as requested above. if I see no further input by April 30, I will close this bug due to lack of requested information.
