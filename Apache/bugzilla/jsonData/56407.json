Quoting from http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcertificatefile:\n\n\"This directive points to a file with certificate data in PEM format. At a minimum, the file must include an end-entity (leaf) certificate. Beginning with version 2.4.8, it may also include intermediate CA certificates, sorted from leaf to root, and obsoletes SSLCertificateChainFile.\"\n\nI.e., to update your configuration to no longer rely on SSLCertificateChainFile, you need to append the contents of the chain file to those already in SSLCertificateFile.\n\nI'm closing this bug, as the warning message itself is correct. If there's something in the documentation which could be improved, then let us know.", "attachment_id": null}]
