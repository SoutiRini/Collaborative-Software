The first assertion is \ncorrectly recorded in the log as failed - however the HTTP sample shows as \nbeing in success and the thread continues.\n\nExpected Results: \nWhen the first Response Assertion is triggered/fails on a pattern, set the HTTP \nRequest sample to be in error and stop the thread. The documented behaviour of \nthe \"Ignore Status\" does not indicate that preceding assertions are effectively \nignored if this value is set.\n\n\nBuild/Platform:\nWindows XP SP2\nJava 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition build 1.5.0_06-b05\nApache JMeter version 2.1.1\n\nThanks"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "This is behaving as designed.\n\nThe documentation states:\n\n\"When the Ignore Status checkbox is selected, the Response status is forced to\nsuccessful before evaluating the Assertion.\"\n\nThe purpose of the checkbox is to allow the response status to be checked, even\nif  the request has failed, e.g. it allows one to check for a 404.", "id": 86365, "time": "2006-03-02T03:08:15Z", "bug_id": 38824, "creation_time": "2006-03-02T03:08:15Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 38824, "is_private": false, "id": 86376, "time": "2006-03-02T04:53:51Z", "creator": "deane.sloan@equinox.co.nz", "creation_time": "2006-03-02T04:53:51Z", "tags": [], "text": "Thanks - \n\nProbably led astray a bit by the doco statement \"There is no difference between \nsetting up one Assertion with multiple patterns and setting up multiple \nAssertions with one pattern each (assuming the other options are the same). \" - \nthe statement seems to be incorrect based on your response and observations."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "deane.sloan@equinox.co.nz", "is_private": false, "text": "My bad - created a contrived example presuming the issue was a bug rather than \na doco thing.\n\nSimply put - splitting a check where you want to make your own determination \nabout HTTP 400+/500+ responses into multiple response assertions using \"Ignore \nStatus\" won't reliably work - the patterns need to be in the one response \nassertion.\n\nThe documentation around response assertion has a statement that would lead you \nto believe otherwise (\"There is no difference between...\"). \nJust a minor doco thing - but still has the same impact if you made the choice \nto split your assertion up based on the statement...\n\nBTW - this seemed like a viable approach to let a known HTTP 500 error through \nfor a period of time by trapping everything but... \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.\n", "id": 86381, "time": "2006-03-02T09:25:03Z", "bug_id": 38824, "creation_time": "2006-03-02T09:25:03Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38824, "attachment_id": null, "id": 86391, "time": "2006-03-02T12:38:35Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-03-02T12:38:35Z", "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #2)\n> Thanks - \n> Probably led astray a bit by the doco statement \"There is no difference \nbetween \n> setting up one Assertion with multiple patterns and setting up multiple \n> Assertions with one pattern each (assuming the other options are the \nsame). \" - \n> the statement seems to be incorrect based on your response and observations.\n\nYour example did not use the same options..."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38824, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 86392, "time": "2006-03-02T12:40:02Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-03-02T12:40:02Z", "text": "I'll see about improving the documentation for the check-box."}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38824, "attachment_id": null, "id": 88675, "time": "2006-04-30T16:59:46Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-04-30T16:59:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Documentation has been updated.\n\nIgnore Status should only be used on the first Assertion"}]
