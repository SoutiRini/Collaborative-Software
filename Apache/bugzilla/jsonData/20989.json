I have\napproximately 220 virtual hosts running on a vanilla Apache system.  Users create\n.htaccess files, which are honored by the server.  However, the AuthUserFile's\nare never accessed by the server for verification.  I have conducted a number of\ntests to come to this conclusion, including comparing the behavior to a system\nwith out virtual hosts.  Monitoring the access times on the .htaccess and\n.htpasswd files shows that Apache is hitting the .htaccess file, but regardless\nof where the .htpasswd file is placed, it is never accessed.  All the usual\nsuspects have been checked, permissions, httpd.conf, etc.\n\nAccording to some Google searching, I am not the only user experiencing\ndifficulties like this.  The error log shows (assuming we're using user\n'testme', and the directory being protected is '/test' off the DocumentRoot)\n\"User testme not found: /test\".  In the .htaccess file, I've tried absolute\npaths, relative paths from DocumentRoot, etc.  Including placing a .htpasswd\nfile in /tmp, which is world readable and writeable.\n\nI will be happy to apply suggestions for debugging, and test any patches.  This\nis on a Debian system with a 2.4.18 kernel.
