However, an issue has cropped up where FallbackResource seems to work incorrectly. I.e., this URL works fine:\n\nhttp://arewemeetingyet.com/Brisbane/2014-03-16/22:00/foo/bar\n\nAll state for the app is contained in the URL, and in this case the state is a little bit invalid, in that the fourth URL path component is supposed to contain the title. As such, clicking the \"Use as template\" link, then the \"Go to URL\" button yields this similar but different URL:\n\nhttp://arewemeetingyet.com/Brisbane/2014-03-16/22:00/foo%2Fbar\n\nHowever, upon requesting this, Apache throws a 404 Not Found error. Since \"Brisbane\" is definitely not a directory in the DocumentRoot for this (nor are \"foo\" or \"bar\", BTW), it seems like this should fall back exactly like the first address.", "id": 177600, "time": "2014-09-07T10:31:26Z", "creator": "djc@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-09-07T10:31:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 177602, "time": "2014-09-07T11:22:43Z", "bug_id": 56922, "creation_time": "2014-09-07T11:22:43Z", "tags": [], "text": "Do you have AllowEncodedSlashes set?"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56922, "attachment_id": null, "text": "That seems to have done the trick.
