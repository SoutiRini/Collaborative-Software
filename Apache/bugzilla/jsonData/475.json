This means that the call to getServerSocketFactory() in the processConnection() method of HttpConnectionHandler is calling the method from the PoolTcpConnecter superclass, which will always return null because the subclass overrides the setter method.\r\n\r\nAt least, that is what it seems like to me!", "id": 443, "time": "2001-01-18T13:11:46Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-01-18T13:11:46Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "cmanolache@yahoo.com", "is_private": false, "id": 501, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 475, "creation_time": "2001-02-01T23:18:30Z", "time": "2001-02-01T23:18:30Z", "text": "Resolved in the main tree.
