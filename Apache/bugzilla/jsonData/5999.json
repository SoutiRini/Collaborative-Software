If your file from -Dlog4j.configuration=<file> is not in your \nclasspath, then it won't be found.  Also, the first file named <file> in your classpath is \nthe one that is found.\n\nSo, the question is:\n\nWhy is log4j finding the wrong configuration file or not finding my configuration file \nwhen I use -Dlog4j.configuration=<file>?\n\nAnswer:\nThe log4j.configuration property prompts log4j to search in your classpath for the file \nyou give as the property value.  If you don't put the directory containing your \nconfiguration file in your classpath (often you want to use '.', your current working \ndirectory, so just prepend . to your classpath), then log4j won't find the file.  Also, \nlog4j searches your classpath in order for the file name listed.  So if you have \nanother file of the same name lurking out there somewhere in your classpath, log4j \nmay not be using the configuration file you think it should be using."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "text": "\nWill do.", "id": 11761, "time": "2002-03-13T21:31:21Z", "bug_id": 5999, "creation_time": "2002-03-13T21:31:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
