I think the intention was to use GB as the country code. GB is the iso country code for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Java Locale class doesn't really make this very clear by defining a constant called UK for the en,GB locale. See http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/util/Locale.java.html#481\n\nPlease update the example in the manual to have the locale set to \"en,GB\"."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mfaltaie@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 29993\nPatch for doc fix\n\nAdded a patch to fix this.
