This only occurs when moving any of the three percentile columns.\n\nIf you move any of them to swap places with another percentile column, the titles will switch.  For example, if you were to move the \"99% Line\" column between the \"90% Line\" and \"95% Line\" columns, it would swap titles with the \"95% Line\" column.  The data remains the same, only the column title changes.\n\nIf any of the percentile columns are move past the \"Median\" or \"Min\" columns, they get changed to be titled \"{0}% Line\".  I attached a picture of this occurring when moving the \"99% Line\" column past the \"Min\" column.\n\nAgain, to clarify, this problem only occurs for the percentile columns in the Aggregate Report.  The data in the columns is moved properly, it is just the title that is erroneously changed."}]
