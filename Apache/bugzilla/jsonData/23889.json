[{"count": 0, "text": "Hello everybody,\n\nI'd like to see a \"preservelastmodified\" option for the \"javac\" task (similar to\n\"preservelastmodified\" in \"copy\"). The current situation is that, if I delete an\noutput file (.class) and invoke \"javac\" once more, the new .class file has got\nthe current date and is detected as new by all following tasks.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndreas", "bug_id": 23889, "attachment_id": null, "id": 45831, "time": "2003-10-17T12:19:00Z", "creator": "apache.org@schildbach.de", "creation_time": "2003-10-17T12:19:00Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "stevel@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 46092, "time": "2003-10-22T22:33:35Z", "bug_id": 23889, "creation_time": "2003-10-22T22:33:35Z", "text": "two issues here\n(a) compilation is done by various tools -like javac- that even add in new files\nto compile if they are imported. So ant doesnt even know all the files that will\nbe compiled.\n\n(b) I have trouble thinking of valid use cases. It is too dangerous to do this,\nas suddenly dependencies dont get picked up. And it wont work the way you want,\nas inter-class dependencies complicate the game. \n\nIf your compiler is slow, get jikes, from jikes.org. "}]
