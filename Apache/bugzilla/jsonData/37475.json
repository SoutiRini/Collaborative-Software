Instead what <import> does is\n\n-import files at a time when all preceeding properties have been resolved.\n-import complete ant projects, not XML fragments.\n-have rules for overriding and invoking targets across multiple build files.\n\nthe latter is where <import> really wins out. \n\nI understand your need, but <import> isnt the solution. \n\nIf you have a custom ant task and want to enable reuse of core bits of it, try\ncreating custom ant datatypes. If it is someone else's task, look at using\npresetdef and macrodef. \n\nI'm marking this as wontfix, though think maybe we should rename it and open it\nas a feature request, \"add way of importing XML under tasks/targets\", without\nimplying it is a specific  failing of import."}]
