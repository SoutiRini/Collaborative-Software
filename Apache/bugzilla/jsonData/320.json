Also I prepared primitive sender \u2013 class. This class only reads file and sends it to the servlet. \r\nI can send file with size under 8K in a loop so many times, as I want.\r\nWith size under 80K I can send only one ore two times. \r\nThen client just hangs up.\r\nWith size more than 80K I can not send at all.\r\nAccording documentation of tomcat I tried to use for JVM parameters \u2013Xmx \u2013Xms. I also tried to configure thread pool. It does not help much. \r\nTo be sure that I do not have problems with my servlet and client, I have installed jrun and have done the same experiment with jrun. With jrun I can send file with size 1M and more in a loop without any problems. It looks like to me, that I did not tune something for Tomcat.  \r\n"}]
