[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18266, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Using mod_proxy as part of the 1.3.27 distribution of apache.\n\nWhen trying to upload a file to a https website via an apache proxy, the \nbrowser fails.  Different browsers give different errors - MSIE gives a 'Cannot \nfind server or DNS Error' page, netscape v4.8 says 'connection reset by peer'.  \n(I've noticed that MSIE always gives that error no matter what the problem.)\n\nSeems odd given that https proxying is completely transparent.  i.e. it just \nconnects the client->proxy connection with the proxy->server with no \ninterference, right?  This error only occurs with file uploads - i.e. when the \nrequest buffer is larger than usual.\n\nThis error occurs when using a apache as a proxy to another apache internal \nserver and also when using an external site running Microsoft-IIS/5.0.\n\nI wish i could give a url to recreate this bug but of course the pages are \nsecure for a good reason :)\n\nA way to recreate this page is to host the following html on a https server \n(called test.html) and then use an apache server as a proxy from your browser:\n\n<form action=\"test.html\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\n<input type=\"file\" name=\"test_file\"/>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"submit\"/>\n</form>\n\nIf you get a \"Method not allowed\" then that is fine because the file has been \nuploaded to a page which is not dynamic but at least the http request has \nfinished in that case.\n\nThe error when proxying appears so quickly, that I am sure that there has not \nbeen enough time to send the entire request.\n\nTo whomever looks after these bugs:  thanks - apache has the least bugs in any \nsoftware I have ever found.  I've been using it for years and this is my first \nbug :-)", "id": 33666, "time": "2003-03-24T06:28:43Z", "creator": "neil.wilkinson@transport.nsw.gov.au", "creation_time": "2003-03-24T06:28:43Z", "is_private": false}]
