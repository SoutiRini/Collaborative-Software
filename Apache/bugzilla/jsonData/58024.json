Therefore, the file deletion does not occur until the last handle to the file is closed.\"\n\nI read this \"does not occur until the last handle is closed\" as \"occurs only when the last handle is closed\", but I must be naive, since:\n\n\"The DeleteFile function fails if an application attempts to delete a file that has other handles open for normal I/O or as a memory-mapped file (FILE_SHARE_DELETE must have been specified when other handles were opened).\"\n\nwhich seems to indicate that it fails for memory-mapped files *even if* FILE_SHARE_DELETE was used (i.e. FILE_SHARE_DELETE helps only for \"other handles opened\" but not for memory-mapped files)...\n\nIf that's the case, it quite complicates things since we have to address the filesystem leak too.\n\nLet me talk about this on the dev@ mailing list for Windows gurus to help me out (FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE? that would require our own slotmem_shm_create() for Windows specifics).\n\nAnyway, the debug traces (with your personal logs in slotmem_cleanup about destroy/remove returned values) could help here to confirm what happens at deletion time.\nAlso, these traces with and without attachment 33052 applied could possibly help.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 185224, "creation_time": "2015-09-14T13:15:09Z", "time": "2015-09-14T13:15:09Z", "creator": "ylavic.dev@gmail.com", "bug_id": 58024, "is_private": false}, {"count": 25, "tags": [], "text": "Stresstest looks good.\nIntil now, it made about 270 restarts with many random configuration changes.
