Ie AAA is greater than B.\n\nWhat has not been done is to DOCUMENT this bug; ie there ought to be something in docs/manual/mod/mod_rewrite.html.en near line 527 that describes this strange behaviour; and that the fix is to use ap_expr. The bug is not present with case independent compare (flag NC).\n\nIf asked I will produce a patch to the documentation"}]
