Otherwise logging appends as expected.\n\nThe root cause of the error is not a common library and the issue was found by reviewing the package name of the exception (e.g. com.sites.app_a.session).\n\nI pulled down the ear file and confirmed the log4j.xml files are correct and the JBoss instances have been bounced", "id": 152943, "time": "2012-01-19T17:37:43Z", "creator": "scarycomputer@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-19T17:37:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
