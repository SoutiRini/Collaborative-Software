[{"text": "Created attachment 29767\npatch\n\nThe problem appears in version 1.8.4 and in revision 1421898.  I\nattached a one-line patch that fixes it.\n\nIn method \"FileUtils.isContextRelativePath\", the call\n\"filename.indexOf(':') == 1\" should be \"filename.charAt(1) == ':'\"\n(the first character is a letter as checked by \"Character.isLetter(c)\"\nearlier in the boolean expression).  In the entire method, \"charAt\" is\nalready used 3 different times to check the values of characters 0, 1,\nand 2 (while \"indexOf\" just once, in the instance described above).\nThese existing 3 calls to \"charAt\" make the string pattern being\nchecked for more explicit.  Also, \"charAt\" is more efficient than\n\"indexOf\", because \"charAt\" reads only a single character at a given\nposition, while \"indexOf\" searches until the first occurrence.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 54305, "attachment_id": 29767, "count": 0, "id": 164080, "time": "2012-12-14T23:35:07Z", "creator": "nistor1@illinois.edu", "creation_time": "2012-12-14T23:35:07Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54305, "attachment_id": null, "text": "svn revision 1554813", "id": 172037, "time": "2014-01-02T14:40:57Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-01-02T14:40:57Z", "is_private": false}]
