We\nhave written an application that requires the ability to adjust the size of this\nbuffer.\n\nI have tried using apr_socket_opt_set, unfortunately the buffer size must be\nmodified prior to connect() or accept() (at least on Linux...).\n\nI will follow up with a patch to support this functionality.  It's a very\nstraightforward change, and I've added English documentation for the new\ndirective.  It would be great to see it added!\n\nThanks."}, {"id": 78137, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36038, "attachment_id": 15898, "count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 15898\nPatch for new ReceiveBufferSize directive", "time": "2005-08-05T09:09:35Z", "creator": "murray@cpan.org", "creation_time": "2005-08-05T09:09:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"id": 111073, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36038, "attachment_id": null, "count": 2, "text": "code\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=157583\ndocument\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=280384", "time": "2007-11-25T01:40:06Z", "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "creation_time": "2007-11-25T01:40:06Z", "is_private": false}]
