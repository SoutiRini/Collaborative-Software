[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48369, "text": "The original mod_fastcgi, on which mod_fcgid is based (if I understand my history correctly), has an option (named autoUpdate, which is a flag to to the FastCgiConfig) which causes it to check the mtime of a script each time that script is requested, and restart the process handling that script if the script has been modified since the handler process was started.  mod_fcgid does not have such capability, but it would be very useful in a shared hosting environment for development, as our users do not have access to the server to kill processes.\n\nVarious workarounds are possible but not desirable because:\n-setting DefaultMinClassProcessCount to 0 and letting the script idle timeout leads to lots of sitting and waiting\n-setting very low MaxRequestsPerProcess, IdleTimeout, or ProcessLifetime results in inefficient, needless stopping and starting\n\nIf such functionality is not in the works I __might__ be able to write a patch to do this, if there is a chance it would be accepted.\n\nThank you.", "id": 132734, "time": "2009-12-10T14:11:25Z", "creator": "nlshep@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-12-10T14:11:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
