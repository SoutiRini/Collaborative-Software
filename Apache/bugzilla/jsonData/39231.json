[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39231, "text": "The issue is that the custom JAAS's LoginModule.logout() method is never \ncalled. I guess this has been never implemented correctly (at least since \nTomcat 5.5.9).\n\nThe thing is that according to the JAAS spec, the LoginContext.logout() is \nsupposed to invoke the logout method for each LoginModule configured for this \nLoginContext.\n\nSo, somebody should be sure to call LoginContext.logout() method. The caller \nfor this method could be either a server or a client. \n\nSo, either Tomcat should provide some means to access the LoginContext to the \nclients, or Tomcat should take the responsibility to call this method by itself.\n\nI guess the solution could be for Tomcat to associate the instance of \nLoginContext with the user's session, and then Tomcat could invoke \nLoginContext.logout() when the session is being invalidated (both when the \nsession times out or invalidated explicitely).\n\nI hope that I am correctly interpreting the JAAS spec.", "id": 87652, "time": "2006-04-06T21:19:49Z", "creator": "seva_popov@tvworks.com", "creation_time": "2006-04-06T21:19:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39231, "text": "1.

Currently, this is a \nproblem because the LoginContext is created in the JAASRealm and discarded \nafter login is called and the only place that the session is available is in \nthe Authenticator.\n\nHere is a proposed solution:\n\n1) Create a pojo that has getPrincipal() and getLoginContext().  Let's call \nthis pojo, RealmPrincipal.\n\n2) Change the Realm's authenticate methods to return a RealmPrincipal object \ninstead of a Principal.\n\n3) Change the Realm impl's to create and return the RealmPrincipal, including \nthe LoginContext where appropriate.\n\n4) Change the Authentcator's to check to see if the LoginContext is not null \nand add it to the session notes the same as currently is being done with the \nprincipal.\n\n5) Change the StandardSession expires() method to check for the LoginContext \nin the notes and call logout on it, if it is present.\n\n\nI hope this is clear and sufficient for a timely fix.
