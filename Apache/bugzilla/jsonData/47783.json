This is explained further in the Caching Guide. In particular, this module's cache is per-process\", but in this note and in the Caching Guide (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/caching.html#inmemory), the text is not clear about the ramifications of mod_mem_cache being per-process.\n\nThe comment at the end of issue 39454 by Ruediger Pluem on 2006-05-01 09:56:05 PDT (https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=39454) gives a good idea about this.\n\nIf the documentation can add just an additional sentence to make it clear that if mod_mem_cache is to be used instead of mod_disk_cache, the recommendation is to favor lower number of processes and higher threads per process so that mod_mem_cache can work efficiently since multiple cached copies will most likely  result in the machine's memory, one for each process."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 24206\ndoc diff\n\nquick pass at update, comments?", "id": 130137, "time": "2009-09-03T08:13:14Z", "bug_id": 47783, "creation_time": "2009-09-03T08:13:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 24206}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47783, "is_private": false, "id": 130144, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "stoehr@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-09-04T06:51:09Z", "time": "2009-09-04T06:51:09Z", "text": "(In reply to comment #1)\n> Created an attachment (id=24206) [details]\n> doc diff\n> \n> quick pass at update, comments?\n\nLooks great.
