MultiViews is enabled for the user directory\n2. In the user directory there is any file beginning with the username (e.g. username.css, username.php etc.)\n3.

It should look for script alternatives.\n\nIt should look for alternatives of /user/home/dir/public_html/subdir/script.php\nand not for alternative version of /user/home/dir/public_html/username\nI do not how this could be done, since Apache does not know that the first path part\nis the username etc.\n\nBecause of this bug one can not use PHP with cgi-wrapper (since PHP uses now PATH_TRANSLATED\nwhen looking for script to run) IF MultiViews is enabled.", "id": 43080, "time": "2003-08-21T08:26:08Z", "creator": "makler+bugs@man.torun.pl", "creation_time": "2003-08-21T08:26:08Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22618, "text": "Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x is not supported anymore and no bugs will be fixed in the old codebase (cf. <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201002.mbox/%3C20100203000334.GA19021@infiltrator.stdlib.net%3E>).
