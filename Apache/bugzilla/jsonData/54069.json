Perhaps this is introduced by bug 53713?\n\nThis is easy to reproduce. Create a jsp file with the following contents:\n---\nStart of page.\n\t<%----------------------------%>\n\t<%-- Blah blah blah         --%>\n\t<%----------------------------%>\nEnd of page.\n---\nVisit this jsp page with 7.0.32 and 7.0.30 and see the difference.\n\nI've been looking at the jsp specs to see if <%----------------------------%> might be invalid; perhaps a space is mandatory following the two dashes.
