It extends Javac, to accept \na \"modulelist\" FileSet from the build.xml.  Each module in the list is \nbasically a source directory.  The JavacModuleTask.execute() method goes \nthrough each module and gets some info on it.  It then sets the Srcdir to the \nnext module directory and runs super.execute().  This won't work as the API is \nnow because the \"Path src\" attribute can't be reset so it keeps growing, and \nthe project is so big the system eventually runs out of resources if I try to \ncompile all my source directories at once.\n\nFor now I ended up modifying org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Javac so that \nthe \"Path src\" attribute was protected instead of private.  I then wrote \na \"resetSrcdir()\" method in my subclass that simply set src to null.  The \nresetSrcdir() listed above is probably a better implementation in most cases.\n\nThanks for looking at this!  \n-Brian\n\n", "attachment_id": null, "id": 5774, "creator": "bmoriarty@polexis.com", "time": "2001-09-19T10:47:13Z", "bug_id": 3703, "creation_time": "2001-09-19T10:47:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "I have added the following method into CVS:\n>     protected Path recreateSrc() {\n>         src = null;\n>         return createSrc();\n>     }\nPlease reopen the PR if this doesn't help you enough.\n", "is_private": false, "id": 8706, "creator": "umagesh@apache.org", "time": "2001-12-07T13:05:19Z", "bug_id": 3703, "creation_time": "2001-12-07T13:05:19Z", "attachment_id": null}]
