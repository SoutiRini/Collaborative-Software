[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27586, "text": "I did a bugzilla query on this bug, but it doesn't appear to be submitted yet.\n\nThe bug occurs when using the Event API for HSSF in\norg.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel.  For each record type, the first listener\nthat is added to HSSFRequest gets registered, but subsequent listeners (for a\nrecord type with an existing listener) do not get registered.\n\nIf you look at org.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel.HSSFRequest.addListener() line\n74 the cause is obvious.  The fix, of course, is to add the following line:\n\nlist.add(lsnr);\n\nSeems too trivial to submit a test case to reproduce this bug, so I'll leave it\nout.  Don't want to offend your intelligence.  It's just surprising to me that\nthis hasn't been submitted yet.\n\nHope this helps.  Keep up the good work, I'm looking forward to seeing a\nmemory-tweaked POI 3.0 because I manipulate large spreadsheets.\n\n-jw", "count": 0, "id": 53844, "time": "2004-03-10T22:25:05Z", "creator": "jwang@ms.soph.uab.edu", "creation_time": "2004-03-10T22:25:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27586, "text": "This is fixed since ages, at least as long as I could look up SVN history...", "count": 1, "id": 169089, "time": "2013-08-04T19:43:24Z", "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2013-08-04T19:43:24Z", "is_private": false}]
