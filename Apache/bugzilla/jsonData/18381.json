The jsp contains page directives in multiple lines. What is \nhappening here, while jsp is being compiled, it puts the carriagefeed in \nthe .dat file and puts spaces in produced html file(i.e if you see in .java \nfile, the reference to _jsp_html_data[0] to [5]. in case of five import \nstatements)\nBecause of this the generated pdf report is getting corrupted.\nThe logic shall be if there is a carriage feed or line feed from the end of tag \nto the starting of tag, the compiler shall not put the carriage feed info \nin .dat file.\n\nIf any one needs more info pls email me. \n\nThanks,\n\nBhaskar", "id": 33841, "time": "2003-03-26T18:30:09Z", "bug_id": 18381, "creation_time": "2003-03-26T18:30:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hans@gefionsoftware.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 33844, "time": "2003-03-26T18:38:16Z", "bug_id": 18381, "creation_time": "2003-03-26T18:38:16Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The JSP specification specifically defines the behavior you describe.
