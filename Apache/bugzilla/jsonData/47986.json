[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47986, "text": "Ref: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxybadheader\n\nThe ProxyBadHeader is unclear about which response status header lines it is referring. Although it can be inferred that a 'response' belongs to the backend/remote server it could be confused with the client request ones.\n\nI'm unsure about the wording: the introduction on proxy states that for a forward proxy the remote is a /origin server/, while for a reverse proxy that would be a /back-end server/. Maybe 'remote server' is a fit for both cases. Then maybe the short description \"Determines how to handle bad header lines in a response\" could be rephrased as \"Determines how to handle bad header lines in a response from a remote server\". Which helps immediatly realize that this option refers to the client part of the proxy.\n\nSimilarly the long description could explictly say \"[...] if it receives syntactically invalid header lines (i.e. containing no colon) from a remote origin (forward proxy) or back-end (reverse proxy) server.\" (maybe akward I guess)\n\nAnd by the way, looking at httpd-2.2.x/modules/proxy show that ProxyBadHeader is internally stored as proxy_server_conf.badopt althouth it is only used in http_proxy.c. Since this option looks HTTP-specific (and not a fit for AJP or FTP), shouln't it be moved to the http_proxy doc ?", "id": 131090, "time": "2009-10-12T14:26:05Z", "creator": "vcaron@bearstech.com", "creation_time": "2009-10-12T14:26:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47986, "attachment_id": null, "id": 141183, "time": "2010-10-29T11:05:29Z", "creator": "rbowen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-29T11:05:29Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Moving docs bugs to docs@httpd.a.o ownership."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47986, "text": "thanks for the report, tweaked/emphasized a bit.", "id": 141480, "time": "2010-11-05T10:21:18Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-11-05T10:21:18Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
