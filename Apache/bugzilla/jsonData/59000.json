Indeed it can be quite useful.\n\nDisallowing all appends would break customer scripts that rely on the behaviour; we cannot arbitrarily change how JMeter works.", "id": 188400, "time": "2016-02-13T14:01:05Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-02-13T14:01:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
