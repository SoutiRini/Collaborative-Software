This patched binder has hardcoded dependency on JMeter's LogkitLoggerFactory, which itself depends on Jorphan and logkit.\n\nThis causes slf4j binding conflicts in our application making any JMeter 3.0 maven artifact unusable as dependency:\n\nSLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/home/ubuntu/.m2/repository/org/apache/jmeter/ApacheJMeter_core/3.0/ApacheJMeter_core-3.0.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/home/ubuntu/.m2/repository/ch/qos/logback/logback-classic/1.1.7/logback-classic-1.1.7.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.\n\nIs it possible to address this issue in a 3.0.1 fix version? We are completely stuck upgrading jmeter for now. \n\nI would suggest to:\n- move the logkit StaticLoggerBinder into a separate jar,\n- add this separate log jar to jmeter's classpath,\n- remove any dependency to logkit / jorphan loggers in Apache JMeter code, and rely on SLF4J instead.\n\nThis would allow to completely control which logger is used by JMeter components and safely integrate jmeter's API into any existing java application.", "id": 191311, "time": "2016-05-30T07:25:46Z", "bug_id": 58794, "creation_time": "2016-05-30T07:25:46Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58794, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks for report.\nCan you open a dedicated bug for this with your previous content.\n\nContribution through patch is welcome.\nRegards", "id": 191322, "time": "2016-05-30T19:20:27Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-05-30T19:20:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58794, "text": "Closing this one as solved as Bug 59777 has been opened for the bug reported by Jerome Loisel", "id": 192754, "time": "2016-07-31T20:37:25Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-07-31T20:37:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
