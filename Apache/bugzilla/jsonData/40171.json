I have not tried 4.1.30.  \n\nI found that when I do a clean install of Tomcat 4.1.31 \nthe installer fails to do a couple of things that 4.1.29 \nused to do: \n\n1) There is no entry for Apache Tomcat in the Windows \n   Control Panel Add or Remove programs list.  \n\n2) There are several files missing from the conf directory \n   C:\\Program Files\\Apache Group\\Tomcat 4.1\\conf\\\n   In fact, the only file that does get installed there \n   is server.xml.  These five files are missing: \n\n   catalina.policy\n   jk2.properties\n   server-noexamples.xml.config\n   tomcat-users.xml\n   web.xml \n \nSince we are installing tomcat as one of several \n3rd party products in our own windows installer, \nwe install in silent mode: \njakarta-tomcat-4.1.31-LE-jdk14.exe /S /D=<our install dir>\n\nI tested by running the tomcat installer from a \nDOS prompt: \nd:\\tmp\\jakarta-tomcat-4.1.31-LE-jdk14.exe /S \n\nWhen I run with the /S option I have both problems. \nWhen I run the installer with no options, neither \nproblem occurs.  \n\nWhen I install tomcat 4.1.29 \nd:\\tmp\\jakarta-tomcat-4.1.29-LE-jdk14.exe /S \nneither problem occurs. \n\nI can copy the files over myself if I have to, but I \ndon't know how to work around the control panel \nadd/remove programs problem.  \n\nI have the Java 2 SDK 1.4.2_12 installed.  \nI am testing/developing on Windows XP SP2.  \n\nNote: I tested with 4.1.32 beta as well as 4.1.31.  \nThe results were the same.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 40171, "id": 91837, "time": "2006-08-02T19:13:16Z", "creator": "echawkes@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-08-02T19:13:16Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the report.
