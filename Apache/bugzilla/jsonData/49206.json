I have to use the batik-ext.jar because some of the classes in the library are used by some batik classes (like KeyboardEvent). Other classes of the batik-ext.jar are already part of the Java 6 Runtime (like EventTarget). \n\nSo on runtime, there are conflicts between dublicate classes.\n\nMy workaround: I opened the batik-ext.jar and deleted all duplicate files.\n\nIf you have a better solution to solve my problem, please say it to me.\n\nPS: It was not so easy to recognize that the reported exception was a result of the descripted problem. ;)"}]
