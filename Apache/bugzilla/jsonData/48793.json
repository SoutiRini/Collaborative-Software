OK, the process is dead ...\n    fi\n\nOn HP-UX (11.11 here), this does not work as expected, because kill (\"/usr/bin/kill\" actually, it's not shell a built-in) returns 2 when the PID doesn't exist, and not 1 as assumed above.\nIt would be better to rewrite these tests like this :\n\n   ...\n   if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then \n      ...\n\nA patch follows (made against 6.0.24)."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 48793, "text": "Thanks for the patch.
