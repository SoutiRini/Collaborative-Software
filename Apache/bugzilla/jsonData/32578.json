My application is written in C (embedded system) that was writing \ndebug information to stderr.\n\nLong story short, I observed repeatable behavior that after perhaps a few KB of information, my \napplication would hang.  Attaching with gdb indicated it was stuck down in libc, trying to write to \nstderr.\n\nAfter 300 seconds, my process would be killed.\n\nI can understand the desire to not allow CGI applications to fill error_log; so perhaps that is why \nhttpd stops servicing the stderr pipe.  Or perhaps that is the real bug.\n\nAssuming the former, It would have saved me a ton of energy if there had been a line in error_log \nindicating that the application had written too much data to stderr and would be killed.  It also \nseems that if the application is no longer going to be serviced, it should be killed right away.\n\nThanks for your time.\n-Mitch", "id": 68088, "time": "2004-12-08T06:17:53Z", "bug_id": 32578, "creation_time": "2004-12-08T06:17:53Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "is_private": false, "id": 68089, "time": "2004-12-08T07:00:11Z", "bug_id": 32578, "creation_time": "2004-12-08T07:00:11Z", "tags": [], "text": "This bug was fixed in 2.0.50.
