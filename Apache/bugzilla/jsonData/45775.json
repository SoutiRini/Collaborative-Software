Currently you can only do this using an external scheduler.\nIt seems like an easy enhancement to change the current behaviour of the scheduler to enable this.\nIf we could enter a regexp in the start time of the scheduler and set the cycle count to forever the problem would be solved - whenever the regexp matches true against the current time the test would run.\n\nThanks.\nSWK", "id": 120518, "time": "2008-09-10T07:58:55Z", "creator": "ralikwen@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-10T07:58:55Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45775, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Seems to me this is out of scope for JMeter.\n\nIt's also not easy to implement.\n\nSo won't fix, unless anyone provides a patch with test cases and documentation.", "id": 122262, "time": "2008-11-06T15:15:15Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-11-06T15:15:15Z", "is_private": false}]
