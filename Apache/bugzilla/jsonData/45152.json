FOP 0.93 was actually not compliant on this regard since it was (silently) switching to the separate border model.\n\nThe behaviours of FOP 0.94 and 0.95 are normal and to be expected with the collapsing model.

Web browsers seem to fill the corners while you can find both behaviours among XSL-FO implementations. I think most of the people who are using this model specify the same borders on all the cells of the table.

Thanks for the testcase, though.\n\nVincent\n"}, {"count": 11, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 155827, "time": "2012-04-01T06:43:31Z", "bug_id": 45152, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:43:31Z", "is_private": false}]
