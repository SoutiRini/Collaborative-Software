All the binaries are simply lumped into the \"bin\" directory.\n\n\nThis appears to be due to config.layout having the following:\n<Layout Apache>\n    prefix:        /usr/local/apache2\n    exec_prefix:   ${prefix}\n    bindir:        ${exec_prefix}/bin\n    sbindir:       ${exec_prefix}/bin\n\n\nIt is expected to see:\n    sbindir:       ${exec_prefix}/sbin\n\n\n\nIf this is the new default then the documentation should be updated.  If this is a mistake then the config.layout should be updated."}]
