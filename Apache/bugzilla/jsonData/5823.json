I believe the cause is that the \nStackFilterTest calls the static method BaseTestRunner.filterStack() which in \nturn calls BaseTestRunner.getPreference() which attempts to access a static \nProperties object.  However, the static Properties object is instantiated in a \n(non-static) instance initializer of BaseTestRunner.  This does not cause a \nproblem when accessed via JUnit's TestRunner because TestRunner extends \nBaseTestRunner, hence the initialization occurs.  However, Ant uses \nJUnitTestRunner to run the tests so the instance initialization of \nBaseTestRunner never takes place.\n\nAnyway, that is what I think is happening.  This caused me a lot of confusion \nwhen trying to get Ant and JUnit working together. I guess the proper fix would \nbe for the JUnit folks to instantiate the Properties object in a static \nintitialization block of BaseTestRunner. But most people will think the problem \nis with Ant, so I thought I would mention it here.\n\nMark Dematteis"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 10901, "time": "2002-02-19T16:24:15Z", "bug_id": 5823, "creation_time": "2002-02-19T16:24:15Z", "text": "I agree it is a problem with JUnit and not Ant.
