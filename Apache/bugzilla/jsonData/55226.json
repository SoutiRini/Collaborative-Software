[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55226, "text": "This is a request for new feature for mod_proxy/mod_proxy_balancer.\n\nCan you please take a look at providing the capability for mod_proxy_balancer to identify which (group of) nodes to failover to. As an example, if cluster A has node 1 and 2 replicated together, and cluster B has nodes 3 and 4.\nIf node 1 fails it has to failover to only node 2 since the session objects are replicated on that node.  Accordingly, node 3 will have node 4 as failover. If however, node 1 and 2 are both down, then failover to either node 3 or 4. This is similar to the \"domain cluster\" capability in mod_jk.\n\nThis is to address the requirement of deploying several smaller cluster groups rather than one large cluster for performance considerations.   \n\nWill also appreciate if it can be back-ported to version 2.2.x\n\nThanks.", "id": 168436, "time": "2013-07-09T21:59:34Z", "creator": "samsonb2003@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2013-07-09T21:59:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55226, "text": "Categorizing as an enhancement.", "id": 168437, "time": "2013-07-09T22:07:58Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-07-09T22:07:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
