[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "To my understanding, any JAR file placed in common/lib becomes global and all\nwebapps automatically see them in their classpath. As well, it seems that a\nwebapp's configuration file (conf/.../*.xml) requires a specific JAR in its\nclasspath -- such as a DB driver -- then it must be located in the global JAR\nrepository as well.\n\nI am asking that we differentiate between JARs referred to by configuration\nfiles and those that are *meant* to be global across all webapps. The problem is\nthat all too often we are forced to place JAR files in common/lib because our\nconfiguration files refer to them but then this causes conflicts between\napplications. One application might require one version of the JAR while another\nmight require another -- or some application shouldn't see a certain JAR at all\non its classpath because then it might decide to use it when we don't want it to.\n\nAnyway, I think you get my point. Is there a trivial workaround for this\nproblem? If not, any idea on how to solve it?\n\nThank you,\nGili", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 34614, "id": 74110, "time": "2005-04-26T08:14:12Z", "creator": "cowwoc@bbs.darktech.org", "creation_time": "2005-04-26T08:14:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I don't get your point, I don't agree with the \"it seems\" part, and I don't see\na trivial solution to what I think might be your point.
