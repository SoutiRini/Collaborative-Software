The web.xml in\nthe conf directory still includes the default welcome files and the web.xml in\nroot does not include a welcome-file definition so this should be working. I am\nsomewhat suspicious this is a JDK bug as JDK 1.4.1_02 is currently in beta under\nOS/2 but I need your help to track down the problem. When someone hits the root\ndirectory, what command to you execute to check to see whether or not the\nwelcome-files should be used? Perhaps there is a bug in the URL implementation.\nPlease help me track down the problem and create a testcase for our JDK 1.4.1 team.\n\nThanks,\nGili", "id": 34235, "time": "2003-04-01T13:12:05Z", "creator": "cowwoc@bbs.darktech.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-01T13:12:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18562, "attachment_id": null, "id": 34310, "time": "2003-04-02T09:30:26Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-02T09:30:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Look at the code (package is org.apache.catalina.naming.resources).\nI obviously cannot reproduce this (the default page is served like that, and it\nworks fine)."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18562, "attachment_id": null, "id": 34328, "time": "2003-04-02T13:07:17Z", "creator": "cowwoc@bbs.darktech.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-02T13:07:17Z", "is_private": false, "text": "But where in the code does it say: \"if a directory is hit, try redirecting to\nwelcome-files instead\"?"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 34348, "time": "2003-04-02T15:22:56Z", "bug_id": 18562, "creation_time": "2003-04-02T15:22:56Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla is not meant to discuss implementation details, or for providing user\nor developer support.
