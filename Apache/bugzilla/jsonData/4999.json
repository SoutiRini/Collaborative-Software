These work fine in standalone Batik.\n\n(I have to use SVG fonts because Batik doesn't look at the\nsame font database as FOP, and I've never managed to get TTF fonts\nworking with Batik satisfactorily).\nI'm guessing that this is because FOP's instream-foreign-object doesn't\nsimply pass the DOM subtree to Batik, but instead for some reason\nparses the subtree itself then reconstructs it for Batik.  I have no idea\nwhy.\ncheers,\n-- Jamie"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4999, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 18717, "time": "2002-06-28T14:14:26Z", "creator": "keiron@aftexsw.com", "creation_time": "2002-06-28T14:14:26Z", "text": "This issue has been fixed in the redesigned code."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4999, "attachment_id": null, "id": 156154, "time": "2012-04-01T07:01:21Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:01:21Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed"}]
