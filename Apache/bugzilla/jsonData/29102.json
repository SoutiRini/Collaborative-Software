Still same problem.\nSo, I thought something may have stopped working right. I uninstalled 2049 and\ninstalled 2048 and it works fine. Did not freeze. Something isn't right with the\n2049 server. I did one more cycle of trying to installed 2049 and then 2048\nagain, finding again that 2048 works fine, but 2049 freezes. \n\nI wanted to get the newest version to get to bugfixes and security holes fixed,\nhowever, the version doesn't work, so I cannot.
