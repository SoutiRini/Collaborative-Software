[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49064, "text": "The OpenLDAP SDK when compiled against the Cyrus SASL library permits SASL binding to the server.  This is particularly helpful when SASL EXTERNAL authentication is used to authenticate the client based upon the client's certificate presented when setting up the TLS session.\n\nIf implemented, customers with a compatible client and server could remove the hard-coded, plain-text AuthLDAPBindPassword variable from their Apache httpd server configuration files.  httpd's mod_ldap.so is dependent upon APR-util's ldap capabilities.  I'd like to be able to specify \"AuthLDAPBindSASL on\" [potentially with other SASL options supporting any mechanisms other than EXTERNAL in common use]\n\n[An example of support for SASL binding is demonstrated in the OpenLDAP SDK's tools/common.c file].", "id": 135942, "time": "2010-04-07T19:23:38Z", "creator": "peter.thomas@readi-systems.com", "creation_time": "2010-04-07T19:23:38Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
