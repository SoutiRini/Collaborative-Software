I am using afp extension elements <afp:no-operation> to insert information with each logical page in the output. The current implementation inserts the NOP within/inside the logical page, but my requirement is to put the NOP above/before the logical page in AFP output. This seems to be a valid requirement as per MO: DCA format but I could not find any way to configure this in current FOP 1.0 version.\n\nMy request is to provide an attribute or configuration parameter to define the position of NOP in afp output. I have attached an image file for reference.\n\nIs it possible to get this feature added/fixed and delivered as a patch if this is a simple change? I am currently stuck with this and need to figure out my options.\n\nAppreciate your help.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nSandeep"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sdhulia@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 26603\nNop position in output\n\nThe attached image shows current output and expected output.", "id": 143975, "time": "2011-02-04T04:46:55Z", "bug_id": 50719, "creation_time": "2011-02-04T04:46:55Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 26603}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "id": 157377, "time": "2012-04-07T01:42:05Z", "bug_id": 50719, "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:42:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50719, "is_private": false, "id": 157660, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-08T04:55:35Z", "time": "2012-04-08T04:55:35Z", "text": "please provide minimal input FO file containing an example of requested feature"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "(In reply to comment #3)\n> please provide minimal input FO file containing an example of requested feature\n\nSandeep, I am still awaiting your input as requested above. if I see no further input by April 30, I will close this bug due to lack of requested information.
