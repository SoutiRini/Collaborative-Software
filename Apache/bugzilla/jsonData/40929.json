I ended up\nhaving to install SVN and do a svn log to figure out why the code was removed.\n\nWhen the code was stripped down, the comments in the java file (and therefore in\nthe javadoc api) remained identical, so the javadoc api for the class is very\nmisleading.  For instance, the comments say that the class implements Reloader,\nwhen it in fact does not.\n\nThe class comments should be updated to reflect the state of the code.\n\nI can't see this as being very high priority, but it would likely be an easy to\nfix for people whom are in the code regularly, and it would make the javadoc\nmuch more readable for people that extend the StandardClassLoader for their own\npurposes."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 95672, "time": "2006-11-10T13:07:34Z", "bug_id": 40929, "creation_time": "2006-11-10T13:07:34Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This has been fixed in SVN and will be in 5.5.21 onwards."}]
