Any startup delay of the tomcat server should be\npassed on as a delay of the requested servlet response.\n\n\nActual behavior:\n\nDuring tomcat startup, before the startup is completely finished, httpd\nimmediately returns a server error 500 as response to a servlet request.\n\nWe find it difficult to accept that users get server errors because a server is\nre-started.\n\nIn this context it is very unfortunate that the user impact increases with every\nvirtual server we add, due to two reasons:\n\na) Higher number of users using this httpd instance.\nb) Higher proportion of users affected due to longer server startup delay for\nevery additional virtual host.\n\nNot sure whether this issue is resolvable on the tomcat side or mod_jk side.", "count": 0, "id": 72549, "time": "2005-03-17T06:30:59Z", "bug_id": 34050, "creation_time": "2005-03-17T06:30:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "text": "If you want QoS, do not run with a single node.
