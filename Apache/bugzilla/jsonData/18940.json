My proposal is \nsimple: Allow for inserting any attribute in a <antcall> element and make these \nattributes available as parameters inside the target ant task. Example:\nCurrent:\n    <antcall target=\"ftp.get.lib\">\n      <param name=\"src\" value=\"${cvs.export}/junit/junit-3_8_1\"/>\n      <param name=\"file\" value=\"junit.jar\"/>\n    </antcall>\nAfter:\n    <antcall target=\"ftp.get.lib\"\n                src=\"${cvs.export}/junit/junit-3_8_1\"\n               file=\"junit.jar\"/>\n    </antcall>\n\nOf course common attribute analyse comes first, i.e. \"target\" is an attribute \nconsumed by the <antcall> task itself - but name clashes of this kind should \nnot be an issue.\n\nAlthough this is only a slight change - it would make my build files more \nreadable and clear.", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "stevel@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 34999, "time": "2003-04-11T16:20:40Z", "bug_id": 18940, "creation_time": "2003-04-11T16:20:40Z", "is_private": false, "text": "1. Its not a slight change, its a major change in how ant binds XML file to java\nsource. Try it yourself to see. \n\n2. if we did it, we'd be permanently boxed out from ever adding new attributes\nto <antcall>, which is something we do. \n\n3. the advantage of <param> is it lets you provide extra qualifiers such as\n<param name=\"foo\" location=\"somewhere\">; there are differences between value and\nlocation, and perhaps you should look at the docs and see where they are applicable.\n\nSorry,\n"}]
