[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Our team is using Tomcat 5.0.18 (running on AIX 5.1) as an input file receiver. \nThe input file size from 1 KB to 500 KB and there is no LF or CR in the middle \nof file, in another word, the whole file came in as one big line.\nAt first, we were using BufferedReader.readline() and Tomcat thrown IOException \nfor some files. Then we tried using BufferedReader.read(char []) to receive \ndata from the input file and put the data into a StringBuffer:\n===========================================================\nBufferedReader meoBody = httpServletRequest.getReader();\nwhile ((bytesRead=meoBody.read(meoContentChars)) != -1){\n   totalBytes+=bytesRead;\n   meoContentBuffer.append(meoContentChars,0,bytesRead);\n}\n\nwhere \n   meoBody = httpServletRequest.getReader();\n   meoContentBuffer=new StringBuffer(incomingFileContentLength);\n   meoContentChars=new char[512];\n===========================================================\nWe are reading 512 bytes at a time, most time we got the whole file fine, but \nsome time we ONLY got partial data from the incoming file. The missed data \nportion is always somewhere in the middle of file. The less network traffic is, \nthe more chance that we could receive the whole file. \nWe are just wondering whether this happenned to other Tomcat 5 users before or \nnot. I'm really appreciate if you could provide some advices on this issue.\n\nThanks,\nYongan", "is_private": false, "id": 55602, "creator": "wang@qualexphoto.com", "time": "2004-04-10T04:40:53Z", "bug_id": 28325, "creation_time": "2004-04-10T04:40:53Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "A related bug has been fixed (bug 27447).
