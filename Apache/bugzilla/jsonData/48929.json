Issue is happening when the\ndownload is streaming from the webserver to application server via\nweblogic plugin ( did not test other streaming application) in test we\ndownload 1.14 GB files. using \"orbit\" download client we do not see\nthe problem, but Orbit creates 8 concurrent request and splits the download in small pieces. Modzilla, created just a single request and immediately the http thread utilization goes to 100%.\n\nCan any one please help?\n\nRegards,\n\nMatty"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48929, "attachment_id": null, "id": 135399, "time": "2010-03-17T15:42:07Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-03-17T15:42:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "if downloading from Apache HTTP Server directly works, and you only have a problem when you use a vendors module, you need to report the symptom to the vendor."}]
