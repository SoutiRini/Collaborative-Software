Currently, we patch our mime.types file at build time \nto add this directive, but it would be great if this could flow upstream.\n\nThis will effect all quicktime capable clients connecting to apache servers, as it will allow them to \nopen quicktime links directly in quicktime player as opposed to just getting garbled text as they \nwould now.
