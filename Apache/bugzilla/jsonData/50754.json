[{"text": "The shutdown.sh script is not at times removing the catalina.pid file so when startup.sh runs it fails since there's an old catalina.pid file that still exists.\n\nIn addition, the -force does not work at times which probably is the reason for the above.\n\nWe are forced to put wrapper script in place to do an lsof to kill the process if it's found. Our Build Framework for our products will be delivered to our customers after this year and we will not be providing our wrapper script to them so we hope that this gets fixed by then.\n\nThanks.
