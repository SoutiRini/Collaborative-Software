Most of these DoS-prevention strategies are much better implemented either\nat the router or at the OS level.  Although certainly there is more that\ncould be done at the Apache level too.\n\n2. This bug report is way too broad.  Since there is no way that we could ever say\nthat this bug is \"fixed\", it will just hang around forever.\n\nBecause of reason 2, I'm going to close this report.   That doesn't mean the\nissue isn't important.  If you would like to help more, I suggest one of the\nfollowing:\n\na) Get involved with the dev@httpd.apache.org mailing list.\n\nb) File more specific bug reports.\n\nThanks for using Apache!", "id": 27068, "time": "2002-11-27T16:24:35Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-11-27T16:24:35Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
