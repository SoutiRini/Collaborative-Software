It is intended for use in a reverse\nproxy environment where it is not desirable to allow authentication with the\norigin server.\n\nPossibly the directive should also scrub Authorization: headers from the\nrequest, as it is hard to imagine a use case where this is not desirable.\nHowever, that can easily be done with mod_headers."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rici@ricilake.net", "attachment_id": 14666, "id": 73458, "time": "2005-04-08T20:45:52Z", "bug_id": 34377, "creation_time": "2005-04-08T20:45:52Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 14666\nPatch for mod_proxy.c to implement ProxyAuthOverride"}]
