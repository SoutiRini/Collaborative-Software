It appears that either the server (in this Apache) is unescaping the URL to just put it as % and then when it hits Tomcat it then barfs because it doesn't understand the plain %. I have compared the configuration on both tomcat3.2.3 and 3.2.2 and they are the same so I can only believe it is a problem with Tomcat.I know the message is coming from Tomcat because I get a message in the tomcat.log.Please help,Gary"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3653, "text": "This behavior is by design due to security issues.
