This is\ndocumented in the Debian BTS (http://bugs.debian.org) as bug #323785\n(http://bugs.debian.org/323785).\n\nThe issue was discussed in the #apache channel on IRC, and it was concluded that\nthe reason for the segfault is that cgid is unable to access the memory region\nwhere mod_vhost_ldap keeps its module_config structure -- or any other\nmodule_config structure for that matter. For suExec, there is special magic in\nmod_cgid that allows its configuration to be passed through the unix socket so\nthat cgid can use it. However, adding such special cases for every module that\nneeds them is not really a good way to solve the problem.\n\nSo a more generic way of letting mod_cgid access is needed.
