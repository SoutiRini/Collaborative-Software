Thanks, Peter, for the contribution. Here are some \ncomments:\n\n1. I'm not going to pretend to understand all of what is going on in the code, \nbut the testing I did, and the limited code review I did generally looked good.\n\n2. There were quite a few style issues in the submitted code. This is \nunderstandable, as I assume that you were trying to take preexisting code and \nsubmit it intact, so I checked it in that way (mostly), then made an additional \ncommit to fix the easy style changes. In case you are not familiar with the FOP \nstyle requirements, please see:\n    http://xml.apache.org/fop/dev/conventions.html\nThe unresolved style issues mostly are variable names and javadoc comments that \nare missing or incomplete. Please address these at your earliest convenience. \n(The remainder of FOP code still has quite a few such things to do as well).\n\n3. It took me quite a while to apply the patch because there was an intervening \npatch. Patching patches confuses the automated patch command. We will probably \nactually make faster progress if you wait to submit the subsequent patch until \nafter the earlier patch is applied. I know this isn't always practical, but I \nthought it worth mentioning.\n\n4. It looks like a change that I made to background color has disappeared. I \nthink I had reset that and other attributes automatically at the beginning of a \nparagraph. IIRC, RTF treats these things sequentially, i.e. if changed, the \nchange remains effective until changed again. FO tends to work more on chunks \n(blocks, inlines), having attributes, and assuming that each chunk is reset to \nsome default value (e.g. white background, parent value, etc.) when the chunk \nis completed. If you want to see an example, run examples/fo/basic/normal.fo, \nwhere the title should have a background color of blue, but in fact, all \nsubsequent text does as well.\n\nThanks for all of your efforts here. Please let us know if there are things we \ncan do to help."}, {"count": 10, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 23166, "is_private": false, "id": 155587, "time": "2012-04-01T06:29:22Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:29:22Z", "tags": [], "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed"}]
