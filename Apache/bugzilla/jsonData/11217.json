[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "beau@bestnetpc.com", "text": "I am attempting to integrate TagLibs for use with Dreamweaver via the tutorial \nat jakarta.apache.org/taglibs. I am running Win2k with tomcat 4.0.4. I have \nmade the necessary installations, but when I try to use a custom tag from \nwithin Dreamweaver, I run into a problem. The extension is able to successfully \ncommunicate with Tomcat so that I may 'Select a Custom Tag Library', but I am \nnot able to actually 'Select a Tag to Insert'. When I attempt this, I receive \nthe following alert 'Tag library \"struts-logic\" not found on server'. I have \nalready edited the useTagLibs.js to listen on the proper port, and am able to \nuse the Live Data mode successfully in Dreamweaver. I have tested this with \nboth Dreamweaver MX and Dreamweaver Ultradev,  and receiving the same error \nmessage for each. I have searched the mailing archives extensively and have not \ncome across this issue. I did manage to contact another fellow that posted a \nthread a while back with the same problem. No one ever contact him about any \npotential solutions, and he is still unable to use the extension due to the \nsame error message that i received. I apologize if this error message is due to \nany omsission on my part, but thought that I would post this as I have not \nfound any mention of this problem anywhere.
