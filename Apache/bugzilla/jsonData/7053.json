The issue is that the first implies that the returned\nnumber is 'pixels per millimeter' when in fact the number returned is\n'millimeters per pixel'.", "id": 11697, "time": "2002-03-12T16:14:46Z", "creator": "vincent.hardy@sun.com", "creation_time": "2002-03-12T16:14:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
