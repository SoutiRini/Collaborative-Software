A table-cell has to grow in block-\nprogression-dimension (i.e. vertical normally) until the content fits into the \ncell despite the height property. The height property in this case only \ndefines a minimum.\n\nPlease see http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/slice7.html#height and \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/tables.html\n\n> 2.If i use a block-container then the image in that cell is not displayed.\n> i actually have to fix the position of  an image with respect to top or \nbottom \n> of page. i am using xsl 1.1 version\n\nMore interesting would be what FOP version you use. Can you supply a simple \n(!) FO file that shows what you tried to do? You can save us a lot of time \nthat way. Thanks.\n\n"}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 36120, "is_private": false, "id": 78532, "time": "2005-08-16T10:12:10Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-08-16T10:12:10Z", "tags": [], "text": "Closing this issue.
