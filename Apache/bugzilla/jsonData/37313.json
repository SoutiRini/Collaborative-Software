A function with the same name is used in each of 'em but the code in \neach function is different. Unfortunately, when the first jar is loaded, the \ncode of the function seems to be kept in memory and when I call the same \nfunction in the 2nd jar, it uses the one of the first jar. Is there a way to \nfix this?\nthanks\nSimon-Pierre"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37313, "text": "You can only have one version of a class per classloader repository.
