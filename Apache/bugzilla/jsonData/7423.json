This is correct based on the spec, however,\nthe problem lies in LocaleSupport.parseLocale(String, String) - line 170.  If a\nnull value was returned, as it would be of javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.locale was\nnot set, parseLocale(String, String) will return the default locale of the\nsystem where the container runs, and thus return a value when none should be\nreturned (See line 221 of BundleSupport).  Based on the spec (Section 8.3.2,\npage 8-73), I would think that consideration of the containers default locale\nwould be illegal.\n\nI changed the null check in LocalSupport.parseLocale(String, String) to return\nnull instead of the default locale (see diff below) and the algorithm began to\nwork as expected.  I haven't spent the time to see if the diff below has any\nside effects, but I believe this is enough information to correct the issue.\n\n*****************************************************************\nIndex: LocaleSupport.java\n===================================================================\nRCS file:\n/home/cvs/jakarta-taglibs/standard/src/org/apache/taglibs/standard/tag/common/fmt/LocaleSupport.java,v\nretrieving revision 1.14\ndiff -u -r1.14 LocaleSupport.java\n--- LocaleSupport.java\t23 Mar 2002 01:33:50 -0000\t1.14\n+++ LocaleSupport.java\t25 Mar 2002 03:55:29 -0000\n@@ -175,7 +175,8 @@\n \tint index = -1;\n \n \tif ((locale == null) || locale.equals(\"\")) {\n-\n    return Locale.getDefault();\n+\n    //return Locale.getDefault();\n+        return null;\n \t}\n \n \tif (((index = locale.indexOf(HYPHEN)) > -1)\n*************************************************************"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "Ryan.Lubke@Sun.COM", "text": "*** Bug 7424 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 12264, "time": "2002-03-25T04:11:56Z", "bug_id": 7423, "creation_time": "2002-03-25T04:11:56Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "Ryan.Lubke@Sun.COM", "text": "*** Bug 7425 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 12266, "time": "2002-03-25T04:12:24Z", "bug_id": 7423, "creation_time": "2002-03-25T04:12:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7423, "attachment_id": null, "text": "*** Bug 7426 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 12268, "time": "2002-03-25T04:12:46Z", "creator": "Ryan.Lubke@Sun.COM", "creation_time": "2002-03-25T04:12:46Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7423, "text": "Going back over the spec, I see why the containers default locale is used,\nhowever, there is still the issue of this providing the default locale when it\nshouldn't be.\n\n", "id": 12297, "time": "2002-03-25T15:25:43Z", "creator": "Ryan.Lubke@Sun.COM", "creation_time": "2002-03-25T15:25:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": 1421, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7423, "text": "Created attachment 1421\nA more complete patch that handles the value attribute of fmt:locale being null or empty and allows the ResourceBundle lookup algorithm to work as spec'd.", "count": 5, "id": 12310, "time": "2002-03-25T18:10:15Z", "creator": "Ryan.Lubke@Sun.COM", "creation_time": "2002-03-25T18:10:15Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "Ryan.Lubke@Sun.COM", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 1429\nUpdated patches", "id": 12364, "time": "2002-03-26T22:20:01Z", "bug_id": 7423, "creation_time": "2002-03-26T22:20:01Z", "attachment_id": 1429}]
