This is because the \"/incremental\" flag is now obsolete.\n\n\nForgive me for not including a patch, as I don't now the proper format.  My idea for a fix:\n\nModify CSharp.getIncrementalParameter() to return nothing, unless a supporting framework is being used.\n\nTo figure out whether a supporting framework is being used, I'd personally just add a \"FrameworkVersion\" property to the task.
