Cache-Control directives.\n\nI wrote a little patch for the ap_proxy_liststr function in proxy_util.c, can\nyou tell me if it is correct ?\n\nThe problem is that this function doesn't correctly handle the = sign, so val\nisn't correctly set. I also added a memset(valbuf, 0, sizeof(valbuf)) because\nthis variable wasn't clean when I copied it in *val...\n\nThanks for looking at it and tell me if it's not \"dangerous\" for my apache build !\n\nThomas.", "id": 30166, "time": "2003-01-28T14:44:01Z", "creator": "tcastelle@generali.fr", "creation_time": "2003-01-28T14:44:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 4584\nPatch to correctly handle Cache-Control directives with = signs", "attachment_id": 4584, "id": 30167, "creator": "tcastelle@generali.fr", "time": "2003-01-28T14:44:55Z", "bug_id": 16492, "creation_time": "2003-01-28T14:44:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "tcastelle@generali.fr", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Is someone looking at this bug ?\nPlease keep me informed !\n\nThomas.", "id": 30431, "time": "2003-01-31T16:23:23Z", "bug_id": 16492, "creation_time": "2003-01-31T16:23:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16492, "attachment_id": null, "id": 30990, "time": "2003-02-10T10:06:40Z", "creator": "tcastelle@generali.fr", "creation_time": "2003-02-10T10:06:40Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I'm very sad, nobody's looking at my bugs !
