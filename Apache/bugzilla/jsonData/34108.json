It is the mtime of the DocumentRoot. But only\nif the mtime of DocumentRoot is _newer_ than the date you want to\nset.\n\nThere's no \"Last-Modified\" in the response header when you don't set\nit yourself.\n\nap_update_mtime() only updates r->mtime when the supplied time is\n_newer_. So I've guessed that some other handler sets r->mtime to\nthe DocumentRoot.\n\nI've found mod_negotiation.
