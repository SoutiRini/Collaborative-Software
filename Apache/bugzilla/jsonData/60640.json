The installation of this version 2.4.25 got completed about a week back and since then it is running without issues. However, on an avearge about 10 times daily, we can see the below message in our virtual host error_log.\n\nWed Jan 25 09:34:54.874498 2017] [proxy_connect:notice] [pid 15645:tid 20] [client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx] AH01026: err on backconn\n\nBy looking at some related threads, it seemed that a similar issue was resolved in version 2.4.11, so we being a higher version would have expected not to have encountered this. Can you provide any suggestions/workarounds for this?\n\nThanks in advance.", "id": 196390, "time": "2017-01-25T09:55:43Z", "creator": "soumik.mukherjee@dsm.com", "creation_time": "2017-01-25T09:55:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "ylavic.dev@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 196392, "time": "2017-01-25T11:54:58Z", "bug_id": 60640, "creation_time": "2017-01-25T11:54:58Z", "text": "mod_proxy_connect detects a condition where the backend resets the connection which is then considered incomplete (as opposed to a clean close which usually marks the \"normal\" end of stream), hence the error message.\n\nThis is likely not a bug in Apache httpd (unless more details like related network traces contradict the above), but probably more a network/backend issue which could better be discussed on the users@ mailing list [1].\n\nClosing this report for now, but feel free to reopen with more details (i.e. some evidence of a bug).\n\n[1] users@httpd.apache.org"}]
