Why\n> is it not using the JAXP APIs?\n\nAs far as I know (please correct me if I'm wrong), this is due to the fact that Batik targeted Java 1.3 as of Batik release version 1.7. Currently, Java 1.4 is the target for the trunk version [3].\n\nApparently, Java 1.3 didn't contain the JAXP features and Java 1.4 had them with few bugs [4] so I'd say that, until Batik targets Java 1.5, this may be a requirement...\n\n\n\n(In reply to comment #1)\n> I am having a problem with Batik in Tomcat on Windows XP and CentOS, but not in\n> Jetty, or Tomcat on Mac.\n> Any insight?  Is this a bug?\n\n(Read above first.)\n\nI'd say that this is just a coincidence. Probably, in the environments that work as expected, either:\n * Are using Java 1.4 (which apparently uses the same namespaces for the embedded JAXP functionality [4] as crimson);\n * Crimson is available in the default classpath.\n\n\n\n@Matt Fisher\nThe \"need info\" status for bug reports is more targeted at when more information is required from the reporter [5], which doesn't seem to be the case here (I understand the underlying idea, though). ;-)\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n Helder Magalh\u00e3es\n\n\n\n[1] http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/mailing-lists.html\n[2] http://www.nabble.com/Batik-f308.html\n[3] http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/download.cgi#Subversion+repository\n[4] http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/xml/jaxp/JAXP-Compatibility_150.html#packageNamesWhy\n[5] https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/page.cgi?id=fields.html#status", "is_private": false, "id": 125979, "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "time": "2009-04-03T09:09:50Z", "bug_id": 45779, "creation_time": "2009-04-03T09:09:50Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45779, "attachment_id": null, "id": 125984, "time": "2009-04-03T11:13:49Z", "creator": "mafisher2@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-04-03T11:13:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for your response and references.
