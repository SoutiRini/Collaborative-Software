To get around this the code has to 'jump through hoops'. In this case \nthe Knuth sequences returned by getNextKnuthElement are used to reverse \nengineer words which extend over an inline boundary. This in turn needs to be \ndone to determine if an additional letter space needs to be added as the \nindividual LMs don't do that at a boundary because they don't know if they \nstart/end at the beginning/end of a word or in the middle of a word.\n\nOf course this \"ranting\" about the problem will not get us a solution. In the \nvery short term may be Luca can have a look at this as he as fixed a similar \nproblem before in a related area.\n\nAfter that we really need to redesign the line breaking stuff. Not the Knuth \napproach (and the implemented algorithms related to that) but the way we arrive \nat the Knuth sequences and iterate and process the text elements.
