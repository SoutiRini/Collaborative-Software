This is a result of using a dynamically allocated data structure(line ~1260) whose allocation(line 1559) is not checked. The size of this data structure is linearly dependent of the -n value. This may be a design bug in itself since it prevents ab runs with a potentially infinite number of requests, e.g. to test how many requests can be served in 42 seconds. The attached patch makes ab exit properly when the memory allocation fails."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "fixed in trunk in r826497", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 47178, "id": 131203, "time": "2009-10-18T12:03:03Z", "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "creation_time": "2009-10-18T12:03:03Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47178, "is_private": false, "text": "not yet fixed in 2.2.x", "id": 136498, "time": "2010-04-28T15:35:17Z", "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "creation_time": "2010-04-28T15:35:17Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 49215 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 47178, "id": 136500, "time": "2010-04-28T15:37:26Z", "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "creation_time": "2010-04-28T15:37:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "attachment_id": null, "id": 154215, "time": "2012-02-26T16:55:27Z", "bug_id": 47178, "creation_time": "2012-02-26T16:55:27Z", "is_private": false, "text": "fixed in 2.4.1"}]
