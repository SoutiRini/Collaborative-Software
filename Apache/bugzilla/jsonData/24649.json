The \nservlet engine is also running on LP18UT3.  The GTest class uses \nsocket.getLocalAddress().getHostName();  to retrieve the name of the machine \nand adds it as a request parameter having value \"LP18UT3\".  When the request is \nsubmitted, GetRemoteHostTestServlet calls getHostName(), which \nreturns \"LP18UT3\".  The servlet also grabs the reqest parameter which is \nstill \"LP18UT3\".  However, before comparing the two values, the servlet does a \ntoLowerCase() on the value returned from getHostName(), effectively \nchanging \"LP18UT3\" to \"lp18ut3\".  The servlet then does a case sensitive \ncompare (via String.indexOf()) between lp18ut3 and LP18UT3, which fails to \nmatch, and hence fails the test.\n\nThe test should not be case-sensitive.  It assumes that getHostName() returns \nthe lower case form of the machine name, regardless of what is the actual case \nof the machine name.  The test should be changed to account for this fact, \nperhaps by doing a toLowerCase() on both strings before performing the \nString.indexOf(String), or performing no toLowerCase() at all."}]
