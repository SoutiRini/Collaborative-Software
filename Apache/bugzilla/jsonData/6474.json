This may\n  be so either because the metrics file generator is broken or because\n  of a bug in FOP - I did not check this).\n- The PDF renderer DOES handle non-integral font sizes correctly. Because\n  the renderer partially performs his own calculations, the result\n  will - depending on the circumstances - either look good (but measure wrong)\n  or totally broken. One effect that can happen is described in #6458.\n- I rated this bug as major, because this bug can be very difficult\n  to diagnose for uses - lots of wasted time.\nThe current workaround is not to use non-integral font sizes.\n\n- As a consequence, at least FOP should round font sizes in formatting\n  objects down to the next lower integral point size.", "id": 10724, "time": "2002-02-14T21:37:25Z", "creator": "arnd.beissner@t-online.de", "creation_time": "2002-02-14T21:37:25Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "arnd.beissner@t-online.de", "is_private": false, "id": 10728, "time": "2002-02-14T21:41:07Z", "bug_id": 6474, "creation_time": "2002-02-14T21:41:07Z", "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 6458 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6474, "text": "Seems to be fixed in 0.20.4.
