I've recently worked on that to make it at least a bit more usable (and currently I'm too lazy to update the Forge / Wiki pages):\nhttp://www.gknw.net/development/gcc_nlm/\nbut what's still missing is a cross compiler based on gcc 4.1.2 or later which understands -fpack-struct=4 in order to set the alignment of 4 which is what Apache 2.x is currently compiled with; unless to have that same alignment your resulting build will be incompatible with all Novell-provided modules, and thus not widely usable.\n\n> Similarly, cross-compiling has been available for quite some time (since NetWare\n> v5.1, about 4 years ago), as this link from March 2003 shows -->\n> http://www.herdsoft.com/ti/netware/cross/3_Using_Netware_cross_compi.html\nthis is based on the same cross-gcc as the above link, therefore same limitations apply.\n\n> The existing docs really only apply to NetWare v6.0, and then only if you ignore\n> cross-compilation. The existing docs definitely do *not* apply to *modern* NetWare.\nNo. We still compile with CodeWarrior, and unless someone (you?) provides:\n1) a new cross compiler for Linux and Win32 based on gcc 4.1.2 or later\n2) information / patches to configure to make cross-compile really work\nthe docu remains as is.\nI'm though _very_ open to work with someone familar with building cross compilers to to solve point 1 - just contact me directly since this is not Apache-related.\nI'm closing the bug now - if you feel that still something should be changed then feel free to re-open, and provide exact information on how you cross-compile for NetWare plattform.\n\nG\u00fcnter.\n"}]
