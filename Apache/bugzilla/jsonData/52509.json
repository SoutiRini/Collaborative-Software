For example, for 300 images, i will get about 7 requests.  There will be sometimes a log line or two that the password is incorrect even though it is 100% typed in the same repeatedly for the multiple requests.\n\n- If I switch from .htaccess to using a <directory> command, the repeated credential disappears.\n\nThis is using http 2.2.21 and was discussed on the mailing list.\n\nWhile I expect the .htaccess to be more resource intensive, the fact that it breaks operation with a browser as ubiquitous as IE 6,7,8 & 9 leads me to believe this is a bug.\n\nI have repeated this testing on multiple servers with multiple httpd versions including 1.3 branches.\n\nI can provide much more information as this has been discussed on the mailing list but I think the core information above is the most helpful.\n\nregards,\nKAM", "id": 153070, "time": "2012-01-23T18:32:38Z", "bug_id": 52509, "creation_time": "2012-01-23T18:32:38Z", "is_private": false}]
