All that is \nrequired is to have an hashtable in the engine where variables are taken from.  \nThis would add a lot of functionality to ORO Perl.\n\nFurthermore along those lines, you could integrate ORO's Perl engine withe the \nJakarta's XPath engine.  This would be optional of course.\n\nThere are many REGEX engines out there so ORO needs to demark itself from the \nothers by providing special features.\n\nColbert Philippe"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20759, "attachment_id": null, "id": 38813, "time": "2003-06-13T18:46:45Z", "creator": "dfs@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-06-13T18:46:45Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This functionality is already provided in a more efficient and clear manner\nby allowing you to implement the Substitution interface.
