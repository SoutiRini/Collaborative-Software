The reason for the corrupted project file errors is that the development environment is dumb enough to only look for Windows style line endings (CRLF) instead of checking for Unix ones (LF). All you need to do is open all .dsw and .dsp files (search for them recursively) in Wordpad, for example, type in a space, delete the space (to cause the editor to mark the file as modified), and save the file overwriting the old one. That will cause the line endings to be converted to Windows format, and the IDE will read and convert them just fine.\nThis is the case only in the distribution tarballs, which are built on a Unix machine. The SVN checkouts work fine since Subversion translates line endings to native format on any checkout.\n\nAs to the msdev issue, just replace msdev.exe with devenv.exe and you'll be fine.", "is_private": false}]
