This patch adds a COMMENT directive:\n\n<!--#comment text=\"here comes some marketing lingo\"-->\n\nI am sure these changes will be useful to others.\n-dave", "id": 73452, "time": "2005-04-08T18:18:25Z", "bug_id": 34375, "creation_time": "2005-04-08T18:18:25Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34375, "attachment_id": 14665, "text": "Created attachment 14665\n diff -u mod_include.c-old  mod_include.c", "id": 73453, "time": "2005-04-08T18:20:26Z", "creator": "dmckellar@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-04-08T18:20:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Do NOT change bug ownership.", "id": 82229, "time": "2005-11-08T18:12:11Z", "bug_id": 34375, "creation_time": "2005-11-08T18:12:11Z", "attachment_id": null}]
