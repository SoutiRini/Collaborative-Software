This is forcing me to restart my server even though STS agent reloading successfully reloaded the class.  It would be nice if Tomcat supported the ability to turn off the EL Reflection cache.  I noticed the org.apache.el.BeanELResolver.CACHE_SIZE but setting this value to 0 still caches results in a WeakHashMap.\n\nIt would be nice if it were possible to completely disable this cache perhaps by setting org.apache.el.BeanELResolver.CACHE_SIZE=-1?\n\nMike"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51717, "attachment_id": null, "text": "It appears as though the Spring Loaded team is willing to add support for clearing this cache in their project.
