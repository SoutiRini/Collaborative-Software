[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "We found two bugs using htpasswd: \n \n1) When including the -c option, an error always occurs, stating that -c and \n-n option is not allowed, even if the -n option is not included. Documentation \nstates that you use this to create a password file, but it doesn't. Rather \nleaving out -c option can already create the password file, when it doesn't \nexist.   \n \n2) However, as per documentation htpasswd is supposed to add additional \npassword entries, when you call htpasswd again. Unfortunately, it overwrites \nthe previously entered password. You have to add an extra space at the end of \nthe file, every time, to add passwords at the end. \n \nIs there an existing fix for this?", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 10762, "id": 19452, "time": "2002-07-12T20:54:15Z", "creator": "jvb@andrew.cmu.edu", "creation_time": "2002-07-12T20:54:15Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Yes, these are both already fixed.
