This strategy has cleaned and improved SaveService cohesion.\nWith this in mind, I would recommend creating a new class: SampleResultConfig , and moving the following methods:\n\nsetDataEncoding\nsetRequestHeaders\nsetTimeStamp\nsetResultFileName\nsetThreadName\ngetEndTime\ngetBodySize\ngetSampleLabel\nsetStampAndTime\ngetLatency\nsetLatency\ngetConnectTime\ngetThreadName\nsetResponseHeaders\nsetResponseCode\ngetResponseMessage\nsetResponseMessage\ngetUrlAsString\ngetSampleLabel\nsetTimes\ngetContentType\nsetSaveConfig\nsetStartNextThreadLoop\ngetResultFileName\ngetResponseData\nsetDataType\ngetTime\ngetAssertionResults\ngetAllThreads\ngetResponseDataAsString\ngetSubResults\nsetSampleCount\ngetSamplerData\nsetSuccessful\nsetResponseMessageOK\ngetStartTime\nsetBodySize\nsetAllThreads\nsetStopThread\ngetURL\ngetDataEncodingNoDefault\ngetBytes\nsetEndTime\nsetStopTestNow\ngetErrorCount\nsetSamplerData\nsetContentType\ngetGroupThreads\nsetResponseData\ngetSaveConfig\nsetResponseData\nsetMonitor\ngetParent\ngetDataType\nsetStopTest\nsetBytes\ngetResponseCode\nsetStartTime\ngetResponseHeaders\nsetErrorCount\nsetSampleLabel\nsetEncodingAndType\nsetHeadersSize\ngetSearchableTokens\nsetResponseCodeOK\ngetSampleCount\nsetURL\nsetGroupThreads\ngetDataEncodingWithDefault\ngetIdleTime\ngetRequestHeaders\ngetDataEncodingWithDefault\nsetConnectTime\nsetResponseOK\ngetMediaType\ngetHeadersSize\ngetTimeStamp\nsetParent\nsetIdleTime\n\nfrom the SampleResult.\nThose parameters accessed by an instance variable in the SampleResult.\nMoreover, the orthogonality is the design would be enhanced.\n\nWhat do you think about that?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for proposal, but approach seems to theorical for me and we have to make some choices regarding our time.\nUnless you propose a PR and impact does not break all plugins , I doubt we will move on this.\nClosing as WONTFIX.\n\nThank you", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 61306, "id": 200598, "time": "2017-09-02T19:15:45Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2017-09-02T19:15:45Z", "is_private": false}]
