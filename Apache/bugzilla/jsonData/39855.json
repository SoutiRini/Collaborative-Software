Internally it uses a BCEL ClassPath object which is used to\nconstruct a Repository.   Regular class loading works just fine.\n\nHowever, when users call getResource or getResourceAsStream, this should be\nperformed with respect to the ClassPath of the ClassLoader.  At first I tried\nusing the getInputStream method of ClassPath, but it assumes the input streams\nare going to correspond to class data.\n\nI have added support for getResource and getResourceAsStream to ClassPath.
