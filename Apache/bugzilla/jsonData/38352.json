If you depend on this, your app is non-portable since \nthere is no requirement that javax.servlet.context.tempdir has any relation to \njava.io.tmpdir.  In fact, a servlet container is perfectly free to set \njava.io.tmpdir to /dev/null if it wants.\n\n> javax.servlet.context.tempdir is now readable.
