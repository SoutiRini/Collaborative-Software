The problem is as follows, when a file ha two extensions, as \nexample test.php.txt i will open when accessing the file test.php as follows \nhttp://serverurl/test.php will open test.php.txt if a test.php does not exist, \ninstead of returning a 404, and the user is not notified of this in any way, \nas the adress is stil lclearly stated as http://serverurl/test.php. When \na \"genuine\" test.php is put in place this file is opened and test.php.txt is \nignored. i cannot see that this would be linked to the php parserer and i \nthink its a bug that occurs with any extensions, though this is not tested. \nthe php parserer was working fine and is version 4.3.0. an illustration of the \nproblem can be found at http://www.dancrea.com/apacheproblem/screencap.gif. i \nam very sorry for taking you time if this bug is in some way irrelevant or i \nhave misstakenly taken it for one."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15706, "text": "Created attachment 4282\nIlustration of the problem.", "id": 28724, "time": "2002-12-29T20:30:19Z", "creator": "gillis.danielsen@dancrea.com", "creation_time": "2002-12-29T20:30:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 4282}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15706, "attachment_id": null, "id": 28725, "time": "2002-12-29T20:51:47Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-12-29T20:51:47Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n  See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_negotiation.html\n\n  You are observing the (correct) behavior of Options Multiviews.\n  Remove Multiviews from the directory you are concerned about and\n  your issue should evaporate.\n"}]
