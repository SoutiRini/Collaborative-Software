Hyperlinks on rows that are getting deleted (overwritten by the shifted rows) also need to be deleted.\n2. I made XSSFHyperlink.setCellReference internal-public rather than using  XSSFHyperlink.getCTHyperlink method (which is unfortunately already public--probably need to do some refactoring to get that back to protected--for now I'm making getCTHyperlink internal-public). In general, no one should need to know about the CT* classes.\n\nPlease take a look at the code and let me know if I'm missing anything.", "id": 186008, "time": "2015-10-27T12:20:59Z", "creator": "onealj@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-10-27T12:20:59Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 33227}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58557, "text": "Created attachment 33228\nExcel spreadsheet test case - before shifting rows\n\nThe test case creates a XSSFWorkbook object from scratch rather than reading in .xlsx files from test-data.
