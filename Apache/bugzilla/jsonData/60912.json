Details mentioned in comments\n\nI am trying to convert doc to html. If doc has font size 11.5 the converted output html will have 11 as size. It's avoiding decimal values. TO avoid this issue I have overridden few methods in WordToHtmlConverter class provided by poi. But I am not able to capture the font size of bullet and bullet colour. Output html doesn't have bullet when customised code is added, I'm not able to retain the colour of the bullet. Kindly provide me solution for this"}]
