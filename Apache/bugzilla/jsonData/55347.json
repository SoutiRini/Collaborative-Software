[{"text": "Created attachment 30663\nPatch, initial draft\n\nFollow on work to Darren Robert's patch of XSSFTextBox: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55292\n\nThis patch integrates those updates into XSSFExcelExtractor and XSSFEventBasedExcelExtractor. \n\nI'm posting the patch for review.  Two items that I'm not sure about:\n\n1) I'm not actually streaming the textbox extraction in XSSFReader.  I followed the model of headers and footers and used the regular XSSF-bean-based objects.\n\n2) I had to change the XSSFDrawing() constructors to public.\n\nWould appreciate any feedback on those issues or on the patch before I commit.\n\nThank you.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 55347, "attachment_id": 30663, "count": 0, "id": 169042, "time": "2013-08-02T14:43:37Z", "creator": "tallison@mitre.org", "creation_time": "2013-08-02T14:43:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "robertsdjguard-poidev@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 169121, "time": "2013-08-05T10:13:02Z", "bug_id": 55347, "creation_time": "2013-08-05T10:13:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I've tried the patch out and it compiled for me, passed the unit tests and when used with another test application successfully resolves this long standing bug:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45551"}, {"text": "Committed r1511789.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 55347, "attachment_id": null, "count": 2, "id": 169311, "time": "2013-08-08T14:04:41Z", "creator": "tallison@mitre.org", "creation_time": "2013-08-08T14:04:41Z", "is_private": false}]
