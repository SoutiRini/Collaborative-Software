If I use the Ajp13 \nconnector that comes with Catalina 4.0.4 instead, the security info is passed \nthough correctly without any manual intervention.  This is useful (essential \nfor me), as the servlet engine can use isSecure() to tell whether the client \nconnected to apache using http or https.
