I've done my best \nworking with the Expression file to handle Lucene-specific searching, and have \nkept the 'contain' only as a reference until the Query's can actually start \nworking (should be 'eq' rather than 'contain' really...).\n\nMost of the work was derived from the TextContains classes so you should see a \nlot of similarity between the two.
