This causes issues with extension, e.g. to use a different file naming strategy, because the rollOver() function directly modifies the value of nextRollover and it's likely that any override of that function would also need to modify it.\n\nTo overcome this issue \"nextRollover\" should be changed to have protected visibility."}]
