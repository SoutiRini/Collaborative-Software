The thing to know about selectors is\nthat they are applied after the directories have been scanned.

So you're probably\nnot seeing an infinite loop but a really long scan, especially because you're\nscanning across the network here as well (I'm assuming V:\\ is big).\nFor name-based in/exclusions you are better off using patternsets.
