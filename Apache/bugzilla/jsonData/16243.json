The \nreason is a change made in the web.xml where, formerly, the servlet-mapping for \nthe Manager servlet was \"/*\".  In 4.1.19, each URL mapping is specifically \nstated (eg... \"/install\", \"/reload\", etc...).  The problem is, someone forgot \nto include \"/deploy\".  Adding that servlet-mapping and adding the same thing to \nthe web-resource-collection solves the problem.\n\nI will attach a working version of the web.xml file.\n\nHopefully this can be fixed before the next releaase of Tomcat-4.1.x.\n\nJake", "id": 29686, "time": "2003-01-19T18:42:18Z", "bug_id": 16243, "creation_time": "2003-01-19T18:42:18Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 4491\nmanager web.xml which supports the \"deploy\" command", "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "attachment_id": 4491, "id": 29687, "time": "2003-01-19T18:44:34Z", "bug_id": 16243, "creation_time": "2003-01-19T18:44:34Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16243, "attachment_id": null, "id": 29688, "time": "2003-01-19T22:27:02Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-01-19T22:27:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This has been fixed."}]
