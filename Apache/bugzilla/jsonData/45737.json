If those look safe, you can add read permission for these files to the juli package in your security policy. See \"per context logging\" in catalina.policy. Note that by CVE-2007-5342 you should make sure, that the webapp provided logging.properties do not try to manipulate data outdise of the context, like overwriting other contexts log files.\n\nFix\n---\n\nA fix has been proposed for backport from trunk. It will log the situation and no longer throw an exception.\n\nThis issue is meant as a reference for users running into the problem. It should be closed after the backport.", "id": 120335, "time": "2008-09-04T00:34:04Z", "bug_id": 45737, "creation_time": "2008-09-04T00:34:04Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 126161, "time": "2009-04-09T07:10:53Z", "bug_id": 45737, "creation_time": "2009-04-09T07:10:53Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This has been fixed in 5.5.x and will be included in 5.5.28 onwards."}]
