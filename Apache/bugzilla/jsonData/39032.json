The only font format SVG engines are required to support is SVG.\n(Batik also support TrueType, and apparently with JDK 1.5+ Type 1 support\nwas added). So we follow the CSS specification to find a replacement \nfont that can display the contnet.\n\nIf might be nice if we issues a warning in this case but CSS actually\nimplies that you must silently accept this case. The content may\ninclude a list of fallback fonts and it would be very annoying to have\na constant stream of warnings about fonts when it will just find a\nlater font that is fine.  So it is hard to know when the failure to\nfind/open a font is a real error and when it is expected.\n\n"}]
