In this case it is called on \"last\" (single page).\n\nThe strange thing is, when i delete in my xml a position (make it shorter) the marker is not inserted.\n\nMany thanks in advance for helping me solve this problem.\n\nRegards\n  Carsten", "id": 161999, "time": "2012-09-07T08:05:20Z", "bug_id": 53839, "creation_time": "2012-09-07T08:05:20Z", "attachment_id": 29339}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 29340\nArchive with Source-XML, Example-PDF and my stylesheet\n\nSorry I had an error in the last update.", "creator": "c.buehler@xdot.de", "is_private": false, "id": 162000, "time": "2012-09-07T08:37:44Z", "bug_id": 53839, "creation_time": "2012-09-07T08:37:44Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 29340}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "do not include XML or XSL Stylesheet; the input to FOP is an XSL-FO file, so please provide a *minimal* XSL-FO file and include that as a separate attachment;\n\nnot providing an XSL-FO file delays evaluation of your bug!", "is_private": false, "id": 162001, "creation_time": "2012-09-07T08:42:51Z", "time": "2012-09-07T08:42:51Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "bug_id": 53839, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "text": "Comment on attachment 29340\nArchive with Source-XML, Example-PDF and my stylesheet\n\nI shall upload the fo-output file.", "creator": "c.buehler@xdot.de", "is_private": false, "id": 162002, "time": "2012-09-07T09:13:49Z", "bug_id": 53839, "creation_time": "2012-09-07T09:13:49Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 29340}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 29341\nFO-Outputfile\n\nI added the outputfile as requested.\n\nP.S.:\nSorry for causing so much administrative work for tihs ticket.
