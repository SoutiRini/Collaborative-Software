A fudge factor (10 seconds) is added to the BusyTimeout setting in the daemon when checking for a timeout, presumably to reduce the likelihood that the timeout is processed (i.e., the daemon releases the procnode structure) but the request thread doesn't think so (i.e., the request thread also releases the procnode structure).\n\nNote that this implementation also requires the busy_timeout value to be propagated from the main server conf to the virtual host conf in fcgid_conf.c.  Hopefully that propagation can be removed when this is resolved.", "id": 130521, "time": "2009-09-18T10:58:06Z", "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-09-18T10:58:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47873, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Regarding the comment \"this implementation also requires the busy_timeout value to be propagated from the main server conf to the virtual host conf in fcgid_conf.c\":\n\nThat was true at one time -- when FcgidBusyTimeout couldn't be set inside a vhost.
