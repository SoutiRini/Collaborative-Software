Patch applied in revision 704008 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=704008). The following modifications were made:\n- minor style fixes (illegal tab characters)\n- System.exit is called at only two places: with a return value of 1 when an unknown argument is given; with a return value of 0 in all other cases. The rationale is that it's not erroneous to simply run fop without argument, or with -v or -h.\n- the help message is accordingly sent to either stderr or stdout\n\nThe semantic of the boolean return value has been changed: false now indicates that processing should stop normally, not because of an error (there are exceptions for that).\n\nIdeally this whole part of the code should be re-worked to make use of a common command-line parsing library (Apache Commons CLI), but this patch is a reasonable trade-off.\n\nPlease re-open the bug if you're not happy with the modifications made.\nThanks Tom!\nVincent", "id": 121463, "time": "2008-10-13T03:48:58Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-10-13T03:48:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "tom.browder@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 121481, "time": "2008-10-13T18:02:20Z", "bug_id": 45971, "creation_time": "2008-10-13T18:02:20Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Patch looks good, Vincent.

The changes are then reflected on the website:\nhttp://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/1.0/changes_1.0.html\n\nI don't remember back then if I just forgot to add an entry relating to this issue, or if I judged that that was too small a change to warrant a log. I've now added one:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1032549\n\nIt will appear on the website soon. A bit late I admit but that may help other users. Was that what you were looking for?\n\nRegards,\nVincent", "id": 141543, "time": "2010-11-08T07:12:33Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-11-08T07:12:33Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45971, "attachment_id": null, "id": 155866, "time": "2012-04-01T06:45:29Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:45:29Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed"}]
