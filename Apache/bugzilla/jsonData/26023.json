The name of the variable is Hidden ( of type \nhidden ) and the value is the result of the regex below. \n\nName : Hidden\nValue : ${__regexFunction(<INPUT type='hidden' name='([^']*)' value='([^']\n*)'>,$2$,ALL,&Hidden=)}\n\nThis works good till the concurrency is around 10.  Above that we start to \nintermittently see HTTP requests where the \"Hidden\" variable has no value in \nthe request (..&Hidden=&...) causing pages which expect this data to fail. This \nhappens on Win NT as well as Solaris. It seemed to be happen less frequently on \na 4 CPU solaris server compared to a single CPU solaris workstation or a single \nCPU WinNT PC.  \n\nI hope the description above is clear.
