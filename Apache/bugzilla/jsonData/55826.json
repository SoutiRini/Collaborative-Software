One of the most interesting was a potential for unsynchronised concurrent accesses to the LinkedList stored in the field RespTimeGraphVisualizer.internalList.\n\nThe list stored in this field can be read from the method RespTimeGraphVisualize.actionPerformed(..), which will be called by the Swing UI thread, and is also modified by the method RespTimeGraphVisualizer.add(..), is a call-graph descendent of the run() method of the thread AsynchSampleSender.Worker thread.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that incorrect data may be read from the list by the UI thread, due to the lack of synchronisation.\n\nWe're not sure that this can actually result in a user-visible bug, but we thought you'd like to know.\n\nWe are also planning to use this finding as an example of Android-related concurrency mistakes in an article about ThreadSafe. Obviously, if you, as the developers of JMeter, have any objections to our using this as an example, then we won't.\n\n[1] ThreadSafe is a static analysis tool for Java concurrency, developed by Contemplate Ltd.:\n     http://www.contemplateltd.com/"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bob@contemplateltd.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I wrote:\n\n> We are also planning to use this finding as an example of Android-related \n> concurrency mistakes in an article about ThreadSafe.\n\nObviously, \"Android-related\" was a mistake here.
