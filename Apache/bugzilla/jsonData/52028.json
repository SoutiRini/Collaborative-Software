If bindOnInit=\"false\", the port number may change multiple times during the life of the connector.\n\nWith multiple connectors using port=\"0\" there will be a naming clash as the connectors need to be registered before the the ports are known.\n\nI see two options.\n\n1. Use auto-1, auto-2 instead of the port number in the JMX names (with a static, thread-safe counter).\n\n2. Re-register the connector and related components when the port number changes.\n\nI'm leaning towards one as it is a heck of a lot simpler.\n\nThoughts?", "id": 151015, "time": "2011-10-28T17:52:55Z", "bug_id": 52028, "creation_time": "2011-10-28T17:52:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52028, "attachment_id": null, "id": 151854, "time": "2011-11-28T23:20:32Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-11-28T23:20:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This has been fixed in trunk and back-ported to 7.0.x.
