It either gets removed (no prameter)\n2. Or it gets filled with just 1 parameter\n3. Or it gets duplicated and filled for each parameter\n\nSince I have to add or remove rows with sheet.shiftRows(3, sheet.getLastRowNum(), n), the merged region in row 9 simply gets deleted.\n\nMerged regions that do not create an overlap with another merged region should not be deleted just like that.
