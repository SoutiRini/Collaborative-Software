All the other files/libraries are \nsuccessfully removed. It might as well be some log4j issue, but perhaps someone \nmight be aware of its weird behaviour in Tomcat apps.\n\nDoes Tomcat releases all context resources when the app is stopped? Or only \nwhen its removed?\n\nThanks a lot,\nJan"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8763, "attachment_id": null, "id": 16294, "time": "2002-05-17T02:43:26Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-05-17T02:43:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This appears to have been fixed in 4.1.2.
