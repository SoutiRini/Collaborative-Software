This gives me the impression that JULI is only reading the config file from the classloader, and not from the Java home directory as documented.\n\nThe Tomcat docs at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/logging.html state:\n\nlogging can be configured at the following layers: In the JDK's logging.properties file. Check your JAVA_HOME environment setting to see which JDK Tomcat is using (or maybe JRE 5.0 as Tomcat can now run on a JRE from version 5.5). The file will be in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib.

There is a rule in the conf/catalina.policy to allow reading that file.\n\nThere are chances that your logging is misconfigured.\n\nTomcat JULI is just an implementation of java.util.logging (JUL), and unless JUL is configured to use JULI when the application starts (using those java.util.logging.* properties passed by catalina.sh) it will not be used. Moreover, Tomcat does not use it directly, but through the commons-logging library.\n\nThat would be a question for the users@ mailing list."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 138070, "time": "2010-07-01T16:06:30Z", "bug_id": 49509, "creation_time": "2010-07-01T16:06:30Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is a configuration issue that belongs on the users mailing list"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49509, "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #4)\n> This is a configuration issue that belongs on the users mailing list\n\nAt a minimum, it seems as if the documentation is incorrect and should be fixed.", "id": 138071, "time": "2010-07-01T17:07:52Z", "creator": "jsb_apache@360works.com", "creation_time": "2010-07-01T17:07:52Z", "attachment_id": null}]
