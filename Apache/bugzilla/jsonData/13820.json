(We don't want to block the CIPHERS \nentirely).\n\nAt first we tried the Syntax using Apache 1.3.27 and mod_ssl-2.8.11-1.3.27 \nrunning on Linux x86 which worked perfectly.\nThen we started to implement it in our 2.0.43 \nservers using the contributed mod_ssl running on Solaris 2.6 which did not work.\nAfterward we \ntried Apache 2.0.43 on Linux which did not work too.\nFinally we tried 1.3.27 Apache using \nmod_ssl-2.8.11-1.3.27 on Solaris 2.6 which (again) worked perfectly. \n\nWe set rewrite-logging \nto debug mode and recognised that all the SSL_* Variables are empty but are correctly written by \nthe ssl log using the custom log format.\n\nAfterwards we tried to run a cgi-bin script showing SSL \nVariables which worked again perfectly.\n\nFinally we tried to access other Environment \nvariables using MOD_REWRITE which again worked without any problem.\n\n\nQuestion : As i \nheared, the mod_ssl contributed with Apache 2.0.43 is an rewriten clone of the mod_ssl module \navailable for Apache 1.3.27.
