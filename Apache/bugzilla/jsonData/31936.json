You have split \nthe font configuration into two parts, one for awt and one for pdf, and I see a \nfew differences between them, but I don't understand what these differences are \naccomplishing. Would you please elaborate a bit on *why* this change solved \nyour problem? My current theory is that any improvement that you have in making \nawt comparable to pdf is probably due to unintentionally getting the awt \nrenderer to use the free-standing fonts instead of the system fonts (see below) \nor maybe vice versa.\n\nAlso, the issue is somewhat bigger than awt vs. pdf, although that can be \nsolved by adding some more roles. The real issue is system fonts (those \nregistered with the o/s), which awt uses, vs. what I call free-standing fonts \n(those using an independent registration system), which pdf and PostScript use. \nSystem fonts don't use or need most of the stuff in the font configuration. The \nfonts used by the two systems can be different, and even if the fonts are \nidentical, the metrics are obtained differently between the two systems.\n\nI have spent much of the past six months refactoring and improving the FOP font \nsystem, and I have partly addressed the issue that you mention, by adding a \nsystem-font element in the font configuration file. It doesn't do much ATM \nexcept recognize that there is a difference. See the notes here: \n(http://www.foray.org/release.html). If you will elaborate a bit on what you \nwould like to see happen, I am interested.\n\nVictor Mote", "id": 65909, "time": "2004-10-28T15:55:15Z", "bug_id": 31936, "creation_time": "2004-10-28T15:55:15Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "The latest changes [1] should achieve the intended goal of this entry as far as\nit is currently possible.
