[{"count": 0, "text": "The rewrite guide incorrect gives an example using BIND syntax that's been\ndeprecated for awhile now. Both 2.0 and 1.3 documentation has the same problem.\n\nThe example is for:\n\nLoad Balancing\nDescription:\n    Suppose we want to load balance the traffic to www.foo.com over\nwww[0-5].foo.com (a total of 6 servers). How can this be done?\n\nThe solution goes on to list multiple cnames for the same label:\nwww    IN  CNAME   www0.foo.com.\n       IN  CNAME   www1.foo.com.\n       IN  CNAME   www2.foo.com.\n       IN  CNAME   www3.foo.com.\n       IN  CNAME   www4.foo.com.\n       IN  CNAME   www5.foo.com.\n       IN  CNAME   www6.foo.com.\n\nThis is incorrect, according to RFC 2181 (and other DNS RFCs):\n\"There may be only one such canonical name for any one alias.\"\nBIND 8 (and prior versions) could be made to work with multiple cnames, but BIND\n9 no longer supports it at all.\n\nThe correct implementation uses multiple A records for the label, like so:\nwww   IN  A       1.2.3.1\n      IN  A       1.2.3.2\n      IN  A       1.2.3.3\n      IN  A       1.2.3.4\n      IN  A       1.2.3.5\n      IN  A       1.2.3.6", "bug_id": 23501, "is_private": false, "id": 44859, "time": "2003-09-29T19:31:36Z", "creator": "daveboynton@aol.net", "creation_time": "2003-09-29T19:31:36Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23501, "attachment_id": null, "id": 47819, "time": "2003-11-21T17:35:59Z", "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-11-21T17:35:59Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I'm going through the bug db to make sure patches are findable.
