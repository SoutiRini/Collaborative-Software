I may have certain files checked out for days and checked out files are \nwritable files on my system until I check them back in.\n4. I want to be able, on a daily basis, to safely re-build my environment from \nscratch, leaving all writable files on my system (checked out files) and \ndeleteing all read-only ones to pick up recent changes.\n\n\nThanks,\nAlex", "id": 28081, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 15552, "creation_time": "2002-12-20T00:43:30Z", "time": "2002-12-20T00:43:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "if you want to write a <readonly> selector for use in defining filesets, we\ncould add it ...
