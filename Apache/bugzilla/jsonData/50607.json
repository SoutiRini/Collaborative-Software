According to the Excel docs, the CLEAN function removes the first 32 nonprinting characters in the 7-bit ASCII code (values 0 through 31). All other characters are not affected. This means that CLEAN does not remove any unicode characters above ASCII, including nonprinting unicode characters (values 127, 129, 141, 143, 144, and 157). I changed your code to follow Excel's rules. \n\nThe ADDRESS function is actually a wrapper around  org.apache.poi.ss.util.CellReference. This is a fundamental class in POI and should be cell reference operations. \n\nYour implementation has a bug and throws IndexOutOfBoundsException for columns greater than 702, i.e. Address.getColName(702) works and Address.getColName(703) fails. I removed this method and used CellReference#formatAsString instead.\n\nOther than that, very good. Thanks for the good patch!\n\nRegards,\nYegor"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50607, "attachment_id": null, "text": "*** Bug 50384 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 143469, "time": "2011-01-19T07:32:08Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2011-01-19T07:32:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50607, "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to comment #3)\n> *** Bug 50384 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***\n\nThanks Yegor.", "id": 143472, "time": "2011-01-19T08:51:36Z", "creator": "contact.aniket@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-01-19T08:51:36Z", "is_private": false}]
