[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Xindice path handling is rather inconsistent in embedded mode.  Specifically I\nrefer to the -d flag in xindice and to system.xml.\n\nFor example, my current directory is \"/home/me/work\", and my Xindice install\ndirectory (XINDICE_HOME) is \"/usr/local/Xindice\".\n\nWhen I run embedded Xindice from an application in /home/me/work the dbroot path\nis looked up relative to the current working directory (or absolute).\n\nWhen I run \"xindice ??? -l -d config/system.xml -c /db ...\" from /home/me/work,\nsystem.xml is looked up from /home/me/work/config/system.xml but the dbroot is\nevaluated from /usr/local/Xindice !  Thus, it finds /usr/local/Xindice/db rather\nthan /home/me/work/db.\n\nThe big problem here is that the command line tools base the relative path in\nsystem.xml from XINDICE_HOME while an embedded app uses the current working\ndirectory.  The workaround here is to use an absolute path in system.xml, but\nthis is unattractive for obvious reasons.\n\nFurther, the command line tools don't seem to like absolute paths for -d. \n'xindice lc -l -d $HOME/work/config/system.xml -c /db' fails because\n/home/me/home/me/work/config/system.xml can't be found.  The relative path seems\nto be prepended to the given absolute path!\n\nThis behaviour has been replicated on Darwin 6.6 (OS X 10.2.6) and linux\n2.4.18-26.8.0smp.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 39719, "creator": "andrew.e.white@motorola.com", "time": "2003-07-01T03:10:42Z", "bug_id": 21209, "creation_time": "2003-07-01T03:10:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21209, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 49686, "time": "2003-12-25T04:07:37Z", "creator": "vgritsenko@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-12-25T04:07:37Z", "text": "There were many changes in path handling in embedded mode.
