If everyone knew what all the webserver terms \nmeant, they would probobly program their own. sorry for wasting your time.\n\nbut thanks for giving some.\n\nRay", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28171, "attachment_id": null, "id": 55211, "creation_time": "2004-04-03T00:34:58Z", "time": "2004-04-03T00:34:58Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "text": "This is a support question wich can be addressed at a user support forum\nlike\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html\n\nIt is certainly true that the docs and faq expect a significant level\nof pre-existing knowledge.
