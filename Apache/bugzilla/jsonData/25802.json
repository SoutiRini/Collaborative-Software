This hack should be removed when\n   the computation of start-indent and end-indent is implemented correctly\n   in StartIndentMaker and EndIndentMaker.\n4) A new method CommonBorderAndPadding.getBPPaddingAndBorder() which returns\n   the sum of all the padding and border size values in the BP direction. \n   The value is used by the block LMs to increase the area height.\n5) Change the method signature of AbstractRenderer.renderBlocks() to\n   also take the parent block (if the parent is a block).\n   This will allow renderBlocks in PDFRenderer to correctly add \n   margin+border+padding to the XXMarginOffset and to restore the values\n   at the end of the block.\n6) Implemented the margin offseting in PDFRenderer.renderBlocks(), rather than\n   doing it as a sideeffect in handleBlockTrait().\n\nThe changes in AbstractRenderer probably break the border and padding in\nthe other renderers.
