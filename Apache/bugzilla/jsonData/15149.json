Each property will be treated as a \nreplacefilter where token is the name of the property and value is the \nproperties value. \n---------\n\nThere's room to improve this feature: we can add one more option to override \nproperty values defined in this file. This file just house default values, the \ncustomized values will be stored in USER_HOME/.ant.properties or elsewhere, so \nthat in a team project, developers don't have to adjust values in the \nreplacefilterfile. \n\nI would be very interested in this feature because after first read I thought I \ncan use the replace task this way and later found it can not be done in the \ncurrent 1.5.1 release. \n\nThanks.", "id": 27503, "time": "2002-12-06T20:17:24Z", "bug_id": 15149, "creation_time": "2002-12-06T20:17:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
