Excel used to auto-size the height of the row in order to display all the wrapping text the first time you opened the xls.  Now it doesn't.  If you manually resize the row height, the wrapping text shows up.\n\nI tried backing off to poi-3.6, and setWrapText seems to work there like it used to in 3.2.\n\nI'm attaching 2 documents - both generated with the same code, but one using poi-3.6 and one using poi-3.8.  The column headers (light gray row 8) wrap in the 3.6 version, but don't wrap in the 3.8 version.", "count": 0, "id": 164637, "time": "2013-01-15T18:20:22Z", "creator": "ryampolsky@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2013-01-15T18:20:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ryampolsky@yahoo.com", "text": "Created attachment 29855\nproduced with poi-3.8", "id": 164638, "time": "2013-01-15T18:21:28Z", "bug_id": 54422, "creation_time": "2013-01-15T18:21:28Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 29855}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54422, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I just tried it with poi-3.9, and the wrapping column headers seem to work again.", "id": 164639, "time": "2013-01-15T18:26:38Z", "creator": "ryampolsky@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2013-01-15T18:26:38Z", "is_private": false}]
