[{"count": 0, "text": "While testing another ClassLoader-related bug, I have bumped into a missing \nfeature in AntClassLoader.java: Ant implements its own ClassLoader, but this \nClassLoader doesnt correctly override all the abstract class methods, \nexpecially the getResource(String). It correctly overrides getResourceAsStream\n(String) by searching the current \"project\" classpath. getResource(String) \nshould do the same.\n\nThis method is particularly useful for configuration file placed in the \nclasspath of the application, and when not correctly implemented, it does \ncreate a serious problem with JUnit for example, which relies on this \nClassLoader to run its tests, unless forked in another JVM (but then it crashes \nsomewhere else: http://nagoya.betaversion.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1658).\n\nThanks!", "creator": "joan@profilium.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 2316, "time": "2001-05-08T09:03:34Z", "bug_id": 1659, "creation_time": "2001-05-08T09:03:34Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1659, "attachment_id": null, "id": 2351, "time": "2001-05-09T08:00:03Z", "creator": "conor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-05-09T08:00:03Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 749 ***"}]
