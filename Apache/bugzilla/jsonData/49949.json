If it is the case I am more than happy to post it at the right place.\n\nThanks."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49949, "attachment_id": null, "text": "As a work-round, you could create a file containing the complete POST body, and upload that, see:\n\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Request\n\n\"If it is a POST or PUT request and there is a single file whose 'name' attribute (below) is omitted, then the file is sent as the entire body of the request, i.e. no wrappers are added.
