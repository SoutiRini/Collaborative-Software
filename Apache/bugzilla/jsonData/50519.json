[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50519, "text": "Hi guys.\n\nI developed a comet server(long polling) with Tomcat 6.0.20. And I tried a long polling with a http keep-alive for eliminate tcp handshake.\n\nBut every time browser tried reuse a socket, tomcat always sent a TCP RST packet. So browser reopen a socket and request a long polling. (keep-alive did not worked.)\n\nWhen I downgraded a Tomcat to 6.0.18, TCP RST was gone. And keep-alive was doing well. I also tested with Tomcat 6.0.29 but it did not worked.\n\nI have found a svn history between 6.0.18 and 6.0.20. It's about COMET_CLOSE processing.\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?revision=645175&view=revision\n\nIs there any bug about cometProcessor and keep-alive?\nI attached a my test comet server.\n\nThank you", "id": 142936, "time": "2010-12-24T03:22:19Z", "creator": "yohlee@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-12-24T03:22:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50519, "is_private": false, "text": "This is a question for the users list.
