[{"attachment_id": 30004, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54621, "text": "Created attachment 30004\nPatch to add custom ping feature\n\nHi,\n\nI've added a feature to mod_jk which provides an alternative to CPING/CPONG to determine if a worker is \"alive\". It allows you to configure a URI to test (using a GET request), and an expected HTTP status code.\n\nworker.tomcat_default.custom_check_expected_status=200\nworker.tomcat_default.custom_check_uri=/app/somefile\n\nThe reason for this is that we do rolling deploys across a cluster of Tomcat servers, and in the time the app is redeploying mod_jk continues to route requests to the Tomcat instance, resulting in 404's to our clients.\n\nIs this something which would be considered for inclusion in mod_jk? Does it need more work?\n\nThanks and Best Regards,", "count": 0, "id": 165536, "time": "2013-02-28T13:27:37Z", "creator": "alan.fitton@igmarkets.com", "creation_time": "2013-02-28T13:27:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54621, "text": "*** Bug 54620 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 165538, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "alan.fitton@igmarkets.com", "creation_time": "2013-02-28T13:45:16Z", "time": "2013-02-28T13:45:16Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54621, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 165543, "time": "2013-02-28T14:00:50Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-02-28T14:00:50Z", "text": "*** Bug 46676 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54621, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 180107, "time": "2014-12-31T15:13:34Z", "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2014-12-31T15:13:34Z", "text": "*** Bug 43341 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}]
