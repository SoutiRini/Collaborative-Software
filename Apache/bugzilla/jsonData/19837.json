I put an entry in the app \nweb.xml deployment descriptor. I also put context path maping in server.xml. \nsontext path name was same as dir name of app in the webapp directory. When \nTomcat was started, listener was loaded once. It`s OK. But when I change \ncontext path name maping from \"/foo\" to \"/myapp\" listener is loaded twice. It \nseems that Tomcat loads one listener for the given context path and also one \nlistener for each aplication with its directory name. Is this a normal behavior \nor not?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Yes, this is expected behavior.
