Which version should be online? The \nnewest (CVS HEAD), the latest released (1.5.3-1), or what? So there is a page \nwhich sais that and gives a link to the newest javadocs generated by gump.\n\nBut that works only if you don\u00b4t have deep links into the javadocs, like here.\n\nIf you have the docs locally that links work.\n\nThe process how to generate the site is documented on \nhttp://ant.apache.org/faq.html#creating-faq.
