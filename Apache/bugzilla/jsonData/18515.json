For example, if I have the pattern\n\n  \"^el\"\n\nand I run\n\n  match( \"hello\", 1 )\n\nthen the match should succeed as the start location is effectively the start \nof the string I want matched against (i.e. the use for this is to save doing a \nsubstring and passing the result instead of the whole string and an index). \nWith the current functionality it only succeeds as a start-of-line for index \n== 0. The corresponding line of code is\n\n                case OP_BOL:\n\n                    // Fail if we're not at the start of the string\n                    if (idx != 0)\n\nI have done a fix that records that startPos in match(String, int) and \ncompares idx to this but do not know if this would have any side-effects so \nhave not included it as a fix.
