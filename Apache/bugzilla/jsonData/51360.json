The Windows Vista/2008 does not have the Try APIs to try get the read/write lock, so in this case (and older OSs), the old APR method is used.\n\nI made an implementation of it, but there is a restriction: The Windows SRW lock is not reentrant, ie, the same thread cannot lock the SRW object more than once.\n\nAttached is the .diff file for win32\\thread_rwlock.c\n\nI hope this patch can be useful.\n\nRegards.", "id": 147037, "time": "2011-06-11T18:32:26Z", "creator": "leandro.becker@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-06-11T18:32:26Z", "is_private": false}]
