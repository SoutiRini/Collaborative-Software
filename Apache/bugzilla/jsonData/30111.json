FYI, This issue \ndoes not have anything to do with PHP as the server is up and running fine.   \n\nI can access the DocumentRoot folder (E:/httproot) fine and I have created a \nfolder (E:/media) which I successfully created a <Directory> directive for.  \nIt seems that when I create any other folder and add a <Directory> directive \nto the server's config, it acts as if I did not add the directive at all and \ncreates an error in the errorlog saying that E:/httproot/<folder name> does \nnot exist.  It is trying to get it from DocumentRoot instead.\n\nIs there a limit or something to the number of <Directory> directives that \nApache will allow on the Windows platform?\n\nAny info would be appreciated.\n\n\nHere is the folder part of my httpd.conf:\n\n#\n# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your\n# documents.
