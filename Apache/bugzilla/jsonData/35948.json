It is mainly provided so that Bertrand can\nstart his work on the OpenType support, basing it on FOrayFont instead of the\nsoon-to-be-removed current font library.\n\nOnly the PDFRenderer is running (note that I didn't say working :-\\ ). All of\nthe other renderers, along with the SVG transcoders currently have compilation\nerrors. So the ant build script cannot be used to create the binary, the\ncompilation directory of Eclipse should rather be used instead.\n\nCurrently there is a bug where digits are displayed instead of normal text with\n\nall fonts but truetype ones. I'm sure this is not a big bug but I haven't found\n\nit yet. I'll look at it ASAP.\n\nThere are a few necessary steps to run the application:\n* A font-configuration file must be provided; currently its path is hardcoded\n  in org.apache.fop.fo.FOEventHandler.java, line 163 (FOrayFontServer.setup(URL\n\n  to the config file))\n* A sample font-config file is provided with this patch; there are 3 paths to\n  change to adapt it to another system:\n  * the path to the dtd which is to be found in the aXSL codebase;\n  * the xml:base attribute of the root element for access to custom fonts;\n  * the base14-root key which should point to the directory of the FOray\n    installation containing the metrics for the base14 fonts.\n  Note that the ending slashes are important!\n\nThe font families which may be used are the generic families (serif,\nsans-serif,\nmonospace), or the names of the fonts configured in the aXSL font-config file.\nFor example, in the provided sample file, there is a font-family entry for the\nBitstream Charter font. Only the upright normal-weight variant has been\nconfigured, which may be accessed in an fo file like the following:\n  <fo:block font-family=\"BitstreamCharter\" font-style=\"normal\"\nfont-weight=\"normal\">\n    Some text displayed with the Bitstream Charter Roman font...\n  </fo:block>\nSo the value of the \"font-family\" attribute in the fo file should match the\nvalue\nof the \"name\" attribute of the font-family element in the config file.\n\nThe jar file contains additional files: two new source files, the jars for aXSL\n\nand FOrayFont (which contain a not yet reported bug fix, so don't use other\nbinaries!), and a sample font-config file.\n\nWell, I think those informations should be enough to get started...", "is_private": false, "id": 94115, "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "time": "2006-09-26T13:56:17Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2006-09-26T13:56:17Z", "attachment_id": 18917}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 18918\nAdditional files: new source files, FOrayFont binaries, font-config file", "attachment_id": 18918, "id": 94116, "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "time": "2006-09-26T13:58:46Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2006-09-26T13:58:46Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "bdelacretaz@codeconsult.ch", "is_private": false, "count": 8, "id": 94121, "time": "2006-09-26T15:02:58Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2006-09-26T15:02:58Z", "text": "I have created a new \"foray-font\" branch to work on this"}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "creator": "bdelacretaz@codeconsult.ch", "attachment_id": null, "id": 94122, "time": "2006-09-26T15:19:57Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2006-09-26T15:19:57Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Some of the files in the patch have svn conflict markers in them, here's the list:\n\n$ find src -name *.java | xargs grep -l '<<<<<'\nsrc/java/org/apache/fop/render/java2d/Java2DGraphicsState.java\nsrc/java/org/apache/fop/render/java2d/Java2DRenderer.java\nsrc/java/org/apache/fop/render/ps/PSRenderer.java\nsrc/java/org/apache/fop/render/ps/PSTextPainter.java"}, {"count": 10, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35948, "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to comment #9)\n> Some of the files in the patch have svn conflict markers in them, here's the list:\n> \n> $ find src -name *.java | xargs grep -l '<<<<<'\n> src/java/org/apache/fop/render/java2d/Java2DGraphicsState.java\n> src/java/org/apache/fop/render/java2d/Java2DRenderer.java\n> src/java/org/apache/fop/render/ps/PSRenderer.java\n> src/java/org/apache/fop/render/ps/PSTextPainter.java\n\nYes, this is to remind me that I still have merging conflicts to resolve.\nCurrently those marks just cause even more compilation errors...", "id": 94128, "time": "2006-09-26T15:56:59Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-09-26T15:56:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 11, "tags": [], "creator": "bdelacretaz@codeconsult.ch", "attachment_id": null, "id": 94170, "time": "2006-09-27T15:29:49Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2006-09-27T15:29:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I have committed the patch with minor changes to the hardcoded pathnames, to\nallow symbolic links to be used for them.\n\nSee \n\n \nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/fop/branches/foray-font/README-foray-font.txt\n\nfor how to run this"}, {"count": 12, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 157120, "time": "2012-04-03T20:58:26Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2012-04-03T20:58:26Z", "tags": [], "text": "vincent, should this bug remain open? is the proposed patch still needed?"}, {"count": 13, "tags": [], "text": "The idea of merging FOrayFont to FOP has been abandoned.", "is_private": false, "id": 157139, "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "time": "2012-04-04T09:22:30Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2012-04-04T09:22:30Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 14, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35948, "attachment_id": null, "id": 158574, "time": "2012-04-30T00:14:54Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-30T00:14:54Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition resolved+wontfix to closed+wontfix"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 15, "id": 158619, "time": "2012-04-30T00:17:22Z", "bug_id": 35948, "creation_time": "2012-04-30T00:17:22Z", "text": "batch transition resolved+wontfix to closed+wontfix; if you believe this remains a bug and can demonstrate it with appropriate input FO file and output PDF file (as applicable), then you may reopen"}]
