Please refer to the menu in attached screenshot. The \"Save Selection As...\" is not translated correctly in Chinese, not \"Export selected items\". \n\nCurrently, \"Save Selection As...\" was translated to \"\u53e6\u5b58\u4e3a\", which actually means \"Save AS\" in English. So some of China users will be mislead to use this item to save JMeter test script. The script saved in this way will up to user's current selection, and it leads to report missing testcase element error when running in non-ui mode and some strange prompts for letting user to save the script before running. The blog in this URL, http://www.jianshu.com/p/e12066ea13b1, describes the problem.\n\nI would suggest to translate it to \"\u9009\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e3a...\", which will be more appropriate.
