This will not work under some class-\nloaders for example\nServletExec3.1. We have faced this problem in many of the projects for example \nXalan. The\nsuggested fix (see attached patch) is to try using the Thread Context \nClassLoader and if that\nfails then use the class'es getResourceAsStream as a fallback mechanism. I have \ntested this patch\nin a few environments with no problems. \n\nThe patch is against the latest CVS. Please accept this patch. This will enable \nCocoon2 to work\nwithout problems. This will not break anything that works now.\n\nThanks,\ndims\n\nPS: See the URL for patch."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2255, "attachment_id": null, "id": 3170, "time": "2001-06-21T11:05:41Z", "creator": "camk@channelpoint.com", "creation_time": "2001-06-21T11:05:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Patch committed.
