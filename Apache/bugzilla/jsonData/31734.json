This is nice, for a human reader. \n \n'apache -L' also produces such information -- including (1) the configuration \ndirective, and (2) a summary of the configuration contexts, in which the \ndirective is valid -- but, this too is produced for a human reader. (Since it \nis produced with a systematic grammar, the 'apache -L' output should be \nparsable, too, but ... \"there must be some other way\") \n \nIf there was a command-line argument (for the 'apache' command), which would \nproduce something /like/ 'apache -L', but would produce it in a \nmachine-parseable form (in a format, maybe, like that of \"gpg --list-keys \n--with-colon\") ... that should be immensely helpful. \n \n \n(Also, for directives such as <directory>, which must have a \"closing \ndelimiter\": a reference to the appropriate \"closing delimieter\" could be \nincluded in the output, too, maybe) \n \n...and if the machine-parsable output would be produced, simply, as plain text \n-- nothing buried in XML -- then that should be ... very, very helpful. \n \n \n(This is needed for an open-source project, at the point of: Something to help \na user/admin to manage configuration directives for 'virtual host' entities. I \ncould say more about the particular project, but there isn't much to show for \nit, yet.) \n \n \n \nThank you, sincerely"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "It looks like you are targetting 1.3, but note that the 2.0 docs come in a nice\nxml format that you could easily parse for this info.", "id": 65204, "time": "2004-10-15T18:52:23Z", "bug_id": 31734, "creation_time": "2004-10-15T18:52:23Z", "attachment_id": null}]
