IOW, it is not because the first column 'spans' two columns, that the second column has \ninitial value 3 as column-number... \nWhat it does mean, AFAICT, is that a fo:table-cell that has column-number 1 will automatically span the \nfirst two columns, such that a following cell having 2 as column-number will cause an overlap.\n\nThe code you offer for number-columns-repeated is interesting, but would fail IIC, unless the repeated \ncolumn is really cloned. If not, then forceColumnNumber() --whatever that method does-- will most \nlikely also alter the column-number of the base column (not only the repeated copy).\n\n\nMy 0.02$\n\nCheers,\n\nAndreas", "bug_id": 38244, "attachment_id": null, "id": 84559, "time": "2006-01-12T20:00:54Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-01-12T20:00:54Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "gerhard.oettl@oesoft.at", "text": "Finaly I would say, that my point of view is not better than the current\nimplementation.
