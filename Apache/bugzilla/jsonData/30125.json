[{"count": 0, "text": "I ran into a small compatibility problem.  The MoveMethod was taking a move\ndestination path like \"/a/b/c.txt\", and converting it to\n\"scheme://server:port/a/b/c.txt\".\n\nUnfortunately, it would do so even if the default port was in use, so instead of:\n\nhttp://server/a/b/c.txt\n\nyou'd get\n\nhttp://server:80/a/b/c.txt\n\nThis caused problems for my application (not using Slide as the back-end). \nWhile I fixed my application, it also seemed like a good idea to fix this in the\nwebdavclientlib for interoperability reasons.\n\nWhile I was there, I noticed that both MoveMethod and CopyMethod assume that the\ndestination is an absolute path on the same server, when it could possibly be a\nfull URL either to the same server or another server.  I concluded that a URL to\na different server must be allowed based on section 8.8.5 and 8.9.4, which list\nstatus code 502 as a valid return.\n\nA small patch for both issues to follow shortly.", "creator": "eric@tibco.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 60643, "time": "2004-07-15T14:59:08Z", "bug_id": 30125, "creation_time": "2004-07-15T14:59:08Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 12118\nfix for default port exclusion and full URL destinations.", "attachment_id": 12118, "id": 60644, "creator": "eric@tibco.com", "time": "2004-07-15T15:01:50Z", "bug_id": 30125, "creation_time": "2004-07-15T15:01:50Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30125, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 60645, "time": "2004-07-15T15:04:19Z", "creator": "eric@tibco.com", "creation_time": "2004-07-15T15:04:19Z", "text": "Oops - changed assigned to to conform to all other bugs."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "eric@tibco.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Changed summary to indicate availability of a patch.
