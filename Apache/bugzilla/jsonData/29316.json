For example, I want Apache to rewrite all requests pointing in direction\nof www.univ-reunion.fr in webapps.univ.run/lenya/univ/live : this is working\nwell, but in the left menu, all URL are : www.univ-reunion.fr/lenya/univ/live\nSo, as you can think, Apache will redirect this to :\nwebapps.univ.run/lenya/univ/live/lenya/univ/live\n\nSOLUTION :\n----------\n\nThis is due to a variable \"root\" in the\nLENYA_HOME/lenya/xslt/navigation/sitetree2nav.xsl\nI have changed in the \"href\" attribute this line :\n <!-- <xsl:value-of select=\"concat($root, $canonical-url)\"/> -->\n      <xsl:value-of select=\"concat($path-to-context, $canonical-url)\"/>\n\nAnd now, it works well.
