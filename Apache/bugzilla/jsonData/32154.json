With a button click on the browser, we \nsend a request to the webservice to run that program. Webservice instantiates \nthis wrapper and keeps a handle to do monitoring stuff. Program itself is \nprocessing around 120K + documents from DB2. The problem that we have is, \nwhenever we process 120k+ docs, tomcat crashes with a core dump towards the end \nof 120k. \nBut, when i run that java wrapper(c++ thing) stand alone on the same machine, \nit runs perfectly fine. \nSo, I tried few things like, increasing the memory (using Xms Xmx switches), \nmaking more swap space in the filesystem for tomcat and db2, increased the \nmemory limit for the process/userid from aix level etc., Im still seeing the \ncore dump. Here's the first few lines from the core dump: \n\nSIGSEGV received at 0xd4b474d8 in </directory/ourlibrary.o>. Processi\nng terminated.\n\nCurrent Thread Details\n----------------------\n    \"ControllerMain\" sys_thread_t:0x3571FE48\n         ----- Native Stack -----\n        unavailable - iar 0x0 not in text area\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ncan somebody help here ?
