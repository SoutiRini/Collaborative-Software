This web application needs to be deployed to a Red Hat Linux EL5, IBM Java5, Tomcat5.5.28 (apache-tomcat-5.5.28.jar.gz Multiplatform binary) environment.\n\nThe project requires migrating a pre-existing Java1.4-19, Tomcat5.0 Web Application.  While migrating found that the naming-common.jar file used by Tomcat5.0 during class loading at startup, failed during startup of Tomcat5.5.28 (see attached log file excerpts).   \n\nTemporary solution:  Recompiled the org.apache.naming.NamingContextBindingsEnumeration class (*) under Sun Java1.5-19, and re-jarred the naming-common.jar as (naming_common.5.0.19.jar) using Ant1.6.5, then used it to replace the naming-common.jar  file in the CATALINA_HOME/common/lib directory.  This has temporarily resolved the issue, Tomcat now successfully starts up under the deployment environment (Red Hat Linux EL5, IBM Java5, Tomcat5.5.28) and the migrated web application is now successfully running there.\n\n(*)  Note: The recompiling of the NamingContextBindingsEnumeration class required changing a class variable labeled as \u2018enum\u2019 to \u2018Enum\u2019 in order to avoid \u2018Reserved Word\u2019 Java1.5-19 compilation error message.   \n\nI need to locate the official Catalina Component Java 1.5 release of the naming-common.jar file for deployment and replace the un-offical temporary re-compiled re-jarred (naming_common.5.0.19.jar) version.  Is a Java 1.5 version of naming-common.jar available at this time?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49016, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 135759, "time": "2010-03-29T14:32:22Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-03-29T14:32:22Z", "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
