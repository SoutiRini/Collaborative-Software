Meaning I've visited the page with my\nbrowser before I do this.\nI get two browsers running on either the same machine or different machines with\ndifferent IP's.  I request the same page with two different GET paramenters. \nI'm hitting the link at the same time on the two browsers.\n\nThe response is unpredictable.  Some times one browswer fails to get a\nresponse.  Sometimes the second browser gets the page intended for the first\nbrowser.  etc.\n\nThis is very severe.  Both connections are https because the information is\nconfidential to our customers.  There is a possibility that one of our customers\ncould see another's information.\n\nI'm serving these pages from RH Linux 7.3 and Tomcat-Catalina 4.0.4\n\nThanks, Rick\nCTO, Syngenium, Inc.\nrick@syngenium.com"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "We would need a test case.
