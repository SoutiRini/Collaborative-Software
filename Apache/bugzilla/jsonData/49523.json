The link provided for each context is a convenience link for an admin to jump into the respective context. The link assumes, that there is some reasonable content available directly under the context path. This might be true for some contexts that use e.g. welcome pages or have a servlet mapping for /, but there will also be contexts which do not produce any reasonable response when their conext root is called.\n\nYes, manager and host-manager are not general applications but instead provided by the Tomcat project. Nevertheless producing special links just for the manager and host-manager will bloat the code and only work as long as the admin doesn't deploy them under a different context name - or doesn't deploy something else under the names manager or host-manager.
