When one changes the \ninstalled JDK/JRE (and thus usually has a new JAVA_HOME dir), the service won't \nstart anymore.\nAs the flexibility gained by once defining JAVA_HOME as an environment variable \nis so nice, i would suggest not to hardcode this parameter and instead use the \nenvironment variable value. the documentation should be upgraded as well to \ninform win2k/xp-users they shall define JAVA_HOME as system, not user variable.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "text": "This cuts both ways. If JAVA_HOME is used then installing a new JVM and changing JAVA_HOME (without removing the old install) will change the JVM the service is using which may not be what was intended.\n\nThe current windows installer includes the GUI management tool that makes changing the JVM being used easy.\n\nI believe the benefits of not using JAVA_HOME outweigh the benefits of using it.", "bug_id": 14097, "is_private": false, "id": 142722, "time": "2010-12-14T19:55:22Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-12-14T19:55:22Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
