[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The servlet request getCharacterEncoding method always returns the string \"ISO-8859-1\".  I have set the character set of the response using method setContentType() in the previous execution to \"text/html charset=UTF-8\".  Both Netscape and Internet Explorer recognize this charset as eight bit compressed Unicode and correctly display and enter characters using the specified encoding.  Netscape also returns the request header with a \"charset=UTF-8\" entry.  However, IE does ont place a charset entry in the request header.  \r\nSo, for Netscape, the getCharacteEncoding() method should return the string \"UTF-8\" (or converted to JAVA name 'UTF8').  For IE, the getCharacterEncoding() method should return NULL because no character encoding was specified in the request header.\r\n", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 460, "id": 429, "time": "2001-01-16T12:08:50Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-01-16T12:08:50Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 460, "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 461 ***", "id": 5391, "time": "2001-09-11T19:41:38Z", "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-11T19:41:38Z", "attachment_id": null}]
