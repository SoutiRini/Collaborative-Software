[{"count": 0, "text": "I find the page http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/ssl-howto.html quite difficult to use, and confusing.\n\nThe top of the page says:\n\n\"This Howto refers to usage of JSSE, that comes included with jdk 1.5 and higher. When using APR, Tomcat will use OpenSSL, which uses a different configuration.\"\n\nThis implies that the APR description is to be found elsewhere, however there is no link, and in fact, the APR settings are described further down the page.\n\n[Also, surely JSSE is included in Java 1.4+? (and it does not have to be jdk, jre will do).]\n\n==\n\nI found the section headed \"Edit the Tomcat Configuration File\" confusing.\n\nThe configuration details for APR and JSSE are intermixed, and the table showing the attributes only mentions common or JSSE atributes, the APR-only ones are not mentioned.\n\nIMO it would be better to have an introductory paragraph which describes the two different methods, and how to choose between them, and then explain how to set each of them up. The attributes table could have an extra column showing which entries are JSSE, APR or common.\n\n==\n\nI can provide a patch; please let me know if that would be useful.", "bug_id": 47231, "is_private": false, "id": 127230, "time": "2009-05-21T03:58:55Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-05-21T03:58:55Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47231, "attachment_id": null, "id": 127346, "time": "2009-05-24T16:53:19Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-05-24T16:53:19Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Patches always welcome."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": 23719, "id": 127439, "time": "2009-05-27T05:25:21Z", "bug_id": 47231, "creation_time": "2009-05-27T05:25:21Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 23719\nTomcat / OpenSSL how-to\n\nFeel free to make as much or as little use of the attached how-to as you see fit.\n\nNote 1: You can use the separate pem encoded key and cert files directly with the APR/native SSL connector.\n\nNote 2: These were only ever meant to be personal notes for my test environment.
