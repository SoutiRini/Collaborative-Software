Your wish is my command.\n\nIn regards to the following commit (which applies to 0.9.4 and HEAD as well):\n\nhttp://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apr/threadproc/unix/proc.c?\nr1=1.64&r2=1.65&diff_format=h\n\nThe first call to access(2) (line ~322) for attr->currdir requires R_OK and \nX_OK.  This looks to be incorrect; R_OK is superfluous, as chdir(2) only needs \nthe directory executable bit to succeed (at least on *IX systems).\n\nIn English: chdir(2) will fail when trying to go into a directory that lacks \nthe read bit.  This was discussed (mainly by myself) in full over at the suPHP \nforum, since all versions of suPHP (with Apache 2) are affected by this issue:  \nhttp://lists.marsching.biz/pipermail/suphp/2004-July/000756.html\n\nIf someone could take a peek at this, I'd appreciate it.
