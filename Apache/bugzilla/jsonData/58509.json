This breaks existing behaviour.\n\nThe workaround is to hook \"almost last\", however this is imprecise as other modules (eg mod_dialup) may specify the same precendence.\n\nSuggest this change is documented for module authors?", "is_private": false, "id": 185813, "creator": "apache-b6e@deemzed.uk", "time": "2015-10-20T13:35:53Z", "bug_id": 58509, "creation_time": "2015-10-20T13:35:53Z", "attachment_id": 33188}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "apache-b6e@deemzed.uk", "attachment_id": 33189, "id": 185814, "time": "2015-10-20T13:48:22Z", "bug_id": 58509, "creation_time": "2015-10-20T13:48:22Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 33189\nExample workaround for module"}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 58509, "is_private": false, "id": 190986, "time": "2016-05-16T14:41:17Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-05-16T14:41:17Z", "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the report.\n\nI don't think there's a good place to capture this (for others to find it) other than here in this bug report. \n\nClosing with a somewhat bogus value so it doesn't show as an open issue."}]
