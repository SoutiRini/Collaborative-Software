Diff does not contain directory info.\n\nCurrently, Tomcat will refuse to start if the $CATALINA_PID file is found. If the Tomcat process dies and the $CATALINA_PID is not cleaned up, then the user ends up in the annoying circumstance of not being able to start or stop tomcat using the provided scripts.\n\nThis patch will test whether the process the the PID file stores actually exists, and if not then it will start tomcat anyway. Starting tomcat will also replace the PID file with a new version."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50130, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 50084 ***", "id": 140896, "time": "2010-10-21T07:58:33Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-21T07:58:33Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
