The problem is when apache is starting with a \nparticular worker/channel disabled.   Because the lb_value is initially set to zero, that \nparticular worker cannot be enabled without restarting apache. \n \nI had thought I'd seen lb_value at zero without an apache restart, but I cannot \nreproduce it now.

So if you want to start apache with only 1 ajp worker enabled, you \ncan never add another worker without disrupting existing \"sticky\" sessions. \n \nAs a work around, I've altered my apache start script to modify workers2.properties, \nstart apache, disable the workers that were previously disabled, and HTTP GET \n/jkstatus/ to pick up the changes.
