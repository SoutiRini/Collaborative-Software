To see that you have to manually diff the files.\n- Even more important you didn't do your changes against the latest files in \nCVS. This again makes it very difficult to apply the patch. And it takes a LOT \nof time. Please send CVS patches next time (See URL below).\n- Your changes need to be revisited. You've introduced quite a bit of \nduplicate code (ex. in PropertyListBuilder). That can be improved to make it \nmore readable.\n- Now the hammer: We appreciate your effort to improve FOP's performance very \nmuch but unfortunately, we have set the maintenance branch of FOP to bugfixing \nmode only. The branch will be frozen after 0.20.5 so we can focus on the \nredesign. I can only speak for myself, but I'd rather not apply your changes. \nI'm sorry I have to say this.\n\nI would like to encourage you to read the instructions on contributing to FOP. \nYou can find them here: http://xml.apache.org/fop/dev/index.html\n\n(fellow committers: reopen the bug if I'm totally out of line.)"}, {"count": 4, "text": "<Q>\nUsing member variables may also be beneficial for the logger functionality, \ngiven the many getLogger().xxxx() calls currently in the trunk branch.\n</Q>\n\nSure, but it also blows up the instance/object size and if there are a lot of \ninstances (like in the FO tree) this can quickly account for a lot more memory \nwhich in turn can slow down things again. We would have to investigate that \nvery carefully.
