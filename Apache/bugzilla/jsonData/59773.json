At best this is a lot of function calls. At worst, this is a lot of expensive function calls.\n\nWe can pretty easily find cases where we can make POI faster by moving loop invariants (value doesn't change over the for loop, function doesn't have any side-effects) outside the loop.\n\ngrep -r --exclude-dir=\".svn\" -P \"for\\s*\\([^:\\(]+\\(\\)[^:\\)]+\\)\"\n\nThis finds function calls within a for loop, excluding for-each loops.\n\nThere are currently 514 instances.
