To do anything with headers and footers, just call\ngetHeader() from HSSFSheet (or getFooter()).  This will give you access to the \nheader and footer to the sheet without the need of any sort of set method (it \nstores the reference to the record).\n\nFYI:  when creating a diff do cvs diff -u.  This is the format that most \ncommitters want to deal with."}]
