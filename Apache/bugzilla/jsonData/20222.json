[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nAttached is a patch implementing a <type> Selector, which lets one select only\ndirectories:\n\n<filetype src=\"${src}\">\n  <type type=\"dir\"/>\n</filetype>\n\nOr only regular files, with <type type=\"file\"/>\n\nI found this useful in conjunction with the <different> selector, which regards\ndirectories as always different. Possibly this is a separate bug, but I thought\na generic 'type' selector would be a useful addition anyway.\n\nThe idea of a 'type' selector could easily be extended further to include:\n - is file readable\n - is file writeable\n - file exists\n - file is hidden\n\nFeedback on whether/how to do this appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n--Jeff", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 20222, "id": 37764, "time": "2003-05-25T04:50:26Z", "creator": "jefft@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-05-25T04:50:26Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": 6482, "tags": [], "creator": "jefft@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 37765, "time": "2003-05-25T04:51:28Z", "bug_id": 20222, "creation_time": "2003-05-25T04:51:28Z", "text": "Created attachment 6482\nPatch implementing and documenting TypeSelector"}, {"count": 2, "text": "I am working on your contribution, creating a testcase for it.", "bug_id": 20222, "attachment_id": null, "id": 37778, "time": "2003-05-25T11:07:45Z", "creator": "levylambert@tiscali-dsl.de", "creation_time": "2003-05-25T11:07:45Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "levylambert@tiscali-dsl.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 37779, "time": "2003-05-25T11:45:15Z", "bug_id": 20222, "creation_time": "2003-05-25T11:45:15Z", "text": "patches submitted, thanks."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Looks fine.
