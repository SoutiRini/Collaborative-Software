[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi Jakarta Team,\n\n  Looks as if in Tomcat 4.1.x you are using jspDestroy() to do tag \npool cleanup. This cleanup should probably be placed in a destroy() method.\n\nBasically, my JSP contains the following (I can send you a WAR file with the \ntest code if you email me):\n\n\n<%@ taglib uri=\"/WEB-INF/tlds/bug-taglib.tld\" prefix=\"test\" %>\n\n<!-- Should be perfectly legal. -->\n<%! public void jspDestroy() {\n      System.out.println(\"In jspDestroy\");\n    }\n%>    \n\n<test:doLittle />\n   \nwhich produces two jspDestroy's in the generated servlet.  The extra  \njspDestroy is:\n\n  public void jspDestroy() {\n    _jspx_tagPool_test_doLittle.release();\n  }\n\nAnd of course, with two jspDestroy methods, the code does not compile.\n\nThanks,\nLarry Brown\nbrown@corewebprogramming.com", "is_private": false, "id": 26865, "creator": "brown@corewebprogramming.com", "time": "2002-11-23T15:06:02Z", "bug_id": 14798, "creation_time": "2002-11-23T15:06:02Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14798, "attachment_id": null, "id": 26957, "time": "2002-11-25T18:46:47Z", "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "creation_time": "2002-11-25T18:46:47Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 14197 ***"}]
