The one \ntaking Level has been marked deprecated with a stern instruction that it would be removed without \nreplacement.\n\nThe method is used in a few places (resulting in deprecation warnings) and since it is stronger typed than \nthe String method, you'd think the String method would be deprecated first.\n\nI could not find any discussion on why it was marked such and don't understand the motivation, so I'm \nremoving the deprecation tag."}]
