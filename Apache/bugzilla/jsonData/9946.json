This is not intended the body should be skipped at \nthe start only as nothing should be excuted in else tag / in if tag depending on condition.\n\nThus \nin IFThenTag it is necessary to do following :\n        if( ! parent.getCondition() )\n        {\n            return \nSKIP_BODY;\n        }\n\nSimilarly in IFElse Tag :\n        if( parent.getCondition() )\n        {\n            return \nSKIP_BODY;\n        }\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\nSachin", "bug_id": 9946, "is_private": false, "id": 17971, "time": "2002-06-18T08:39:22Z", "creator": "sachinsah@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2002-06-18T08:39:22Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9946, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 27218, "time": "2002-12-01T22:49:20Z", "creator": "glenn@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-12-01T22:49:20Z", "text": "The utility taglib is deprecated.
