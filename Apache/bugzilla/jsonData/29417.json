The problem is that \n\n-ilx-myproperty\n\nis guaranteed to not parse in any conformant CSS parser, so it is not even possible to have \nadditional(!) proprietary properties in otherwise fully parseable CSS files. The suggested solution in \na discussion on www-style@w3c.org was to quote the leading hyphen and thus make the whole \nstylesheet parseable.\n\nHowever, the Batik CSS parser does not seem to recognize\n\n\\-ilx-myproperty\n\nas a valid identifier name.
