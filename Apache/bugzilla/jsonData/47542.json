ErrorLog) for the still running child processes during their shutdown process.\n\nUsing static files instead of a piped log handling program everything works fine.\n\nI think worker processes (like FastCGI processes) should be stopped before Apache httpd tries to shut down the transfer logging processes and only thereafter should it try to shutdown the ErrorLog processes as a last step.", "id": 128913, "time": "2009-07-16T08:00:55Z", "creator": "ujvari@microsec.hu", "creation_time": "2009-07-16T08:00:55Z", "is_private": false}]
