The thing that \nchanged was instead of returning null which tells the parser to try to find it on its own, an empty \nInputSource is returned which will prevent the parser to try to find it on its own.  So hopefully you lost the \nexception from the parser when it could not find log4j.dtd.  Could downgrade it from a LogLog.error to a \nLogLog.warn.\n\nThere are two issues here: one is what do in the case that the resource can not be found.  Other than \npotentially downgrading the message to a LogLog.warn, I think the fix is good.
