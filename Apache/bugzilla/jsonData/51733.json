Assume 3 threads have been blocked so far.\nRerun the test and let it run.\nYou will notice the SyncTimer will unblock after 2 threads and not 5.\n\nThe reason is that when the test is started, the clone() method is called on the SyncTimer to created a new one. Since the test interruption left the previous SyncTimer with already 3 threads \"registered\", this value (3) will be used in the cloned SyncTimer.\n\nEncountered in JMeter 2.5 r1158837", "id": 148872, "time": "2011-08-29T05:41:55Z", "creator": "gruwez@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-08-29T05:41:55Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": 27875, "text": "Created attachment 27875\nTest Plan to reproduce issue", "id": 151065, "time": "2011-10-31T06:10:22Z", "bug_id": 51733, "creation_time": "2011-10-31T06:10:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 51733, "text": "Date: Mon Oct 31 06:10:52 2011\nNew Revision: 1195344\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1195344&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 51733 - SyncTimer is messed up if you a interrupt a test plan\n\nModified:\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/components/org/apache/jmeter/timers/SyncTimer.java\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 151066, "time": "2011-10-31T06:12:11Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-31T06:12:11Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "is_private": false, "id": 151519, "time": "2011-11-15T17:18:30Z", "bug_id": 51733, "creation_time": "2011-11-15T17:18:30Z", "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 52185 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}]
