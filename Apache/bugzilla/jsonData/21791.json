To make the long \nURL (or any text) wrap, FOP requires a space of some kind. \n\nI have tried to pre-process my XML inserting a zero-width space (&#x200B;). \nThis looks OK in the PDF as it wraps and the tooltip works fine, but when \nclicking it, the hyperlink doesn't work as it has inserted a question mark \n(\"?\") in the position of the zero-width space. \n\nI have also inserted a normal space (\" \") instead of the zero-width space. This \nwill force the wrapping of the long URL and works when clicking on it, but the \ntooltip shows the space and since I want all \"/\" replaced with \"/ \", this looks \nterrible."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21791, "attachment_id": null, "id": 41157, "time": "2003-07-22T12:39:41Z", "creator": "j3322ptm@yahoo.de", "creation_time": "2003-07-22T12:39:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "There seems to be a misunderstanding.
