It is \npossible to set encoding to normal cell in sheet (HSSFCell.setEncoding), but I \nneed set encoding to header too. I would like use Slovak characters \nlike '\u00be' '\u00e8' '\u0161' '\u009d' '\u017e' in my sheet's header. What would I do?\n\nJan Vinter"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 17132, "attachment_id": null, "id": 41342, "time": "2003-07-24T15:43:29Z", "creator": "poi-support@buni.org", "creation_time": "2003-07-24T15:43:29Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is a question...use hte mail list for questions"}]
