For relative uris in xml\ncatalogs located at file system (and likely in other cases where file URI is\nreturned), the URI is returned in form \"file:c:/dir/file.txt\", but apparently\nthis form of URIs is not recognized as hierachical URI. I have found a\nworkaround for this problem (it just adds \"/\" before letter+\":\" and after\n\"file:\" if it is not there), but I would really like to have problem fixed. The\nproblem was encountered when using the following catalog file:\n\n<catalog xmlns='urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog' prefer=\"system\">\n\t<public publicId='-//XJ//XJ Standard 0.0' uri=\"./xj.grammar\"/>\n</catalog>\n\nBelow is an answer to my message about having problem with such URIs\nreturned by resolver in EMF (www.eclipse.org/emf).\n\nAs a fix, I suggest to add slash on win32 platform before path.\n\nConstantine\n-----------------------------------------\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=3220&group=eclipse.tools.emf\nThe password could be obtained at page: http://www.eclipse.org/newsgroups/index.html\n\n\nHi Constantine,\n\nHere is the problem exactly: \"file:C:/dir/file.txt\" is a valid URI, and EMF\nhandles it, but it is not considered a hierarchical URI according to RFC 2396,\nand hence, according to EMF.  In order to be considered a hierarchical URI, the\nscheme-specific part must begin with a slash, so for example, \"file:/c:/tmp.txt\"\nis hierarchical.\n\nBecause your URI is not hierarchical, it has no segments, hence no last segment,\nand no extension.  So, EMF looks for a resource factory registered against the\nnull-string extension and finds none.  That produces the execption you see.\n\nSomeone introduced a hack into EMF 1 that allowed URIs of that form to be\nconsidered hierarchical, but that broke resolve(), so we decided to go back to\nthe proper definition from the RFC in EMF 2.0.\n\nCheers,\nDave", "id": 51657, "time": "2004-02-03T15:17:21Z", "bug_id": 26631, "creation_time": "2004-02-03T15:17:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "apache-bugzilla@nwalsh.com", "text": "I think it's possible that the fixes I made for bug #28719 also fix this\nproblem, but I have no way to test it.
