It's probably a duplicate of bug #45047 but I need to further investigate to be sure. Basically the fixed heights set on table-row elements are creating trouble. If you remove them you get the same result without the spurious page.\n\nI can imagine the stepping effect you want to achieve by setting heights on the table rows. I guess you're not happy with the result FOP currently produces (without regards to the spurious page)? :-\\\n\nVincent"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45134, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 157310, "time": "2012-04-07T01:41:23Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:41:23Z", "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 157895, "time": "2012-04-11T06:16:35Z", "bug_id": 45134, "creation_time": "2012-04-11T06:16:35Z", "is_private": false, "text": "change status from ASSIGNED to NEW for consistency"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "chuck.mccallum+fop@jove.com", "text": "I found this bug via http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-fop-users/201103.mbox/browser. \n\nIt's ugly, but if anyone needs an ad-hoc work-around, you can add an invisible \"word\" of non-breaking spaces so that the content of the cell actually spans as many rows as have been allotted for it. ie, replace\n\n<fo:table-cell number-rows-spanned=\"2\">\n   <fo:block>Too short!</fo:block>\n</fo:table-cell>\n\nwith\n\n<fo:table-cell number-rows-spanned=\"2\">\n   <fo:block>Too short &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</fo:block> \n</fo:table-cell>\n\nThe invisible word gets line wrapped, assuming your table is narrow enough, and the new block of text is not vulnerable to page-breaking from this bug.\n\nFor what that's worth.", "id": 160293, "time": "2012-06-27T15:30:19Z", "bug_id": 45134, "creation_time": "2012-06-27T15:30:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
