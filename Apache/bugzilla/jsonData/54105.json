There is nothing wrong with Acceptor thread waiting for incoming connections. \n\nIt is its job to wait for those.\n\n2. \"2\" is the value of JkHandler.ERROR.\n\nNothing more can be said from that.\n\n3. The Catalina$CatalinaShutdownHook thread (\"Thread-19\") is stalled in unLockSocket(). That is, trying to open a new connection to Tomcat. That is normal.\n\nIf the acceptor thread is in good state (waiting on a socket) and new connections cannot be made, the cause is somewhere in the network libraries, out of the control of Tomcat.\n\nIf you need further help with it, ask on the users list.\n\nMaybe you could use other tools to diagnose your network, maybe you are hitting ulimits.\n\nMaybe you have hit OutOfMemory some time earlier (and as a consequence your JVM is hardly usable any more).\n\n\n4. A \"critical\" issue?\n\nNote that 6.0.29 is more than 2 years old. A number of issues has been fixed since then, including some issues with AJP protocol and some security issues.\n\nClosing as INVALID.\n\nBTW, the org.apache.jk implementation of AJP protocol was removed from later versions of Apache Tomcat.
