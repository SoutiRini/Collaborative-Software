[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nWe are using mod_jk 1.2.15 and tomcat 2.0.58 for the application. We have 2 \nweb server connecting to 9 tomcats running 3 on each machine. We have set the \nsticky session to true and expect the session to stick to one tomcat. But some \nhow the session goes on to another tomcat and the user gets a session timeout \nerror. The tomcat which was serving the user request earlier does not hang or \nanything. It can respond to other requests. Some this seem to be issue with \nmod_jk in not sending the request back again to the same tomcat.\n\nThanks,\nAravind", "attachment_id": null, "id": 97972, "creator": "aravind.ch.kumar@gmail.com", "time": "2007-01-11T17:12:36Z", "bug_id": 41354, "creation_time": "2007-01-11T17:12:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "At first glance this looks like a configuration issue.
