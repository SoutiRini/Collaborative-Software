Not sure if this sits \nright with you all, but it just seemed like the best of options... Guaranteed only one separate instance \nper document, easy access etc.\n\nHave a look and let me know if it needs improvement.\n\nCheers,\n\nAndreas", "id": 82868, "time": "2005-11-25T19:25:30Z", "bug_id": 37639, "creation_time": "2005-11-25T19:25:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37639, "attachment_id": 17043, "id": 82869, "time": "2005-11-25T19:26:37Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-11-25T19:26:37Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 17043\nDiff of the modified classes against TRUNK"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37639, "text": "No vetoes received on this one, so committed:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=360083&view=rev", "id": 84081, "time": "2005-12-30T14:35:04Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-12-30T14:35:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 156046, "time": "2012-04-01T06:55:32Z", "bug_id": 37639, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:55:32Z", "is_private": false}]
