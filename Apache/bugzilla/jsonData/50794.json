[{"text": "I'm using FOP 0.95 in XMLSpy.\n\nWhen I flow content from a first page having a simple-page-master onto a second (rest) page having a more narrow region-body, the content on the second page has the same width as the content on the first page, overflowing the body. This also happens if I set the column-count on the second page to be greater than the column-count on the first page.\n\nHow do I force the engine to recognize that the available horizontal space has been decreased, and adjust the body (or column) width accordingly?\n\nA stylesheet that demonstrates the problem is attached (use with any XML document that contains sufficient text content to flow from page 1 to page 2).", "tags": [], "bug_id": 50794, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 144337, "time": "2011-02-15T23:30:50Z", "creator": "temp1031ks@ama3.com", "creation_time": "2011-02-15T23:30:50Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "temp1031ks@ama3.com", "attachment_id": 26664, "text": "Created attachment 26664\nstylesheet that demonstrates overflow problem", "id": 144338, "time": "2011-02-15T23:32:07Z", "bug_id": 50794, "creation_time": "2011-02-15T23:32:07Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "Hi,\n\nthe problem you describe is known as Changing IPD problem.
