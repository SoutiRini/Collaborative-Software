And this is how I found it:\nI've put AuthName with a very long value into my .htaccess file.\nIn the error_log, httpd reported the following:\n\n/var/www/htdocs/_files_/aaa/.htaccess: Invalid command 'AAAAAAA (and loads of As \nafter this)\n\nAfter certain amount of padding chars httpd started to treat the string as a new\ndirective. And when its value was long enough (still in the same line) it \nbegan to treat it as a new directive again from a certain character.\nAll in one line, as a value of AuthName.\n\nCan't say if it happens to other directives as well (I'd say so, though\nI didn't give it a try) and what's the impact on the security.\n\nPlease have a look at the following website with a sample (working) PoC:\nURL: http://cepter.net/misc/htaccess\n\nServer version: Apache/1.3.37 (Unix)\nServer built:   Feb 21 2007 19:08:11\n\nHaven't tried this on Apache HTTPD 2.0.\n\nRegards\n\n-- \nPeter"}]
