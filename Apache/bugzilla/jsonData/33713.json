Unfortunately after upgrading from Tomcat\n5.0 to 5.5.7 we've found this results in a NullPointerException (unless the\nadmin webapp has already been loaded).\n\nI've had a look at the code, and the reason seems to be Remm's commit to web.xml\nand login.jsp on 16-Aug-04 (affecting Tomcat 5.5.0 and above) that stopped the\nadmin app being loaded on startup and instead loads its internals when the login\n.jsp page is visited.\n\nThis fix obviously assumes that the login page is always visited before the\nadmin webapp is accessed - an assumption that is not valid when using SSO. \n\nI suggest either reversing the previous commit and turning load-on-startup on\nagain; or alternatively, adding the line that was added to login.jsp to\nframeset.jsp as well (someone would need to confirm if this works OK, as I don't\nknow)."}, {"count": 1, "text": "Hmm...
