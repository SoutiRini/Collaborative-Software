Seems that when I have the GUI open and select my request, and the Parameters Tab and save, I get a defferent .jmx file than if I select the Body Data tab and save.  I'm not actually adding or modifying the script at all, only the Tab I select before the save operation.  When I select the Body Data tab for this request and save there are extra elements that are added to the .jmx file:\n\n <boolProp name=\"HTTPArgument.always_encode\">false</boolProp>\n <stringProp name=\"Argument.value\"></stringProp>\n <stringProp name=\"Argument.metadata\">=</stringProp>\n\nThese actually cause the request to fail as it no longer sends the file contents to the server when POSTing.", "id": 182269, "time": "2015-04-07T18:54:46Z", "creator": "project.hay@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-04-07T18:54:46Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57797, "text": "Hi,\nThis is a regular behaviour.\n\nYour issue is not related to this, please ask on user mailing list providing more details on what you send, your configuration and the error you get.\n\nRegards", "id": 182468, "time": "2015-04-18T12:04:22Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2015-04-18T12:04:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
