The problem is that certain poorly maintained browsers, and even \nthe validator.org validator, don't bother specifying which types they expect, \nand so the .rss file might be served to them.  A reasonable solution is to \nlower the qs value for the .rss variant.  Currently, for the directory index, \nI have to make a map file like this: \n \nURI: index \n \nURI: index.rss \nContent-type: application/rss+xml; qs=.1 \n \nURI: index.en.html \nContent-type: text/html \n \nURI: index.fr.html \nContent-type: text/html \n \n. \n. \n. \n \nObviously that's difficult to maintain if you have many variants of a \nresource.  I would much rather just set the qs of index.rss, as shown at the \nbeginning of this report.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29446, "attachment_id": null, "text": "In the example I gave, it turns out that the map file must be even more \nverbose and redundant, as it seems that Content-language must be provided for \neach item in order for content negotiation to work: \n \nURI: index  \n  \nURI: index.rss  \nContent-type: application/rss+xml; qs=.1  \nContent-language: en \n  \nURI: index.en.html  \nContent-type: text/html  \nContent-language: en \n  \nURI: index.fr.html  \nContent-type: text/html  \nContent-language: fr \n  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n ", "id": 58896, "time": "2004-06-08T21:39:54Z", "creator": "john@neggie.net", "creation_time": "2004-06-08T21:39:54Z", "is_private": false}]
