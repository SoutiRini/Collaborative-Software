As I firewall\naccess to the Jetty to all but apache this means that my 'live' tab link is dead\nto anyone clicking on it from their broswer.\n\nThis what the generated html looks like in the default pub for the tabs in a\ntest installation I did today.  I gave up and went back to Lenya 1.2.4 where\nthis problem does not exist:\n<a href=\"/default/admin/index.html\" target=\"_self\"><span>admin</span>\n<a href=\"/default/info-authoring/index.html\" target=\"_self\"><span>Site</span>\n<a href=\"/default/authoring/index.html\"><span>authoring</span>\n<a href=\"http://t1webtest.triumf.ca:8888/default/live/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\n cheers, etc.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 105126, "creator": "deatrich@gmail.com", "time": "2007-07-05T18:03:33Z", "bug_id": 42825, "creation_time": "2007-07-05T18:03:33Z", "is_private": false}]
