Last message was a couple of months ago.  I checked the CVS and did not \nsee any change.\n\nSee http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21546 for an example of \nmod_jk2 conflicting with mod_dav.  Another example follows for mod_jk2 and \nmod_rewrite:\n\nIf I have:\n\n  RewriteRule    ^/oldpathpart(.*)$         /newpath/   [NC,L,R=permanent]\n  JkSet uri:<domain>/*.jsp.group ajp13:worker\n\nthen /path1111/ goes to /newpath/ with no trouble.  BUT ...\n\n  /path1111/foo.html - works\n  /path1111/foo.jsp  - gets an error because of mod_jk2 takes precedence.\n\nThis whole module precedence area seemingly needs to be work out with the \nhttpd team, since administrative control was removed in Apache 2.  But it \nsounded from the tail end of the thread that Mladen had verified that it \nshould work now.\n\nI have VirtualHosts using mod_rewrite and mod_dav wit mod_jk2, and am willing \nto test if changes are made.  I'll reinstall both httpd and tomcat so that I \nbuild from source.", "id": 40577, "time": "2003-07-13T20:48:07Z", "creator": "noel@devtech.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-13T20:48:07Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "It seems fixed trying with.\nRewriteRule    ^/path1111(.*)$         /newpath/$1 [NC,L,R=permanent]\npath1111/foo.html - goes to /newpath/foo.html\npath1111/foo.jsp  - goes to /newpath/foo.jsp\n\n", "tags": [], "bug_id": 21549, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 53933, "time": "2004-03-12T15:36:43Z", "creator": "jfclere@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-12T15:36:43Z", "attachment_id": null}]
