I was not able to confirm the remaining ones and I suspect some false alarms.\n\nNote to reviewer: The diffs for Generator.java are quite hard to follow in the patch file, maybe it's easier for you to just remove the \"if (attrInfos != null)\" check yourself in the original code.", "id": 125917, "time": "2009-03-31T13:00:32Z", "bug_id": 46947, "creation_time": "2009-03-31T13:00:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 23432}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46947, "attachment_id": null, "text": "applied to trunk (tomcat7) - don't intend to cleanup tomcat6 (unless someone has the itch to reopen)\n\ncommit revision 832636", "id": 131655, "time": "2009-11-03T16:54:46Z", "creator": "funkman@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-11-03T16:54:46Z", "is_private": false}]
