The system on which the above components are installed is for web development, so they are contained in an environment on which Visual Studio 2008 is also installed.  The apache httpd process starts normally and seeminlgy serves pages pretty much as I expect, including pages containing PHP code.\n\nWhen I attempt to login to phpMyAdmin, immediately after I submit my username and passowrd, I get the following message from the Visual Studio JIT debugger:\n\nAn unhandled win32 exception occurred in httpd [3056]\n\nWhen I click on \"OK\" a new apache process spawns.  As before, the new process delivers pages as I'd expect, however, when I login to phpmyadmin, I get the above message again.\n\nI have enabled about as much logging as I can muster, and I'm surprised at the lack of detail I find.   The only information I see of any use is from apache, which seems to fail and restart a process. Nonetheless, I would not have expected the apache service to fail in this manner.\n\nWindows Event logs: no entries.\n\nPHP error log: no entries.\n\nApache error log:\n[Tue Jun 16 09:38:11 2009] [notice] Server built: Dec 10 2008 00:10:06\n[Tue Jun 16 09:38:11 2009] [notice] Parent: Created child process 1356\n[Tue Jun 16 09:38:11 2009] [notice] Child 1356: Child process is running\n[Tue Jun 16 09:38:11 2009] [info] Parent: Duplicating socket 200 and sending it to child process 1356\n[Tue Jun 16 09:38:11 2009] [notice] Child 1356: Acquired the start mutex.\n[Tue Jun 16 09:38:11 2009] [notice] Child 1356: Starting 64 worker threads.\n[Tue Jun 16 09:38:11 2009] [notice] Child 1356: Starting thread to listen on port 80.\n[Tue Jun 16 09:39:39 2009] [notice] Parent: Received shutdown signal -- Shutting down the server.\n[Tue Jun 16 09:39:39 2009] [notice] Child 1356: Exit event signaled.
