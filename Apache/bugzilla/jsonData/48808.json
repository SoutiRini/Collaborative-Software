[{"count": 0, "text": "This is an enhancement request for the mod_authz_owner module to support\nposix acls, enabling fine-grained, filesystem-based authorization.\nCurrently it only respects the primary owner and group of files.\n\nMany Unix-like systems support posix acls, including Linux, BSD and\nSolaris. OSX and Windows have similar features, but these might be more\ndifficult and/or less useful to interface with. Linux would be the\npreferred platform for a pilot implementation.\n\nFrom my perspective, the primary usecase is a file download system, where\nApache provides the HTTP access method in parallel with others, such as\nshell/ ssh/scp and Samba for CIFS/SMB, to access the same set of files.\nAuthentication is based on LDAP (both in Apache, Samba and nsswitch).\nCurrently, access control happens in three places: 1) Apache .htaccess\nand/or Directory/Location directives in the config, 2) Samba's additional\nuser/group directives in smb.conf, and 3) file/dir ownership. Keeping\nthe access control purely in the filesystem (with POSIX ACLs) would avoid\nthe fragmentation and difficulty of maintenance, as long as the access-\nproviding applications (Apache, Samba, etc) support it.", "bug_id": 48808, "attachment_id": null, "id": 134857, "time": "2010-02-24T12:21:51Z", "creator": "sveniu@opera.com", "creation_time": "2010-02-24T12:21:51Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
