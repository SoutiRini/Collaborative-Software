[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to upload some files to an existing directory to ensure that the \nnewest versions of the files are uploaded. I am using this command to do so:\n\n<ftp\n    server=\"${ftp.server}\"\n    userid=\"${ftp.userid}\"\n    password=\"${ftp.password}\"\n    remotedir=\"${ftp.remotedir}/${mirror.source.dir}\"\n    depends=\"yes\"\n    verbose=\"yes\">\n        <fileset dir=\"${share-root.dir}\">\n(...)\n        <include name=\"**\\\\*xml\" />\n(...)\n    </fileset>\n</ftp>\n\nEverything works fine, until a file in a subdirectory has a newer version. The \nftp task wants to upload this file but is convinced that it should first create \nthe directory. And than it fails because the directory already exists! Duh!\n\nSee log output:\n\n[ftp] checking date for WEB-INF/communitycfg.xml\n[ftp] transferring (...)\\WEB-INF\\communitycfg.xml\n[ftp] creating remote directory WEB-INF\n[ftp] disconnecting\n\nBUILD FAILED\nfile:(...)/build.xml:98: could not create directory: 550 Failed to create \ndirectory.\"(...)/WEB-INF\"\n\nNote: I left out some really long paths (...) because they are irrelevant here.\n\nDid I do something wrong here? Or has someone encoutered this problem before \nand has thought of a solution or workaround?\n\nthanks,\nMarten", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 16293, "id": 29780, "time": "2003-01-21T13:56:35Z", "creator": "mk@fundament.nl", "creation_time": "2003-01-21T13:56:35Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "stevel@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 29839, "time": "2003-01-22T07:05:38Z", "bug_id": 16293, "creation_time": "2003-01-22T07:05:38Z", "text": "what happens when you set ignoreNoncriticalErrors to true; it may just be your\nserver (wu-ftp ??) complaining."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "mk@fundament.nl", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi Steve,\n\nthanks you for this answer.
