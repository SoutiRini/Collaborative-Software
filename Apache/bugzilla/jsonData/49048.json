Create a directory in the IIS site with the same name as the redirect URL listed in the uriworkermap.properties, like manager.  Turn off anonymous access to the site to force basic authentication and apply ACL restrictions on the /manager site such that access is restricted.  \n\nResult:  The user is prompted for credentials but only parent directory permissions are applied, not the specific directories rights.
