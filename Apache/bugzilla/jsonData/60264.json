I really wish I could control file size and segregate tests across files by referencing one common library file. We can reuse modules within in a single file using module controllers, but we cannot do so across files.\n\nI'd love to have this setup.\n\nLibraries.jmx\n- Contains a thread with simple controllers containing HTTP samplers configured for the various API calls. For instance: CreateAccount, AddUser, etc...\n\nAccountTests.jmx\n- Contains test threads containing functional tests, which use modules controllers to reference the simple controllers in Libraries.jmx.\nUserTests.jmx\nLoadTests.jmx\netc...\n\nRight now they all need to be in one big file that take a long time to open and save.\n\nTest Fragments and Include Controllers don't meet this need.
