It has been a frustrating task, and I have\nnot yet achieved my objective. However, I have produced a fairly large\nchange that works - subject to some limitations. Further improvements are\nquite difficult for me because there isn't anything in the repository\nfor me to revert to!\n\nI would like to have my current set of changes committed to the repository.\nThey are intended to be transparent to anyone who doesn't use netbeans,\nand are optional for netbeans users.\n\nThe change comprises several parts:\n\n0. Netbeans reserves the subdirectory ${basedir}/nbproject for its\n   local files. A svn ignore for this directory was committed more than\n   a year ago, and is a pre-requisite for my change.\n\n1. In line with Konstantin's suggestions, I need a new directory\n   added to the source tree, called ${basedir}/res/ide-support/netbeans\n\n2. I need to make two neutral changes to build.xml:\n2.1. A new property that defines the invariant nbproject directory path.\n2.2. A set of netbeans-specific tasks to install the new res templates\n     into the local nbproject directory for an individual user.\n     (Analogous to the existing ide-eclipse target).\n\n3. A new collection of five template files to be committed to the\n   res/ide-support/netbeans directory. These files will be installed by\n   the new ide-netbeans build target.\n3.1. One of these files is a README which explains how to use the new\n     support, and its current limitations. I expect to replicate this\n     information into the appropriate section of the wiki.\n3.2. Project.xml \"wires\" the tomcat Free-Form project, associating\n     ide actions to ant targets, and also providing classpaths for\n     syntax checking and code completion.\n3.3. nb-tomcat.xml defines additional ant targets that are only applicable\n     to the netbeans workbench, such as debugging a single unit test\n     class.\n3.4. Two properties files, one relevant to both syntax-checking and ide\n     targets, and the other only relevant to the ide targets.\n\n4. Checkstyle passes all my changes, although I am not convinced that my\n   copyright notices are appropriate. However, checkstyle does not like\n   a file called nbproject/private/private.xml. This is created and\n   maintained by netbeans. I think there should be an exclusion rule for\n   checkstyle to ignore either the whole of nbproject, or at least\n   nbproject/private/*.\n\nI hope this proposed change is not too controversial."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "Brian@PingToo.com", "is_private": false, "id": 166905, "attachment_id": 30230, "bug_id": 54899, "creation_time": "2013-04-28T14:19:54Z", "time": "2013-04-28T14:19:54Z", "text": "Created attachment 30230\nNew file: res/ide-support/netbeans/README"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "Brian@PingToo.com", "is_private": false, "id": 166906, "attachment_id": 30231, "bug_id": 54899, "creation_time": "2013-04-28T14:20:37Z", "time": "2013-04-28T14:20:37Z", "text": "Created attachment 30231\nNew file: res/ide-support/netbeans/project.xml"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "Brian@PingToo.com", "is_private": false, "id": 166907, "attachment_id": 30232, "bug_id": 54899, "creation_time": "2013-04-28T14:21:10Z", "time": "2013-04-28T14:21:10Z", "text": "Created attachment 30232\nNew file: res/ide-support/netbeans/nb-tomcat.xml"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "Brian@PingToo.com", "attachment_id": 30233, "text": "Created attachment 30233\nNew file: res/ide-support/netbeans/nb-tomcat-project.properties", "id": 166908, "time": "2013-04-28T14:22:05Z", "bug_id": 54899, "creation_time": "2013-04-28T14:22:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "Created attachment 30234\nNew file: res/ide-support/netbeans/nb-tomcat-build.properties", "tags": [], "bug_id": 54899, "is_private": false, "count": 5, "id": 166909, "time": "2013-04-28T14:22:31Z", "creator": "Brian@PingToo.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-28T14:22:31Z", "attachment_id": 30234}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": 30229, "text": "Comment on attachment 30229\nsvn diff: changes to build.xml\n\nCorrect MIME type", "id": 167302, "time": "2013-05-20T09:22:02Z", "bug_id": 54899, "creation_time": "2013-05-20T09:22:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 167303, "attachment_id": 30230, "bug_id": 54899, "creation_time": "2013-05-20T09:24:41Z", "time": "2013-05-20T09:24:41Z", "text": "Comment on attachment 30230\nNew file: res/ide-support/netbeans/README\n\nFix MIME type"}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54899, "text": "Thanks for the patch.
