(I did a search on the archives\nand realised I am not the only one)\n\nLet me state my exact scenario in hopes that my added details will help.\n\nI use POI to create Excel spreadsheets with dynamic data using a template\n(.xls) file.\nPreviously, I was using and older version of POI [File size: 605 KB (620,262\nbytes)] which worked fine.\nHowever, I recently upgraded it to POI 2.5 Final, and it started having\nproblems.\nI been using the same test files for both versions (if anyone want a copy I\ncan send it to you).\n\nWhat happen is that there was a graphic in my excel which caused the\nproduced Excel file which could not be opened.\nAlso, there was NO exceptions/errors thrown from POI.\n\nLater when I read the below post, I tried to remove the graphic and 'viola'\nit worked correctly.\n\nHas anyone an idea why this is happening? Any quick remedies?\n\nMy system specs:\n----------------\nOS: Windows 2000 Server\nJRE: 1.4.1_02-b06\nExcel 2000 (9.0.2720)\n\n\nRegards,\nDaniel\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: mathieu . fretiere\nSubject: Unable to use a template (xls) file containing a wmf graphic\nDate: Thu, 04 Mar 2004 02:24:47 -0800\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\nHi,\n\nmy web application creates an Excel sheet with HSSF.\nIt reads first a template file (an xls file) containing a wmf (Windows\nMetafile) graphic.\nSometimes it works fine, if I use a plain wmf (or emf) graphic.\nBut if the wmf is more complex, Excel cannot read the generated file. This\nerror message appears in a pop-up : \"Impossible to read the file\".\nIt doesn't work either if I use a jpg or tiff graphic.\n\nWhere does this issue come from ?\nIs the wmf file too big ?\n\nFor information, I use :\n- Tomcat 4.1.18\n- Windows 2000\n- IE 6, Excel 2000\n\nthanks,\nMathieu", "id": 54636, "time": "2004-03-25T03:17:33Z", "creator": "daniel.joshua@gridnode.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-25T03:17:33Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "daniel.joshua@gridnode.com", "attachment_id": 11001, "text": "Created attachment 11001\nExcel file with graphic that caused the problem", "id": 54701, "time": "2004-03-26T03:20:42Z", "bug_id": 27933, "creation_time": "2004-03-26T03:20:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 27933, "text": "I added the Excel file I used for testing POI 2.5 Final as an attachment.\n\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=11001", "id": 54704, "time": "2004-03-26T03:40:51Z", "creator": "daniel.joshua@gridnode.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-26T03:40:51Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27933, "is_private": false, "text": "Works as of 12Jan2007, Testcase added. \nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41366", "id": 98102, "time": "2007-01-16T01:35:23Z", "creator": "avik@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-01-16T01:35:23Z", "attachment_id": null}]
