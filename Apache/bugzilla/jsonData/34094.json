Custom error\ndocument would not work in .htaccess or directory container.  (Custom 404 error\ndocuments with exactly the same details would work.) Only solution found to work\nwas to put entry in main confiuguration as for original error 500 report.\nrunning Server Version: Apache/2.0.52 (Fedora) Server Built: Nov 11 2004 10:31:42", "attachment_id": null, "id": 73202, "creation_time": "2005-04-02T06:43:34Z", "time": "2005-04-02T06:43:34Z", "creator": "stonemonkey@anodyneoz.com", "bug_id": 34094, "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34094, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Some errors are generated before the <Directory block or .htaccess files are\nread.
