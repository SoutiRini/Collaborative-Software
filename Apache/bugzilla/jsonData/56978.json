If the the junit task is configured with showoutput=\"true\", the test takes much longer (about 14x longer) to run on Windows only (the flag does not seem to significantly affect the speed of the test on our OSX or Linux nodes).\n\nInterestingly, setting printsummary=\"withOutAndErr\" and showoutput=\"false\" does not seem to slow the test down even though it's outputting about the same amount of text, so I don't think it's a problem with console or disk IO speeds.\n\nI've attached what my JUnit task looks like (note that it uses the fork option).\n\nThis is the performance I'm seeing on my Windows 7 machine:\n\n\nWith printsummary=\"withOutAndErr\" showoutput=\"false\":\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nTotal time: 1 minute 3 seconds\n\n\nWith printsummary=\"yes\" showoutput=\"true\":\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nTotal time: 14 minutes 30 seconds", "id": 177823, "time": "2014-09-12T17:46:07Z", "creator": "andy.ja.lee@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-09-12T17:46:07Z", "is_private": false}]
