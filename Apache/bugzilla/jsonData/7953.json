When I view the \nresulting source, it's all on one line, making it very difficult to read.\n\nAfter pouring through the jGuru faq and Tomcat docs, nothing helped. But \nI looked through the default web.xml file (in conf/web.xml), and came \nacross the comment describing \"mappedfile\". It implies that static content \nwill be output line-for-line. However, when I view the source, I get the \nsame thing.\n\nPerhaps IE can't deal with the line ending being sent. Perhaps that needs \nto be specifiable, too?\n\nTIA,", "id": 13229, "time": "2002-04-11T10:30:10Z", "creator": "rmann@latencyzero.com", "creation_time": "2002-04-11T10:30:10Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 13353, "time": "2002-04-12T12:13:25Z", "bug_id": 7953, "creation_time": "2002-04-12T12:13:25Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is already fixed and will appear in the next Tomcat 4.0.4 release.
