Please set the \"log4j-sysprop-name\" context\nparameter.\n\n\nI imagine this issue also applies to setting <Environment> and other elements\nsupported by ccf's as well.\n\nIs this expected behavior?  I can't imagine it is.  I sure didn't expect it and\nit makes it difficult to configure webapps and trust that they will continue to\nstay configured througout the entirety of their deployment whether they are\nreloaded or not.\n\nJake"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "No, you shouldn't assume anything, the JNDI resource are handled fine.
