I read an Excel file as a \ntemplate which also contins formulaes. Then I have to create around 15 Sheets \ndynamically for the report, in the same workbook.\n\nI create the first sheet successfully, and for the next on, I simply clone the \nfirst one. I found that if the first sheet contains formula, (in my case, it is \nsimple SUM() function ) it gives me a funny exception as \n\n-- java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Array index out of range: 0\n\nWhen I remove the formaulaes, it works fine !!! I also tried to enter the \nformulaes using cell.setCellFormula() method, but the exception occus again.\n\n\nCheers - Amol Athavale"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "avik@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 52118, "time": "2004-02-11T14:03:32Z", "bug_id": 26858, "creation_time": "2004-02-11T14:03:32Z", "tags": [], "text": "Seems like a valid bug, but I would request you to test this with 2.0 final and\nreport that result.
