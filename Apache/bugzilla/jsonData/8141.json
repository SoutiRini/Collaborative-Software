Reloading always gives the normal page back, but \nreloading again gives the 416 error back most of the time.  Turning off \nXBitHack in my config made this behavior go away.\n\nOk, here's where it started to get bizarre.  I was going to submit this report \nearlier today, but in testing it with netscape on a Solaris box, it wouldn't \nshow itself.  Then I tried with IE for Solaris, and it \"occasionally\" showed \nitself.  Then... Then I removed the user x bit from index.html, and the \nproblem went away.  Then I turned XBitHack back on, and the x bit on \nindex.html, and everything was -still- behaving correctly.  (?)\n\nHere's more of the weirdness.  The whole time, if I go to index.html directly, \nie:\nhttp://www.vorpalcloud.org:81/index.html\ninstead of\nhttp://www.vorpalcloud.org:81/\nit would also work fine, XBitHack or not.  (Note that port 80 is my \ncurrent 'production' apache 1.3.X server)\n\nAnyway, I still can't get the 416 error to resurface itself.  However, the \nserver side includes on the index.html page are not working if you don't go \ndirectly to index.html.  I'm not sure why it's not working with a \nDirectoryIndex style access to index.html, but it isn't.  So...  on a related \nnote (why I'm including it with this bug report)....\n\nWhen I go to http://www.vorpalcloud.org:81/gallery/ from IE under windows, it \ngives me the index.php script as is (doesn't actually run it), but if I go \ndirectly to it, it works just fine.  Likewise, from other browsers, it works \njust fine without going directly to index.php.\n\nI don't know, something weird seems to be happening with DirectoryIndex style \naccesses.  It's like it's handing me the pages just fine, but if it's not \nbothering to procss them at all."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8141, "text": "I believe this could be a similar bug to Bug 7966\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7966\n\nAt least the bit about your includes in your index.html\nfiles not working well unless you specify url/index.html,\nthat seems to be the same problem (and it's already been\nfixed)", "id": 15166, "time": "2002-04-30T18:14:24Z", "creator": "javier@guegue.com", "creation_time": "2002-04-30T18:14:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jerenkrantz@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 15169, "time": "2002-04-30T18:21:19Z", "bug_id": 8141, "creation_time": "2002-04-30T18:21:19Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Yeah, I agree - this looks like 7966 which has already been resolved.
