[{"text": "I've frequently compiled / installed Apache on plenty of different Hardware / OS\ncombinations and never come across this before, so I thought I'd sumbit it to\nhelp out, although I highly doubt it's a major issue.\n\nWhen running configure on an Apache 2.2.3 release, I decided (for the hell of\nit) to link it against my pre-installed PCRE library (in /usr/local, version\n6.7) and configure fails stating:\n\nconfigure: error: Size of \"void *\" is less than size of \"long\"\n\nWell, sadly, that's just not true.  On my architecture, a void pointer is 4\nbytes, and so is a long.  I've confirmed this just to make certain:\n\nenoch:~$ cat test.c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(){\n        printf(\"Sizeof void *: %d\\nSizeof long: %d\\n\",sizeof(void *), sizeof(long));\n        return 0;\n}\nenoch:~$ gcc -o test.run test.c\nenoch:~$ ./test.run\nSizeof void *: 4\nSizeof long: 4\n\n\nOkay, so that's that.  Take out the configure option \"--with-pcre=/usr/local\"\nand it configures, compiles and installs just fine.\n\nJust thought I'd let you know!", "tags": [], "creator": "untilzero@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 95588, "time": "2006-11-08T14:08:18Z", "bug_id": 40928, "creation_time": "2006-11-08T14:08:18Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 40928, "text": "Please attach the config.log produced when using the external PCRE.", "id": 95615, "time": "2006-11-09T02:11:49Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2006-11-09T02:11:49Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "untilzero@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 19105\nApache 2.2.3 config.log (--with-pcre)\n\nHere you go!", "id": 95622, "time": "2006-11-09T08:44:20Z", "bug_id": 40928, "creation_time": "2006-11-09T08:44:20Z", "attachment_id": 19105}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40928, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 95623, "time": "2006-11-09T08:55:45Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2006-11-09T08:55:45Z", "text": "The real error is:\n\n./conftest: error while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.0: cannot open\nshared object file: No such file or directory\n\nyou need to either add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf or set LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nor whatever, to allow the runtime linker to find PCRE."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "tom.lake@glossa.co.uk", "text": "This can happen if the PCRE library is not on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
