[{"text": "Created attachment 25012\nPatch to rotatelogs.c to add '-L filename' support.\n\nWith rotatelogs there's no simple way to determine which log file is current. The attached patch adds a -L option allowing you to specify a filename to be hardlinked from the current log file. E.g.:\n\n  rotatelogs -L /var/log/apache/access -l /var/log/apache/access 604800\n\narranges for /var/log/apache/access to always exist as a hardlink to the currently active version of access.nnnn. Now commands such as 'tail -F /var/log/apache/access' will work again.\n\nThe patch is simple, but assumes the presence of link(2). I see the APR trunk has added an apr_file_link() which would be a better solution.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 48761, "attachment_id": 25012, "count": 0, "id": 134615, "time": "2010-02-17T21:00:12Z", "creator": "lyndon@orthanc.ca", "creation_time": "2010-02-17T21:00:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 25023\nPatch against trunk\n\nI like this idea.
