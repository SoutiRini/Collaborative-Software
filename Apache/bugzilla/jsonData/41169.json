The NTEventLogAppender.dll did attempt to register itself \nto provide message resources for the event viewer, however it did not provide an absolute file path to \nthe DLL and used the wrong key types.  If the registry entries had been corrected, the previous DLL did \nnot expose the MESSAGETABLE resource despite it being present in the link step.  Combining the \nVERSION resource and the MESSAGETABLE resource into a single resource file before linking, fixed that \nproblem.  In addition, the category values used for the event logs were the int values of the level plus \none, for example, a INFO message would have a category of 10001, WARN would be 20001, etc.  This \nwould cause the category string lookup to fail since the specs say that categories should start at 1 and \nbe contiguous.\n\nIn addition, the log4j 1.2 branch did not have bug 39437 applied which eliminated unnecessary \nconversion back to the local code page.\n\nThe initial commits on the trunk in rev 487685 were misidentified as being related to bug 39437.\n\nThe new DLL's should be compatible with earlier versions of log4j.  When properly registered (by use, \ndoesn't support regsvr32 at this time), existing events should have properly displayed messages, but \nthe categories will still show the integer value of the level + 1.", "id": 96962, "time": "2006-12-15T14:52:12Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-12-15T14:52:12Z", "attachment_id": null}]
