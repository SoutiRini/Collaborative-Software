If you play a little bit with the scaling the borders are drawn \ndifferent but not at all. If the scaling factor is big enough the lines are \ndrawn correct. Somethin about > 230%\n\nThe weird thing is that if you use the debug action in the viewer that shows \nlines around everywhere, this lines are shown correctly no matter what scaling \nfactor is set.\n\nThe print is all fine its only a prob with the layout.\n\nSo its possible a bug in Java2d itsself perhaps with lines that are less a \npixel high. Could be somethin with thin line piplines and bufferedimage!?\n\nHere a link http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4109583 \n\nBy the way the pages in the AWTViewer are shown from biggest to smallest.\n(9...0) would be great to do it the other way around. =)"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 41918, "text": "resetting P1 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "id": 157298, "time": "2012-04-07T01:39:44Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:39:44Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
