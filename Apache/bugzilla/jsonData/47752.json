Instead of \"All Glyphs in the TTF files are not included\", do you mean that \"not all glyphs in the TTF files are converted\"?\n\n2. I imagine you are using the SVG font converter [2], did you look at the available command-line switches (\"l\", \"h\", \"ascii\")?\n\n3. Which glyphs were not included? Which command line did you use? What were you expecting? What would be \"include all glyphs\"? Etc.\n\n4. Just stating \"Arial.TTF\" is probably not enough. Adding which particular font version (can be found in font preview dialog) might help.\n\n5. Have you tried crawling through the mailing list? There are a few related posts [3] which might help.\n\n\nI'd say that, without further information, this seems more a support request (which belongs best to the mailing list) than a bug report.\n\n\n[1] http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html\n[2] http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/font-converter.html\n[3] http://www.nabble.com/Help%3A-SVG-Font-Converter-cannot-extract-from-TTF-td24542788.html", "id": 130023, "time": "2009-08-28T05:44:56Z", "bug_id": 47752, "creation_time": "2009-08-28T05:44:56Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": 24406, "bug_id": 47752, "text": "Created attachment 24406\nA test font to reproduce said issue", "id": 131300, "time": "2009-10-22T06:22:50Z", "creator": "xtassin@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-10-22T06:22:50Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "xtassin@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 24407, "id": 131303, "time": "2009-10-22T06:50:59Z", "bug_id": 47752, "creation_time": "2009-10-22T06:50:59Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 24407\nA test case to be used with Google Chrome\n\nDrop the test.html file in Google Chrome to see the missing glyph in action"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "xtassin@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 131304, "time": "2009-10-22T06:52:34Z", "bug_id": 47752, "creation_time": "2009-10-22T06:52:34Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Svg converted ttf fonts are often used for Google Chrome support of @font-face Css rule. HTML text using the svg font will display the <missing-glyph> (usually ugly little thing) when a Line-Feed character (U+000A) is met (in Windows).\n\nI have fixed this manually, so far, by adding the following glyph entry to my svg font files:\n\n<glyph unicode=\"&#x0a;\" glyph-name=\"uni000A\" horiz-adv-x=\"560\" />\n\nwhere the value of horiz-adv-x is equivalent to that of the \"space\" glyph. \n\nThe font then behave as ttf does (in Firefox by example) by representing the LF character a simple space.\n\nI am not sure, though, if this is acceptable both by SVG and Unicode standards.\n\nThis happened with every font I tested, with different range values and/or with setting the -autorange parameter.\n\nIs it an idea to automatically (or by command) add the LF glyph to the font?"}]
