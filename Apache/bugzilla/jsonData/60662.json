Whereas in XSLFSheet.importContent(), all the shapes are kept but just \"updated\", not removed and recreated.\n\nIs there a reason why the implementation of XSLFGroupShape.copy(source) is not the same as XSLFSheet.importContent():\nXSLFGroupShape gr = (XSLFGroupShape)src;\n\nList<XSLFShape> tgtShapes = getShapes();\nList<XSLFShape> srcShapes = gr.getShapes();\nfor(int i = 0; i < tgtShapes.size(); i++){\n    XSLFShape s1 = srcShapes.get(i);\n    XSLFShape s2 = tgtShapes.get(i);\n\n    s2.copy(s1);\n}\n\n\nIf I try to use this implementation all is working as expected.
