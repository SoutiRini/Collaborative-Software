I think mod_log_forensic could give me what I need, if only there were time stamps in the forensic log data.\n\nI tried piping the forensic log output to a filter program that prepended time stamps to each line of log data, but this didn't work because the log data was apparently being stdio-buffered as it left mod_log_forensic.  I can't think of any reason for buffering of the forensic log output as it's being piped into a filter, and I'd like to request that this buffering be turned off so that each line of log data goes immediately to the filter program.\n\nBetter yet, I'd like to propose that mod_log_forensic itself should be enhanced to include its own high-precision time stamps -- though I realize there might be resistance to doing this out of concerns for backward compatibility of the format."}]
