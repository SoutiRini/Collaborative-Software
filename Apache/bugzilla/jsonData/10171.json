[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 10171, "text": "For Tomcat4.0, I made the security zone(directories) using\nJDBC realm.When accessing the files in that zone by the \nInternet Explorer, MIME types of the embedded gif and jpeg \nfiles are not recognized by the browser.The property of those\nfiled is always bitmap (and 'unusable') and thus those files\ncan not be cached to the Temporary Internet Files directory.\n\nLooking at the log files, Tomcat4.0 always return 200 code \nwith the bit stream of the file.This means the browser can\nnot understand the MIME type the server sent. If once security\nrealm released, then the browser recognizes the Mime type and \nthus it caches.If again creating the security realm makes the \nbrowser send the information of the cache to the server. Thus,\nthe server returns 304 code to the browser and thus it recognizes \nMIME type.\n\nThere is no such problem in Netscape and there is no such \nproblem for Tomcat3.0,too.The OSs of Solaris,Windows NT and XP\nwere tested,resulting the same problem.This morning I tried \nTomcat4.13.But the same problem was observed.\n\nLooking forward to getting the implementer's reply, hopefully to my \nE-mail address koyama@itc.aist-nara.ac.jp,too.Thanks in advance.", "id": 18452, "time": "2002-06-24T10:05:31Z", "creator": "koyama@itc.aist-nara.ac.jp", "creation_time": "2002-06-24T10:05:31Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This has nothing to do with MIME types.
