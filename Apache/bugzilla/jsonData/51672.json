When I used SMTP appender then i noticed that it slows down the system. Its obvious because mail have to be sent. So another option is if we can have something like queued appender. Which will work as a proxy for appenders. In order to achieve the same I came up with this attached file. Kindly go through these and guide me.\n\nI sent mail to Curt Arnold and was guided to log a bug here. Marking as enhancement though.\n\nI do not mind to donate this piece of code to APACHE. In case any changes needed to be done, please guide me.\n\nThanks & regards\nAniruddha Dutta Chowdhury\n\nhttp://adchowdhury.blogspot.com/\nhttp://code.google.com/p/dotprojectdesktopclient/\nhttp://in.linkedin.com/in/adchowdhury"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 27398, "bug_id": 51672, "is_private": false, "id": 148668, "time": "2011-08-17T18:46:16Z", "creator": "a.d.chowdhury@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-08-17T18:46:16Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 27398\nsource code and sample log4j.properties file"}]
