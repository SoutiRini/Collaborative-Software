[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41101, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Starting with the 1.2 resolver.jar the CatalogResolver on \"resolve(String href,\nString base)\" creates a parser for the SAXSource in order to set itself as an\nentity resolver to it. Unfortunately there is no external access to set the\nparser's features. For example, running an XPath over files with xincluded\nfragments fails because the XInclude feature is not set to that particular parser.\n\nCould there be some API provided so that the parser features could be set\nexternally, or make creating the parser a protected method?\n\nThanks, Mircea.", "id": 96504, "time": "2006-12-04T00:15:23Z", "creator": "mircea@sync.ro", "creation_time": "2006-12-04T00:15:23Z", "is_private": false}]
