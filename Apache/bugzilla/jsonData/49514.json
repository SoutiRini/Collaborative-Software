A test case is as follows:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n\n<project name=\"bug-test\" default=\"test\" basedir=\".\">\n  <target name=\"test\">\n    <property name=\"foo\" value=\"bar\"/>\n    <echo file=\"test.properties\" message=\"foo=baz\"/>\n    <property file=\"test.properties\" prefix=\"old.\"/>\n    <fail message=\"Incorrect value for old.foo: got '${old.foo}', expected 'baz'\">\n      <condition><not><equals arg1=\"${old.foo}\" arg2=\"baz\"/></not></condition>\n    </fail>\n  </target>\n</project>\n\nThis test case succeeds with Ant 1.7.1, but fails with 1.8.0.\n\nWhile a partial workaround exists (don't define properties in your file that you'll import), this can pose problems when you attempt to load two different versions of a property file for comparison.  This comparison is useful if you're attempting to short-circuit an expensive action, based on metadata stored in the property file.", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49514, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This appears to be related to bug 40561, but the behavior was working as expected in a versions newer than 1.6.5.", "id": 137959, "time": "2010-06-28T19:27:13Z", "creator": "andrew.black@roguewave.com", "creation_time": "2010-06-28T19:27:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jglick@apache.org", "text": "Works in 1.7.1, 1.8.1, and 1.8.2 after the fix of bug #49373; only fails in 1.8.0.", "id": 137998, "time": "2010-06-29T12:39:01Z", "bug_id": 49514, "creation_time": "2010-06-29T12:39:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
