The patch enables a separate SSL Timeout using a directive: SSLTimeout with a value specified in seconds.  If the timeout is set the timeout for getting an initial ssl handshake is set separate from the general timeout.  This allows for configurations where more client latency is allowed for established ssl connections but not for initial session setup.  Patches are supplied for each branch."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "acoliver@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 25856\n2.2 branch", "id": 138952, "time": "2010-08-06T12:19:44Z", "bug_id": 49717, "creation_time": "2010-08-06T12:19:44Z", "attachment_id": 25856}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49717, "attachment_id": 25857, "id": 138953, "time": "2010-08-06T12:20:33Z", "creator": "acoliver@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-08-06T12:20:33Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 25857\n2.3 (trunk) branch"}]
