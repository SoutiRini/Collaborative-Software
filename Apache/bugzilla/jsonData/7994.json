It \nlooked like memory dumps here and there. In the Apache changelog I read this was a problem with \n1.3.22 and Windows XP networking. I upgraded to Apache 2.0.35. Html documents and pictures were \nserved OK. However, PHP generated documents returned the same garbage, only worst. Then I \ninstalled Apache 1.3.24 and everything is fine. Seems to me that CGIs on Apache 2.0.35 suffer from \nthe same problem as in Apache 1.3.22. I use the CGI version of PHP 4.10 btw, for *all* of the above \nsetups and the PHP configuration is identical. I searched on the PHP site for something similar \nbut nothing came up. \n\nI have both setups ready here in my Windows XP Pro box. If you would like me \nto give you any kind of source dump, I can do it for both versions (1.3.24 and 2.0.35)\n\nThank you \nfor your time and keep up the good work! :-)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Apparently you didn't stop to read this on you way to downloading 2.0.35...\n\n  \"Windows XP Apache Users Read This First\"\n  http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/#xpbug\n\nDo so.\n", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 7994, "id": 13310, "time": "2002-04-12T02:55:38Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-12T02:55:38Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7994, "is_private": false, "text": "It is incredible how much time and bandwidth can be spared with just a page-down and some RTFM...
