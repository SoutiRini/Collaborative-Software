From the POV of the revision controller, it's just a string\ncontaining some information about \"who\" or \"what\" did a check-in/check-out.\n\n> what do i do with it?\n\nAdd some info to the check-in/out entry about the person/machine/whatever which\nissued the operation.\n\n> why is it a magic string?\n\nIt's a remnant from the old ages when Lenya used strings for most\nparameterization tasks. It would be nice to replace it with an o.a.l.ac.Identity\nobject.\n\n> what does type refer to? org.apache.lenya.cms.rc.[ci|co]?\n\norg.apache.lenya.cms.rc.RCML.[ci|co]\n", "bug_id": 43017, "attachment_id": null, "id": 106237, "time": "2007-08-03T01:35:35Z", "creator": "andreas@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-08-03T01:35:35Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "text": "thanks for clarifying this. i've added some javadocs.", "bug_id": 43017, "attachment_id": null, "id": 106244, "time": "2007-08-03T02:03:55Z", "creator": "nettings@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-08-03T02:03:55Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
