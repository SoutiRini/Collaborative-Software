In the past the path was used and I found one error message still using path rather than name.\n\nThe documentation wasn't fully updated when parallel deployment was introduced. The short version is whenever the docs say \"path\" read \"path and optional version\" with the version being required if you want to refer to a web application that has been deployed with a version.\n\nI've updated the docs and error messages. The fixes will be in 9.0.0.M2 onwards, 8.0.31 onwards and 7.0.68 onwards. 6.0.x does not support parallel deployment.\n\n[1] http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/context.html#Naming"}]
