In\ndoing so, fmt:message (standard taglib 1.0.1) doesn't seem to work properly anymore.\n\nThe code I'm using is for error handling:\n\n<ul>\n<!-- <c:out value=\"${requestScope.com_mobiletxt_errors}\" /> -->\n<c:forEach var=\"err\" items=\"${requestScope.com_mobiletxt_errors}\">\n<li class=\"error\"><fmt:message key=\"${err.code}\" bundle=\"${syse}\">\n      <c:forEach var=\"arg\" items=\"${err.arguments}\">\n        <fmt:param><c:out value=\"${arg}\" /></fmt:param>\n      </c:forEach>\n    </fmt:message></li>\n</c:forEach>\n</ul>\n\ncom_mobiletxt_errors is a list of error objects.  Each error object contains a\ncode and an array of arguments.  The html output I get is below.  As you can see\nfrom the commented html, the code is the same for each error object in the list\nbut the arguments array is different for each one (as expected). \n\nHowever in the actual output of the fmt:message tag, it seems to use the first\nargument for each one.  I've tested this and if there were 10 errors in the\nlist, you would get 10 messages with that same first argument used (hope that\nmakes sense).\n\n<ul>\n\n<!-- [code=data.missing_value,args=[gateway], code=data.missing_value,args=[smsc\nID]] -->\n\n<li class=\"error\">gateway is a required value</li>\n\n<li class=\"error\">gateway is a required value</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\nAny ideas as to where the problem might lie?\n\nThanks,\nJason", "id": 24111, "time": "2002-10-08T02:17:29Z", "bug_id": 13394, "creation_time": "2002-10-08T02:17:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jan.luehe@sun.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Fix is available in nightly build and will be made available in upcoming\nstandard taglib 1.0.2 release.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 11204 ***", "id": 24162, "time": "2002-10-08T23:06:15Z", "bug_id": 13394, "creation_time": "2002-10-08T23:06:15Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the prompt response.
