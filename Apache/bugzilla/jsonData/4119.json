This functionality \nis currently available with the java task where I can use the jvm attribute to \nspecify the VM process name.\n\nOn openVMS javac is really called java$javac.exe in the same way that java is \nreally called java$java.exe. I specifically need to have the javac tasks forked \nbecause there appears to be a bug in the openVMS implementation of javac which \ncauses it to leak memory all over the place :(\n\nThe specific problem is being caused in \norg.apache.tools.ant.compilers.JavacExternal.java line 75 where the execute cmd \nis set to 'javac'.  \n\nFor the moment I intend to workaround the problem by implementing a custom \nCompilerAdapter which sets the javac proccess name correctly.", "id": 6610, "time": "2001-10-12T05:00:22Z", "creator": "samjoyce@iona.com", "creation_time": "2001-10-12T05:00:22Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4119, "text": "This should be possible in nightly build 2001-11-06.
