The legacy behavior ist left out right away.\nPlease see http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html#fcgidpassheader for more information.\n\nPatch is attached."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "thoughts here:\n\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/201408.mbox/%3CCAKUrXK56aNNFhKf7XCw0uENW1EVoXTmc2iC42r0NKcSXPv5r9A%40mail.gmail.com%3E\n\nfeel free to add", "id": 177200, "time": "2014-08-16T23:09:51Z", "bug_id": 56855, "creation_time": "2014-08-16T23:09:51Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56855, "attachment_id": null, "id": 179440, "time": "2014-12-02T12:23:57Z", "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-12-02T12:23:57Z", "is_private": false, "text": "A more global solution has been committed to httpd trunk (r1642847).
