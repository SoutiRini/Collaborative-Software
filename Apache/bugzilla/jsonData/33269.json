I have a module that uses\nap_document_root() and was surprised to find that it doesn't return the value\nconfigured with VirtualDocumentRoot.\n\nIf you don't feel this should be changed maybe you can at least advise me how to\ndo it myself. Since ap_document_root() is marked \"don't use this\" I suppose it's\nnot a good idea to just override conf->ap_document_root."}]
