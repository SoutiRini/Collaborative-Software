This is quite annoying to\nscroll up/down or collapse manually each node when working with heavy scenarios.\n\nI have some propositions to fix things which are not mutually exclusive:\n - add a new optional attribute in XML nodes to remember last state (collapsed\nor expanded) but this would imply mixing data and \"presentation\";\n - add a new option in preferences panel which specify what to do at file load :\nalways collapse all nodes, always fully expand, expand to level X (which would\nbe a spin edit) ... and a checkbox to specify if the file attribute (see the\nprevious point) has to be taken into account, or not;\n - add menu to manage the tree view providing entries like \"collapse all\",\n\"fully expand\", \"collapse this node\", etc.\n\nI hope this helps.", "id": 102342, "time": "2007-04-25T07:43:48Z", "creator": "michel.nolard@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-04-25T07:43:48Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42244, "attachment_id": null, "id": 102350, "time": "2007-04-25T08:15:00Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-04-25T08:15:00Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 42243 ***"}]
