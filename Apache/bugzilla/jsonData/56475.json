[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56475, "text": "The emerging consensus in the Web performance community is that TLS record size is an important factor for performance -- especially in HTTP/2 and SPDY, which are multiplexed.\n\nApache should make the record size configurable. Eventually, it'll probably be desirable to have it become dynamically tuned based upon connection status/parameters (e.g., in a module), but a static configuration directive would be a good first step.\n\nSee:\n  * https://istlsfastyet.com/#server-performance\n  * http://www.igvita.com/2013/10/24/optimizing-tls-record-size-and-buffering-latency/", "id": 174944, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "mnot@mnot.net", "creation_time": "2014-04-30T12:32:58Z", "time": "2014-04-30T12:32:58Z", "is_private": false}]
