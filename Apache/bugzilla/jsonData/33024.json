Fahrner Image Replacement is used for\ntab images, making it easier to \"skin\" Lenya's menus.\n\nThe attached file is a zipped representation of the webapps/lenya/lenya/\ndirectory, and should have the following structure:\n\nresources\n  css\n    menu.xml\n  menu\n    images\n      new\n        *.gif\n        nav\n          *.gif\nxslt\n  menu\n    *.xsl\n\nThe assumption here is that all files in this archive are to replace the\nexisting ones (sorry, I do not have Eclipse, so I could not create appropriate\npatch files).  The images were added in a new directory so as to not to\ninterfere with the old - I would assume if this enhancement is accepted, that\nthe images would move up one directory.\n\nSome things to note:\n1.  It is recommended that when using XHTML as the serializer, to have by\ndefault the XML prologue removed.  IE/Win would not like it.\n\n2.  The (ampersand)(pound sign)160; values in the i18n files be removed and\nreplaced with regular spaces, because in my experience when switching to XHTML\nserialization, accented A characters appear in their place.  The same goes for\nthe tabs and breadcrumb xsl files.\n\n3.  This update does not contain enhancements to the default xsl files for the\npublications, just the menus for Lenya.\n\n4.  This update is based on the official 1.2.1 release (Dec. 29, 2004).\n\n5.  Also note that no images for the CSS were created for the staging tab.  If\nthis needs creating, please let me know.\n\n6.  I have not fully tested this in IE/Win - it works perfectly in Firefox 1.0.\n\n7.
