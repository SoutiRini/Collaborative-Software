[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20868, "text": "I try to produce a Spare Parts List PDF with Apache FOP 0.20.5rc3a. On even \npages I just have a static explosion drawing and on odd pages a table with \nspare parts, that can spread over multiple pages. To do this I use repeatable-\npage-master-alternatives. To get nice page breaks, I have a pseudo region-body \nwith a height of 1mm on the even pages (the flow is the table, the explosion \ndrawing is on a static-content-area).\n\nUnfortunately I had to find out, that the external graphic on the static \ncontent area cannot be higher than the height of the region-body. Since I only \nhave a pseudo region-body of 1mm height, the image is rendered far too small ;)\n\nI do not think that this is desired behaviour. So I stepped into the source \ncode (I start to love open source).\n\nAnd in org.apache.fop.fo.flow.ExternalGraphic.layout(Area area) in line 209 I \nfound out that the maximum height of the external graphic is indeed dependent \non \"area.getPage().getBody().getMaxHeight()\". But this class is used for static \ncontent areas, too.\n\nI changed this to \"area.spaceLeft()\".\n\nFor my special rendering this works fine. Of course, I do not have a clue, if \nthis is a solution for any boundary condition.\n\nI would really appreciate if you could have a look at it.\n\nThanks,\n\nFloH", "id": 39024, "time": "2003-06-18T13:13:53Z", "creator": "fkunkel@web.de", "creation_time": "2003-06-18T13:13:53Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20868, "text": "Created attachment 6874\nProposed patch", "id": 39043, "time": "2003-06-18T17:05:38Z", "creator": "lmoore@providerlink.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-18T17:05:38Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 6874}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "lmoore@providerlink.com", "text": "Oops, ignore attachment.
