See the screenshot as \nattachment.\n\nI also wanted to see how the different load servers were doing, so the only \ncore change was to the SampleEvent class had to send the hostname it was \nrunning on back to the controller for each sample.\n\nThe visulaizer does not store each sample it receives, and thus the memory is \nnot growing at all, I have JConsole connected and after 3 days of continous \nrunning it was using only 32 MB memory. The graph only stores some limited \nnumber of values.\n\nThis visualizer requires some additional jars from JFreeChart and JNDC.\n\n-----------\nNew component classes in package: org.apache.jmeter.samplers\n------------------------------------------------------------\nStatisticalSampleSender - A new SamplerSender implementation, based on \nBatchSamplerSender.\nStatisticalSampleResult - A new SampleResult subclass\n\n\nChanged component classes in package: org.apache.jmeter.samplers\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSampleEvent - New field hostname\nSampleSenderFactory - New mode='Statistical' to chose the new \nStatisticalSampleSender\n\n\nNew visulaizer i n package se.six.jmeter.visualizers.statagg (should \npropablbly be refactored to org.apache.jmeter.visualizers.statagg.\n\nAll classes are new and not enumerated, these are all new additions that does \nnot affect any other visualizer.
