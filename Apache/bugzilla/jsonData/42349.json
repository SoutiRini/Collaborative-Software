[{"count": 0, "text": "The Load Balancing solution 1 \"DNS Round-Robin\" as detailed here:\n\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/rewriteguide.html\n\n... is against RFC 2181, which states:\n\n===\n10.1. CNAME resource records\n\n   The DNS CNAME (\"canonical name\") record exists to provide the\n   canonical name associated with an alias name.  There may be only one\n   such canonical name for any one alias.  That name should generally be\n   a name that exists elsewhere in the DNS, though there are some rare\n   applications for aliases with the accompanying canonical name\n   undefined in the DNS.  An alias name (label of a CNAME record) may,\n   if DNSSEC is in use, have SIG, NXT, and KEY RRs, but may have no\n   other data.  That is, for any label in the DNS (any domain name)\n   exactly one of the following is true:\n\n     + one CNAME record exists, optionally accompanied by SIG, NXT, and\n       KEY RRs,\n     + one or more records exist, none being CNAME records,\n     + the name exists, but has no associated RRs of any type,\n     + the name does not exist at all.\n===\n\nNote the section that says \"one\" CNAME record, which means \"not more than one\".\n\nFrom what I've been able to determine, there was multiple CNAME support in BIND\n4.x, however this was phased out (but still supported) in BIND 8.x, and has been\ncompletely removed from BIND 9.1+. Other name services may or may not support\nmultiple CNAME records, however it is not a reliable method of load balancing\nand should not be given as such in the documentation. At the very least the\ndocumentation should point out that this feature may not (and is unlikely to) be\nsupported by most DNS systems.", "bug_id": 42349, "is_private": false, "id": 102924, "time": "2007-05-07T22:30:28Z", "creator": "apache.org@moto-coda.org", "creation_time": "2007-05-07T22:30:28Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "attachment_id": 20342, "is_private": false, "id": 104379, "time": "2007-06-13T23:25:27Z", "bug_id": 42349, "creation_time": "2007-06-13T23:25:27Z", "text": "Created attachment 20342\nfor trunk"}, {"count": 2, "text": "Created attachment 20343\nfor trunk\n\nThere's no www6", "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "is_private": false, "id": 104380, "time": "2007-06-13T23:36:06Z", "bug_id": 42349, "creation_time": "2007-06-13T23:36:06Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 20343}, {"count": 3, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 23501 ***", "bug_id": 42349, "is_private": false, "id": 105077, "time": "2007-07-04T23:44:29Z", "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "creation_time": "2007-07-04T23:44:29Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
