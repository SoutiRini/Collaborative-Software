Something like:\n<VirtualHost *:443>\nAuthType Kerberos\n  <Location /xxx>\n    Require ldap-filter uid=*\n  </Location>\n  <Location /yyy>\n    Require ldap-filter &(o=something)(zz=value)\n  </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nWhen user fails to pass through \"require ldap-filter\" directive when accessing /yyy directory, he gets error 401.  In many browsers, it means that he is re-asked to type his name/password, even if he decides to go back to /xxx directory. So, I'd like mod_authz_ldap to return 403 instead of 401 in such cases.\n\nThere already was similar bug 40721 (I completely agree with you that 401 MUST be the default error code), but I propose to make things more flexible.\n\nThe attached patch adds AuthzLDAPUnauthorized directive, which is 401 by default, but may be set to 403 by user.\n\nIf you'd like it to have boolean switch (to avoid user setting AuthzLDAPUnauthorized to 200), feel free to ask me to rework my patch."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in 2.4 and later with AuthzSendForbiddenOnFailure", "attachment_id": null, "id": 172512, "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "time": "2014-01-19T20:41:59Z", "bug_id": 45674, "creation_time": "2014-01-19T20:41:59Z", "is_private": false}]
