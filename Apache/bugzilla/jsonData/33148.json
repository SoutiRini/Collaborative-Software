[{"text": "Hello,\n\nI'm using XIndice 1.1b4 (and tried it with current head, too) embedded within a \nwebapp in a Tomcat 5 on a jdk 1.4.2 windows system. \nOn startup of my application I initialize the database by creating several \ncollections and storing some data in them.\nThe problem is now that if I create a collection first, then create an index \n(or 4 indexes in my case) via the CollectionManager and then store some data \ninto that collection, the index is sometimes corrupt. The index is corrupt \nmeans that I can't search over that index and the index (*.idx) file on the \nfilesystem is only 57 bytes large.\nIf I let my system wait a couple of seconds before I start storing data it is \nall fine.\n\nBjoern Eickvonder", "tags": [], "bug_id": 33148, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 69799, "time": "2005-01-18T13:33:57Z", "creator": "b.eicki@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2005-01-18T13:33:57Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 19693\nindex.patch\n\nI think problem here happens when main thread tries to add documents to the\nindex file that hasn't been created yet by Timer thread.", "attachment_id": 19693, "bug_id": 33148, "id": 100238, "time": "2007-03-09T19:25:10Z", "creator": "nshilenkova@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-03-09T19:25:10Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "vgritsenko@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 100366, "time": "2007-03-13T20:22:25Z", "bug_id": 33148, "creation_time": "2007-03-13T20:22:25Z", "is_private": false, "text": "good catch. thanks for the patch, applied."}]
