This fills the log quickly, makes it hard to find serious messages in the log file and doesn't actually add usueful information.\n\nThe attached patch merges the problematic warn logging into the existing debug logging. The fact that merging is being done doesn't seem to warrant a warn message, since it is a supported feature documented by the component reference page.\n\nThanks for the good work on JMeter!", "count": 0, "id": 143790, "time": "2011-01-29T09:39:37Z", "bug_id": 50686, "creation_time": "2011-01-29T09:39:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50686, "text": "Thanks.
