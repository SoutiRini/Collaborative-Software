The output buffers are not flushed, so nothing is sent to the client.\nProbably happened also on older versions of Apache. With a test webserver and\nApache 1.3.27 on a PC not connected to any network (with 2 loopback IP\naddresses) flush seems to work. On other PCs with 1.3.27 and 1.3.29 nothing is\nflushed."}]
