[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56332, "text": "Certainty  \n\n\n \nUrl  http://apache.org/  \n\nVulnerability Details\n\nI have detected the TRACE/TRACK method is allowed. \nImpact\n\nIt is possible to bypass the HttpOnly cookie limitation and read the cookies in a cross-site scripting attack by using the TRACE/TRACK method within an XmlHttpRequest. This is not possible with modern browsers, so the vulnerability can only be used when targeting users with unpatched and old browsers. \n\nRemedy\n\nDisable this method in all production systems. Even though the application is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting, a debugging feature such as TRACE/TRACK should not be required in a production system and therefore should be disabled. \n\nExternal References\n\u2022Cross Site Tracing\n\u2022US-CERT VU#867593", "id": 174184, "time": "2014-03-31T06:14:43Z", "creator": "ashesh1708@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-03-31T06:14:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "text": "What is the bug in httpd?", "count": 1, "id": 174187, "time": "2014-03-31T19:00:59Z", "bug_id": 56332, "creation_time": "2014-03-31T19:00:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56332, "text": "This is not a httpd bug report.", "id": 174854, "time": "2014-04-24T17:52:22Z", "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "creation_time": "2014-04-24T17:52:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
