The attribute is a comma-separated list of regular expressions that will exclude files or directories under appBase from autoDepoy and deployOnStartup.  The host docs have been updated, and JMX get and set have been tested.\n\nWhy?  Here are a couple of use cases that this attribute can fix:\n\n- CATALINA_BASE configuration is kept under version control.  For example, I keep all of my configuration in subversion.  This includes appBase which has svn:externals to pull in the application code.  So, appBase/.svn gets deployed.\n\n- A context defined in server.xml but living in appBase will currently get double-deployed.  The recommendation is to move the app outside of appBase, but this attribute would allow it to live there with the instance's other apps."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50205, "attachment_id": 26251, "is_private": false, "id": 141357, "time": "2010-11-03T13:20:27Z", "creator": "jim@riggs.me", "creation_time": "2010-11-03T13:20:27Z", "text": "Created attachment 26251\ndeployIgnorePaths v1"}, {"attachment_id": 26258, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50205, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 141486, "time": "2010-11-05T11:10:13Z", "creator": "jim@riggs.me", "creation_time": "2010-11-05T11:10:13Z", "text": "Created attachment 26258\ndeployIgnorePaths-tc6 v1\n\n...and a backport for TC6."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in 7.0.x and included in 7.0.6\n\nProposed for 6.0.x\n\nI used a slightly different patch but it was heavily based on your work.
