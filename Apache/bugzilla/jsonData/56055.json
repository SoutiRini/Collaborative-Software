Tomcat adds the name of the Tomcat instance to the end of its session id cookie, separated with a dot (.) from the session id. Thus if the Apache web server finds a dot in the value of the stickyness cookie, it only uses the part behind the dot to search for the route.\"\n\nUnfortunately it seems me http 2.2 does not consider the value from the cookie at all unless it contains the dot. It's probably caused by this line: https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/2.2.x/modules/proxy/mod_proxy_balancer.c#L287\n\nIf *route does not contain a dot then the *route will be set to NULL, therefore the subsequent condition is false.", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "emdepl@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 176443, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 56055, "creation_time": "2014-07-16T22:36:18Z", "time": "2014-07-16T22:36:18Z", "text": "I could confirm this for 2.4.9 \n\nSupport for changing separator has been added in Bug 53893 (stickysessionsep parameter in mod_proxy).
