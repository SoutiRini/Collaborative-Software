They are created and maintained by Visual Studio.NET.\n\nI would like an Ant task to build using a .csproj file but *without* requiring\nVS.Net to be installed.\n\nWith this kind of task you can have the best of both worlds - VS.Net to manage\nyour C# project, and Ant to do the build, test, etc. And anyone can run this\n*without* having to have VS.Net installed - only the .Net framework would be\nrequired.\n\n!! I have a rudimentary version of this working if anyone is interested !!\n\nI achieved this by creating a Freemarker template to convert a .csproj file into\nan ant file (build.xml). It's not 100%, but it works great for my own simple\nprojects at least.\n\nIf anyone is interested I can send on what I have."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "stevel@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 42698, "time": "2003-08-13T19:23:53Z", "bug_id": 22389, "creation_time": "2003-08-13T19:23:53Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Stick what you have up as an attachment.
