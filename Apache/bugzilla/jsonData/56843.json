This causes that after setting up the certificate in httpd and loading the site too quickly a \"ocsp unknown status\" response is cached for the period of SSLStaplingResponseMaxAge (which is 2 days by default). Within this time span no access to the site is possible with OCSP stapling aware clients (restarting httpd doesn't help since the response is cached - the only way to fix this is to set SSLStaplingResponseMaxAge to a very low value, reload httpd, reset SSLStaplingResponseMaxAge to the old/default value and reload again).\n\nThere should be a more elegant way to fix this - e.g. by allowing a much shorter maximum caching age for \"unknown status\" responses.", "is_private": false}]
