I could not find any information on\nthis in any of the documentation or help references.\n\nThis is a problem for us when we have 2 (or more) projects which each need to be\npartially built in order for the other(s) to build as well.  Currently because\nno .class files are generated (even for .java files which have no imports and\ncompile fine alone) other projects which import these classes cannot compile\neither since the .class files they are looking for were not generated.\n\nSuggestions on a workaround would also be appreciated.
