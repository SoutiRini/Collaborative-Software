[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I built apache 2.2.17 [ubuntu 10.04] from source with intent to use:\n\n- MPM \"worker\" instead of \"prefork\", I used configure switches: --with-mpm=worker and --disable-prefork  \n\n- apache built-in ChrootDir directive\n\nAfter starting the httpd it seems the parent process starts ok but has problem to create the child processes. The child processes are in [httpd] <defunct> state, they go down and up, httpd does not serve any requests.\n\nI observed also the following:\n- When built apache with MPM prefork and used ChrootDir it works OK, all child processes operate OK in jail. Parent process is operating out of jail.\n- When build apache with MPM worker and did not use ChrootDir it works OK as well, the same way as with MPM prefork and ChrootDir\n\nMarcin", "attachment_id": null, "id": 144756, "creator": "gajowniczek_m@yahoo.com", "time": "2011-03-04T18:07:07Z", "bug_id": 50873, "creation_time": "2011-03-04T18:07:07Z", "is_private": false}]
