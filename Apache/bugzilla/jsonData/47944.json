It works for me with latest 6.0.x code.\n2. It looks the same as Bug 45953, that is already fixed in 6.0.20.\n\n3. Could you have provided a more simple JSP page that reproduces the issue? E.g. only with JSTL tags, without all those Faces, and with source code for the beans that were used? E.g., as a war file. I had to modify your page to be able to run it.\n4. The correct URL for JSTL Core tags would be \"http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core\". The one that you are using is for old JSTL 1.0. See the c.tld file. Of course, you app may be configured to accept both of them, but the new one is better.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 45953 ***"}]
