The Abstract class \nAbstractPSComment extended PSExtensionAttachment but didn't appear to be \nadding any value. PSCommentAfter and PSCommentBefore both extended it but the \nAbstract class had nothing more than the constructors. There is no code that \nworks with the Abstract class either, so it made sense to change \nPSCommentAfter & PSCommentBefore to extend PSExtensionAttachment directly.\n\nI then tested the patch using my local PS Printer (and Text Editor) and it \nworks great.
