She submits her credentials via an SSL-protected login \nform and finds herself at the \"role-protected\" resource that she originally \nrequested (which is also protected by SSL). Mary sees the SSL indicator in her \nbrowser and trusts that everything is secure. Unfortunately, it's not. For the \nduration of Mary's session, the hacker can use the session ID that he captured \nearlier to pose as Mary and benefit from all of her access rights.
