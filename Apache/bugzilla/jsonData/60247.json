[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "ysdev@tm-company.de", "text": "Apparently a \"Bug\" was fixed in 2.4 to omit 404 \"File not found\" from LogLevel Error and downgrade them to LogLevel Info [1].\n\nDiscussion leading up to the change: [2]\n\nThis change broke the documentation.\n\nThe ErrorLog directive [3] clearly contains an outdated example:\n\n  A typical log message follows:\n\n  [Fri Sep 09 10:42:29.902022 2011] [core:error] [pid 35708:tid 4328636416] [client 72.15.99.187] File does not exist: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/favicon.ico\n\nThe LogLevel shown in the example is now wrong, and with the default LogLevel of \"warn\", the message would never make it to the error log in the first place.\n\nThe LogLevel directive [4] does not mention which LogLevel is required in order to show \"File not found\" errors.\n\nDiscussion spawned by the lack of proper documentation: [5]\n\nThe documentation for both the ErrorLog and LogLevel directives should reflect the changed behavior, and should include an example on how to restore or approximate the previous behavior. I'm currently experimenting with:\n\nLogLevel warn core:info\n\nSo far it seems to work as intended, i.e. it works like 2.2 and prior versions did.\n\n[1] https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1180328\n[2] https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35768\n[3] http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html\n[4] http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#loglevel\n[5] http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/apache/dev/422757", "id": 194383, "time": "2016-10-12T22:28:06Z", "bug_id": 60247, "creation_time": "2016-10-12T22:28:06Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
