After several reboots and bouts of swearing later, I discovered that if I did not start my firewall, ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0.118 (installed and working fine for 3 months), there would be no blue screen.  To make sure I ran system without Apache started and ZoneAlarm running and there were no crashes, when Apache started blue screen would come back within the 9-10 minute range."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 10210, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 18539, "time": "2002-06-25T13:44:18Z", "creator": "thom@planetarytramp.net", "creation_time": "2002-06-25T13:44:18Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 7932 ***"}]
