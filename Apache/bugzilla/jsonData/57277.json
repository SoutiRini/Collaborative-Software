Some elements (e.g CSV dataset) allow the user of ~/ to include files relative to the script. Some listeners and processors and custom plugins either don't support this (e.g JRS223 post processor) or seem to interpret ~/ differently.\n\nSetting the property 'base.dir' as part of the FileServer would allow us to script relative paths for components that don't natively support them.", "id": 179340, "time": "2014-11-28T03:08:25Z", "creator": "cheyne.wilson@airnz.co.nz", "creation_time": "2014-11-28T03:08:25Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
