To put it short: a\nmemory problem (something in deallocated when it is still in use).\n\nSo the contents of files that behave strange is:\n--- Start File 'apache2ssibug.html' ---\n<html><head>\n<title>Apache 2 - SSI bug</title>\n</head><body>\n\n<p>So, lets include a file that will do printenv:</p>\n<!--#include virtual=\"apache2ssibug_printenv.html\"-->\n\n<p>Lets include it again (or any other file that does printenv and the same\nhappens also if you include any CGI script):</p>\n<!--#include virtual=\"apache2ssibug_printenv.html\"-->\n<!--ALSO BUG WITH #include virtual=\"/cgi/apache2ssibug.pl\"-->\n\n<hr />\n<p><b>And now we have:</b></p>\n<pre><!--#printenv --></pre>\n\n</body></html>\n--- End File 'apache2ssibug.html' ---\n\n--- Start File 'apache2ssibug_printenv.html' ---\n<pre><!--#printenv --></pre>\n--- End File 'apache2ssibug_printenv.html' ---\n\n--- Start File 'apache2ssibug.pl' ---\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\nprint \"Content-Type: text/html\\n\\n<p>Actually nothing here!</p>\\n\";\n--- End File 'apache2ssibug.pl' ---\n\nI haven't tryed to find a patch.
