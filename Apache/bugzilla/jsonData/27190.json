[{"text": "Hi,\n\nthere is a redirect problem with the COPY / MOVE request handling in the WebDAV\nservlet of\nTomcat.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nI created the webdav application with the following web.xml file in\nwebapps/webdav/WEB-INF:\n\n<!DOCTYPE web-app\n    PUBLIC \"-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN\"\n    \"http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd\">\n \n<web-app>\n \n  <servlet>\n    <servlet-name>webdav</servlet-name>\n    <servlet-class>org.apache.catalina.servlets.WebdavServlet</servlet-class>\n    <init-param>\n      <param-name>debug</param-name>\n      <param-value>10</param-value>\n    </init-param>\n    <init-param>\n      <param-name>listings</param-name>\n      <param-value>true</param-value>\n    </init-param>\n    <!-- Uncomment this to enable read and write access -->\n    <init-param>\n      <param-name>readonly</param-name>\n      <param-value>false</param-value>\n    </init-param>\n    <!--load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup-->\n  </servlet>\n  <servlet-mapping>\n    <servlet-name>webdav</servlet-name>\n    <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>\n  </servlet-mapping>\n\n</web-app>\n\nThe directory webapps/webdav/ is writable by the Tomcat jvm.\n\nI created the collection col  with cadaver (which worked fine).\n\nSo this is our starting point:\n\ndav:/webdav/> ls\nListing collection `/webdav/': succeeded.\nColl:  col                                     0  Jan  1  1970\n\nIf you try to move the collection col to col1 which results in the following request\n\nMOVE /webdav/col HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: neon/0.23.0 cadaver/0.20.5\nConnection: TE\nTE: trailers\nDestination: http://127.0.0.1:8080/webdav/col1\nOverwrite: T\n\nyou get a 302 as response:\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\nLocation: http://127.0.0.1:8080/webdav/col/\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nDate: Tue, 24 Feb 2004 13:37:41 GMT\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\n\nThe reason for this behaviour is caused by the fact that MOVE /webdav/col is used\ninstead of MOVE /webdav/col/.
