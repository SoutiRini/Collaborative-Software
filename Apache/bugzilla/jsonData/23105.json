Tomcat needs a way to find out this file.\nSo without putting the Context named like Alias inside Tomcat\nconfiguration it will have no idea where to look for that file.\n\nThe Alias is properly handled by mod_jk because the url with\n/test/index.jsp is requested from Tomcat. Of course it will return 404\nif have no idea what is the physical location of that files.\n\nThis will also not work neither with mod_proxy or mod_proxy_ajp because\nof the Tomcat nature, since the Tomcat is not PHP where you fed the\nphysical file location to its engine.\n\nAlthough if the Alias directory points to some directory inside Tomcat\nweb space, and in theory the physical location could be calculated\nthis still wont work in cases where you have a load balancer. In that\ncase one worker can be put on the same box as Apache, while other on a\nremote one.\n\nJK has been designed as proxy-kind-of-a-application, so its main\npurpose is to do a reverse proxying of requests to a Tomcat(s)\nand work on virtual url space, not on a physical one. Finding\nphysical location of requested uri is the Tomcat's job on the\nother end of the wire.\n"}]
