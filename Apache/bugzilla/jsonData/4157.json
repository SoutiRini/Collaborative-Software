At the command line, javadoc has the the\n\"-linkoffline\" flag, which allows tags like @see to link to existing\njavadoc.  In the command line version one could use something like:\n\njavadoc -linkoffline http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api . -d docs/\nsrc/Test.java\n\nwhere in the current directory there is a file called package-list with\none line \"java.lang\".  Any links to java.lang packages would then go to\nsun's site.  Obviously this is not idea, but may be an improvement on not\nhaving them resolved, and it would at least remove the build errors.  \n\nI'm assuming the functionality is also easily acheivable through ant's\njavadoc task.  People could then configure the offline link to their own\ncopy of the javadoc to save bandwidth (o:\n\nI'm not familiar with the build system atm, but imagine this would be easy\nto do.  If someone considers it worthwhile I'll happily do it and submit\nthe patch.\n\ncheers\ndim", "id": 6696, "time": "2001-10-14T19:07:01Z", "bug_id": 4157, "creation_time": "2001-10-14T19:07:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed.", "id": 8427, "time": "2001-11-29T09:34:58Z", "bug_id": 4157, "creation_time": "2001-11-29T09:34:58Z", "is_private": false}]
