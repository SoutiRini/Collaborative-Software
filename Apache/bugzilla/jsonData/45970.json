[{"count": 0, "text": "I am using HSSF api to automate our excel sheets which is really helpful. We are able to reduce lot of manual works due to the automation with help of HSSF api package. Thank you so much for contribution and I have one quick doubt on handling formula's which has ( sheet reference with http address). I tried to read and write formulas with sheet reference with http address. Looks like it's not supported. If it's supported, kindly request you to send me some sample/examples on how to do that.\n \n \nExample : my excel sheet cell has formula as :\n \n=('http://dummyurl/~qa/p4depot3/qa/main/doc/logan/QualityIndex/API_FVT/VC-ESX40/[VC40-ESX40-IndexRating_100608.xls]Summary'!$X$6)\n \nwhen I read it using \"Cell.getCellFormula()\" it returns the formula string as \"(QualityIndex!$X$6)\" where Quality Index is my excel sheet name.\n \nBut I don't see the way to convert the formula to the actual string which has HTTP value. Coz, I want to modify the http location file name and set the formula back.\n \nI couldn't read the formula and get the value 'http://dummyurl/~qa/p4depot3/qa/main/doc/logan/QualityIndex/API_FVT/VC-ESX40/[VC40-ESX40-IndexRating_100608.xls]Summary' \n \nas well if I try to write the above formula string using cell.setCellFormula (\"('http://dummyurl/~qa/p4depot3/qa/main/doc/logan/QualityIndex/API_FVT/VC-ESX40/[VC40-ESX40-IndexRating_100608.xls]Summary'!$X$6)\"); also didn't work out. \n \nPls let me know if this is a restriction with HSSF api or I need to use alternate api.\n \nThanks in Advance,\nKrishna.", "bug_id": 45970, "attachment_id": null, "id": 121330, "time": "2008-10-08T17:46:40Z", "creator": "dkk_sip@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2008-10-08T17:46:40Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 137354, "time": "2010-06-04T10:44:47Z", "bug_id": 45970, "creation_time": "2010-06-04T10:44:47Z", "text": "I've just tested this, and added a unit test for it (partly disabled)\n\nPOI can read URL-based formula references just fine.
