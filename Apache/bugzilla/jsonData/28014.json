Ant \"deploy\" task (even with \nattribute \"update=true\") does the following: first undeploy existing app, then \nupload new war (depending on connection, in my case, it can take up to 2 \nminutes), then deploy it. \n\nAll that time, while war file was uploading, webapplication was inaccessible, \nalso, if uploading failed for some reasons, webapp is left in undeployed state.\n\nSo, my suggestion is to change behaviour of manager \"deploy\" functionality in \nsuch a way, that war file first gets uploaded to the server, and only after \nthat the process of redeployment starts.", "is_private": false, "id": 54811, "creator": "vspa@mail.ru", "time": "2004-03-29T13:48:40Z", "bug_id": 28014, "creation_time": "2004-03-29T13:48:40Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28014, "attachment_id": null, "id": 54812, "time": "2004-03-29T13:52:44Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-03-29T13:52:44Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Well, sorry, but it won't be fixed.
