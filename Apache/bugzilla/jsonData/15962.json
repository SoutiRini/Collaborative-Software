Tomcat4's \"-p\" option applies the package name prefix, but creates \nall the jsps in the same package.  This leads to \"duplicate class\" problems if \ntwo jsps in different directories share the same name.\"\n\nI would also like to see this enhancement made to jspc.  Please see the above \nURL for a complete description of the problem and a proposed solution (source \ncode included).", "id": 29140, "time": "2003-01-10T18:05:11Z", "creator": "everett.toews@net-linx.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-10T18:05:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I think this is the default for the latest TC4.1.x and TC5", "attachment_id": null, "id": 35039, "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "time": "2003-04-11T23:27:01Z", "bug_id": 15962, "creation_time": "2003-04-11T23:27:01Z", "is_private": false}]
