Analysis of apr/config.log showed\n\n     gcc -o conftest.exe -g -O2 -DCYGWIN  conftest.c -lm -lcrypt >&5\n\nfollowed by gcc error messages reporting failure to find -lcrypt.\n\nlibcrypt is an optional component under cygwin and was not installed on my \nsystem -- installing it from cygwin setup fixes this problem and permits \ncompilation without serious issue :) Happily working system achieved.\n\nShouldn't configure test that -lcrypt is going to work before assuming that it \nwill? (Hence giving a helpful error message like \"You need libcrypt\" rather \nthan Shared Memory Allocation method could not be determined :)\n\n\nFYI, configure cmd line was:\n\n    ./configure --with-layout=Apache --enable-speling -enable-dav --enable-\nrewrite --enable-so"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Done on the trunk, thanks for the report.\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=239691&view=rev", "id": 78930, "time": "2005-08-24T17:29:50Z", "bug_id": 17232, "creation_time": "2005-08-24T17:29:50Z", "attachment_id": null}]
