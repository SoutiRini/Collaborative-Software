I am using Spring 3 MVC to build a java web app. When I deploy it on tomcat 7.0.57, I am able to search through umlauts in my app or rather I am able to receive it in controller as it is, but EURO '\u20ac' character is displayed as '\u00a4'. I am using ISO-8859-15 encoding.\n\nBut when I deploy same code in tomcat 8.0.18 (latest as of today), I am not able to get UMLAUTS characters but EURO '\u20ac' character is displayed as it is now. Though I have found workaround but I am curious about what is causing the issue. It will help me gain more knowledge about such behavior.\n\nI am not concerned about saving EURO as I have handled it after Controller class.\n\nThanks in advance!"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
