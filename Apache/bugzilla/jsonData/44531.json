Thing is the test case attached to this bug report uses a zero-width stroke, which intuitively would not scale (but I haven't double checked the specification regarding this; I'm not even sure if zero-width strokes should render...)."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "(Updating metadata to reflect a patch being available; Also, taking the opportunity to update a few bug properties.)", "is_private": false, "id": 128983, "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "time": "2009-07-19T16:00:20Z", "bug_id": 44531, "creation_time": "2009-07-19T16:00:20Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 44531, "is_private": false, "id": 129046, "time": "2009-07-22T07:32:22Z", "creator": "markus+asf@gyger.org", "creation_time": "2009-07-22T07:32:22Z", "tags": [], "text": "Thanks!"}]
