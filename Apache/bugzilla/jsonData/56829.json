I need a clean way how to get Tomcat scripts to start LiveRebel agent instead of Tomcat (the agent will be responsible for starting Tomcat).\n\nCurrently we are patching Tomcat scripts (catalina.sh/bat and setclasspath.sh/bat); however, that is messy, as every time user updates Tomcat, those changes get overwritten.\n\nInstead, I would like to change the \"java\" executable that Tomcat scripts use to start Tomcat.\n\nMy current solution is to set _RUNJAVA environment variable in CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh/bat and then patch CATALINA_HOME/bin/setclasspath.sh/bat not to override the setting if already set (see the attached patch).\nThis solution is also described here:\nhttp://zeroturnaround.com/forums/topic/trouble-setting-up-live-rebel-with-tomcat-on-ubuntu/#post-45253", "id": 177009, "time": "2014-08-08T11:45:10Z", "creator": "neeme.praks@eesti.ee", "creation_time": "2014-08-08T11:45:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 31888}, {"text": "Fixed in 8.0.x for 8.0.11 onwards and in 7.0.x for 7.0.56 onwards.\n\nI modified the patch slightly so setclasspath.sh handled java and jdb separately.\n\nThe modified patch has been proposed for 6.0.x.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 56829, "attachment_id": null, "count": 1, "id": 177090, "time": "2014-08-11T21:35:21Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-08-11T21:35:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56829, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This has been fixed in 6.0.x for 6.0.42 onwards.", "id": 178203, "time": "2014-09-30T13:32:32Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-09-30T13:32:32Z", "is_private": false}]
