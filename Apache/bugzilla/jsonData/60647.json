This is a bit of an odd place to fix up the connection count, but the ap_increment_counts is currently only called by the eor_bucket and I didn't want to put async vs. not async logic there."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 34678, "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 34678\nremove test val", "id": 196430, "time": "2017-01-25T21:56:20Z", "bug_id": 60647, "creation_time": "2017-01-25T21:56:20Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
