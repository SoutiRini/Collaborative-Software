[{"count": 0, "text": "Mentioned in bug #21296. Currently Project clones its listener list every time\nit fires something to a BuildListener - which can happen quite a lot, especially\nin an incremental build where no-op messages are flashing by.\n\nThis small patch should avoid any cloning except when getBuildListeners is\ncalled - currently only done by the <ant> task. Should be safe even in the\npresence of <parallel>, I think.\n\nNote that listeners are notified within the scope of the synch block, so they\nmay not e.g. call add/removeBuildListener themselves, or block on some other\nthread which might do so; not sure if this could be considered a problem or not.\nTo avoid that possibility, you would need to clone (or use toArray).\n\nAnyway, the patch is just for evaluation purposes.", "creator": "jesse.glick@netbeans.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 40004, "time": "2003-07-04T16:46:48Z", "bug_id": 21346, "creation_time": "2003-07-04T16:46:48Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 7105\nPossible patch", "bug_id": 21346, "attachment_id": 7105, "id": 40006, "time": "2003-07-04T16:48:15Z", "creator": "jesse.glick@netbeans.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-04T16:48:15Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "peterreilly@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 93924, "time": "2006-09-20T14:23:38Z", "bug_id": 21346, "creation_time": "2006-09-20T14:23:38Z", "text": "Just checked the current code, it does\nnot do cloning of listeners when firing\na log message. \n"}]
