[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2515, "text": "The move task, as it is now, copies the source file to the destination and then \ndeletes the source. \n\nTwo issues:\n\n1.  Copying is done even when the canonical file names are identical.  This \nmustn't be done.\n2.  Deletion is performed unconditionally resulting in deletion of the \ndestination file (which happens to be the same as the source, in this case).\n\nIn contrast, the copy task checks to see if the source and destination file \nnames are the same and then skips copying it if they are.  \n\nThe Move task should either skip over the file quietly (as Ren does in Windows) \nor fail out saying the source and destination files are identical (as mv does \nin Unix)\n\nI am marking it as a minor issue as I don't think users would be performing \nmoves where the source and destination are the same.  But still, users will be  \nusers...\n\nSample:\n\nAssuming file f1 is already in /export/home/mumasank, execution of the \nfollowing task results in f1 being deleted.\n\n   <target name=\"move2samefile\">\n      <move file=\"f1\" tofile=\"../../home/mumasank/f1\"/>\n   </target>\n\nMagesh", "count": 0, "id": 3506, "time": "2001-07-09T07:49:13Z", "creator": "umagesh@rediffmail.com", "creation_time": "2001-07-09T07:49:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 299\nChecks to see if file names are identical, skips if they are.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 2515, "id": 3507, "time": "2001-07-09T07:57:32Z", "creator": "umagesh@rediffmail.com", "creation_time": "2001-07-09T07:57:32Z", "attachment_id": 299}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2515, "attachment_id": null, "id": 4316, "time": "2001-08-06T23:57:33Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-08-06T23:57:33Z", "is_private": false, "text": "fixed in nightly build 2001-08-08"}]
