This not an issue, JMeter try several ways to find the keytool util. \nThe error message just say that JMeter don't find keytool util from PATH environment variable.\nAfter JMeter finally found keytool from JAVA_HOME variable, so the keystore can be generated with success.\n\nSo JMeter 3.2 despite the -not-error message will work correctly on your machine.\n\nI've change this message from the level ERROR to INFO to avoid this (false) error message (and move the stacktrace into DEBUG level).\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1792359&view=rev\nLog:\nCannot run program \"keytool\": CreateProcess error=2 when starting JMeter 3.2 in gui mode\nChange level (from ERROR to INFO) of the exception message when JMeter try to find the keytool util from PATH env var.
