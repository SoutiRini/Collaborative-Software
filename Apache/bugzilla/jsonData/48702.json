AFAIK, the rasterizer uses the rendering hints specified by content [1].\n\n\n> The rasterizer should have options that allow setting the rendering hints to\n> use.

As I've stated within the same thread [2], the idea was to allow these rendering hints to *override* the hints already provided by the content (even if not specified, the lacuna values will be used, so this is implicit).\n\nProviding a mechanism to override the rendering hints, possibly through the proposed presets would then be cool to allow optimizing for a few use-cases (somehow already stated [2] also):\n * Batch or high volume conversion, where speed could be required/desirable over quality;\n * Printing, where optimal quality would be highly desired given the usually high resolution available in most output devices;\n * Etc..\n\n\nI've rephrased the bug's summary to reflect this clarification. :-)\n\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#RenderingProperties\n[2] http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-batik-users/201002.mbox/%3C2a1ddf8a1002071046t499e6580i66c8bc9e8a1dbd23@mail.gmail.com%3E"}]
