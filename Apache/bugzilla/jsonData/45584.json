The documentation to mod_authnz_ldap module tells me that \"LDAP attributes specified in the AuthLDAPUrl directive are placed in environment variables with the prefix \"AUTHENTICATE_\"\".  However, I get no AUTHENTICATE_ variables -- they are set only when checking LDAP password, and it is not my case.\n\nI think it is very useful to get AUTHENTICATE_* variables available for CGI scripts even then ldap is used as authorization module and does not authenticate user.\n\nThe attached patch works for me, but it is obviously wrong (for example, it sets AUTHENTICATE_* variable twice if ldap is used for both authorization and authentication)."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "magne.andreassen@arm.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 24156\nSet environment variables when only using LDAP authorization.\n\nAlternative patch for setting the AUTHENTICATE_ variables when only doing LDAP authorization.
