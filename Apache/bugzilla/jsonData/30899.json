Not tried with\nanother applications.\nThe problem was consistent and I tried different machines to see if it was\nspecific to one machine. But the problem reproduced on two different machines.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Clean installation of Tomcat 5.0.27\n2. Download ActiveBpel (http://www.activebpel.org/) and run it's install script\n(May be replaced by any other application that may force creation of a <app>.xml\nin the conf\\catalina\\localhost subdirectory. )\n3. Restart tomcat and try to access any of the app pages.\n4. Notice that the xmls created in the conf\\catalina\\localhost subdirectory are\nactually *directory* rather than *files*.\n\nThe problem doesn't crop up on using version 5.0.25."}, {"count": 1, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 29688 ***", "bug_id": 30899, "is_private": false, "id": 62597, "time": "2004-08-27T16:38:25Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2004-08-27T16:38:25Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "bossy@indiainfo.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 62600, "time": "2004-08-27T16:49:35Z", "bug_id": 30899, "creation_time": "2004-08-27T16:49:35Z", "text": "oops.\nSorry for the hasty bug filing.\nFigured out that it's a repeat of bug 30875."}]
