[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Some errors that happen during the execution of a test, only shows up as \"ERROR\"\nlines in the jmeter log file.\nSo these errors go unattended by a lot of users, I think.\n\nI suggest to add a short text, displaying the number of errors logged in the\njmeter log file, if possible in only the number of errors in the current test\nexectuion.\n\nCurrently, in the upper right corner, there is a text showing the number of\nthreads running. This seems to be kind of a \"status\" line. Perhaps we could add\na text there, stating  : \"Number of errors logged : 3, number of threads running\n5/10\".\nThis would make it quite easy to see if anything unexpected has happened in the\ntest execution.\n\nI am not sure if we should look at the jmeter log file, or if we should set up\nour own log listener, which only receives \"ERRORS\" for all classes. I guess it\nwould be best to set up our own log listener, because some users might set the\njmeter properties so that nothing is logged.\n\nIt would also be nice to have an action or menu item to show the error log,\neither the jmeter log file, like the bugzilla 41788 talks about, or just the\nerrors our own log listener has received.\n\nI think this functionality would be very useful. If someone has better\nsuggestions on where to display the information, that is fine. But I think it\nshould always be displayed, so that even novice users will be able to notice it\nwithout having to set something up first.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 104938, "creator": "alf@i100.no", "time": "2007-06-30T02:56:03Z", "bug_id": 42784, "creation_time": "2007-06-30T02:56:03Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42784, "attachment_id": null, "id": 104950, "time": "2007-06-30T08:26:29Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-06-30T08:26:29Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Sounds like a good idea, but would need to be carefully implemented to avoid \ncausing too much overhead.
