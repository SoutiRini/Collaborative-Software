But I alos found more than a handful of people \nwho got severe problems getting the jk 1.2.18 to run.\nWe got a win2k3 server system with a IIS6. In the moment, one web runs with \nthe jk 1.2.14 and works fine. It's configured via the registry:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Apache Software Foundation\\Jakarta Isapi \nRedirector\\1.0]\n\"log_file\"=\"D:\\\\LOGFILES\\\\jk1\\\\JK1.2.1x_isapi.log\"\n\"log_level\"=\"info\"\n\"worker_file\"=\"D:\\\\Java\\\\Jakarta\\\\jk1\\\\conf\\\\workers.properties\"\n\"worker_mount_file\"=\"D:\\\\Java\\\\Jakarta\\\\jk1\\\\conf\\\\uriworkermap.properties\"\n\"extension_uri\"=\"/jakarta/isapi_redirect.dll\"\n\nso when we take that working config, and just swap the binary \nisapi_redirect.dll (1.2.14->1.2.18), it won't start.\nThe ISAPI FILTER for the web is marked red, Status: not loaded, Priority \nunknown (yes, I tried to use the web first), and in the eventlog of the \nmachine, there is an event 2214 from W3SVC-WP, type error:\n\nThe HTTP Filter DLL D:\\Java\\Jakarta\\jk1\\bin\\isapi_redirect.dll failed to \nload.  The data is the error.\nData: 0000: 02 00 00 00\n\nThere is no JK log or anything else I could think of I could provide here.\nBut feel free to ask for more information. Please help, because we need the \n1.2.18. he 1.2.14 is not too stable in heavy load environments."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bjoern@syltonline.de", "attachment_id": 18783, "text": "Created attachment 18783\nour uriworkermap.properties", "id": 92859, "time": "2006-09-01T08:33:58Z", "bug_id": 40384, "creation_time": "2006-09-01T08:33:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 18784\nour workers.properties", "attachment_id": 18784, "id": 92860, "creator": "bjoern@syltonline.de", "time": "2006-09-01T08:34:25Z", "bug_id": 40384, "creation_time": "2006-09-01T08:34:25Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "This is already fixed in the SVN.\nAs a workaround add rewrite_map_file registry entry that points to\nthe empty file.\n\nBTW, this was already explained both on tomcat dev and users list see:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/users@tomcat.apache.org/msg15849.html", "is_private": false, "id": 92861, "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "time": "2006-09-01T08:39:53Z", "bug_id": 40384, "creation_time": "2006-09-01T08:39:53Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "TYPO: Its a rewrite_rule_file, not rewrite_map_file!\n", "attachment_id": null, "id": 92862, "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "time": "2006-09-01T08:41:24Z", "bug_id": 40384, "creation_time": "2006-09-01T08:41:24Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "bjoern@syltonline.de", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks al lot Mladen Turk, that was quick.
