Attached is the template version that is modified and causes the error. Notice that the very first column is not empty and is supposed to have output written to it... When there is a blank column \"A\", and the output is written from column \"B\", the error does not result. \n\nI was able to get around this issue by changing the template file format to .xls instead of .xlsx... Many times if the error was not caught, the .xsls report would need to be \"repaired\" before opening. When I looked into this further, it seems as though the XML tags for the sheet are being generated out of order.\n\nEx:\n<row r=\"14\" ht=\"15.75\" customHeight=\"true\">\n...\n</row>\n<row r=\"15\" ht=\"15.75\" customHeight=\"true\">\n...\n</row>\n<row r=\"19\">\n...\n</row>\n<row r=\"16\" ht=\"15.75\" customHeight=\"true\">\n...\n</row>\n<row r=\"18\" ht=\"15.75\" customHeight=\"true\">\n...\n</row>\n<row r=\"17\" ht=\"15.75\" customHeight=\"true\">\n...\n</row>\n<row r=\"20\" ht=\"15.75\" customHeight=\"true\">\n...\n</row>\n<row r=\"21\" ht=\"15.75\" customHeight=\"true\">\n...\n</row>\n\nWhen the report generated had less than 200 rows, I was able to \"repair\" and open the report but rows would be removed from my results. When more data was to be returned, the XmlValueDisconnectException would result and report generation would fail.", "id": 187898, "time": "2016-01-22T13:01:27Z", "creator": "brendan.buzaid@kronos.com", "creation_time": "2016-01-22T13:01:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 33478}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 58910, "text": "This bug seems similar to https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49940\nbut when I tried the latest version of POI the issue still remained...", "id": 187899, "time": "2016-01-22T13:02:47Z", "creator": "brendan.buzaid@kronos.com", "creation_time": "2016-01-22T13:02:47Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"text": "You will need to provide some code-sample that shows how you reproduce the problem.
