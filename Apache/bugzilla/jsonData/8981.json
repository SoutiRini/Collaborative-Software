Yes, I agree that this could be done, but there are situations where this is\nnot pratical, or efficient.  Example: Suppose you have an existing directory\nstructure containing many files, and you have a tar file which might contain\nsome of the same files and some new files.  Suppose you would like to know the\ncontents of the tar file.  If you untar the file, you will not be able to tell\nwhich files came from the tar, and which files were preexisting, or both.\nA nice feature would be to have the ability to do the equivilant of the tar\ncommand: \"tar -tvf tarfile.tar\" or \"tar -tf tarfile.tar\".  I would like to be\nable to make the table of contents available.\n\n\n2. In version 1.4.1, if I use this:\n<tar tarfile=\"${build.dir}/listfile.tar\" basedir=\"${src.dir}\"\nincludesfile=\"listfile.txt\" />\nwhere \"listfile.txt\" is contained in the basedir, and the file contains\nfilenames separated by newlines, it will tar all of the files from the list.\nThe problem is, in my case the basedir will be the root directory, so I need to\nbe able to include the list of fully qualified paths of files to be included in\nthe tar file.\n", "id": 15949, "time": "2002-05-11T16:39:27Z", "creator": "donkeeting@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2002-05-11T16:39:27Z", "is_private": false}]
