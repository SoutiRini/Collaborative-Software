With a properly generated ClassFileset, the normal dependency checking\nof the jar task would be available.\n\nIt also seems much cleaner to not have a special genjar task to create a\n\"linked\" jar file, given that this seems naturally to just be a special fileset.\nMaybe the only stretch is a fileset could then also represent a set of files\ncontained in a jar or zip file."}]
