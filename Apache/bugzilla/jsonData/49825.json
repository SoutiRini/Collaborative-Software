I think this is wrong for several reasons:\n\n1, Apache's current behavior is pretty much guaranteed to not be the behavior the client needs or expects; if I'm attempting to patch the middle of a file, I don't want the server to replace the entire file with the patch and then report success.\n\n2, although comments in mod_dav.c indicate that the behavior is motivated by RFC2616 [14.16], the relevant paragraph says: \"The recipient of an invalid byte-content-range-spec MUST ignore it and any content transferred along with it.\" In other words, the server is required *not to use* the request entity-body if it is accompanied by an unparsable Content-Range header.\n\nI think that both RFC2616 and common sense indicate that if dav_parse_range() cannot parse a Content-Range header, Apache should reject the entire request (presumably with an HTTP 400 error code)."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49825, "attachment_id": null, "id": 139483, "time": "2010-08-25T21:16:26Z", "creator": "wiml@omnigroup.com", "creation_time": "2010-08-25T21:16:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "(Possibly related: bug 42978)"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in trunk in r1026743", "attachment_id": null, "id": 140964, "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "time": "2010-10-24T05:05:35Z", "bug_id": 49825, "creation_time": "2010-10-24T05:05:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49825, "attachment_id": null, "id": 144043, "time": "2011-02-08T06:44:32Z", "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-02-08T06:44:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Backported to 2.2.x as r1068309."}]
