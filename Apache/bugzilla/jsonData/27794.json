[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Team, \n\nThe following patch merges the LayoutProcessor interface back into the \nLayoutManager interface, which returns the meaning of the latter into being the \nminimal interface that a LayoutManager must implement in the LayoutManager \nlayout strategy.  (Similar to the Renderer interface in the render packages.)  \nThis change is primarily to simplify the Layout code.\n\nKeiron separated the two last year in order for their to be more freedom in \nlayout strategies, but this is before Victor already gave us the LayoutStrategy \ninterfaces, which does much the same thing (except doesn't limit you to \nLayoutManager classes at all.)  Keeping separate interfaces isn't buying us \nanything at this time--rather, we can free up the LayoutManager design by \nreducing the number of methods within it.  (So far, though, that hasn't been a \nconcern.)\n\nPeter, would implementing this change have any affect on your Alt-Design and \nits possible integration in HEAD?  I don't think it will, and it will make \nthings easier in HEAD.\n\nI'll wait three days, and if no objections, apply this on Sunday (Wash DC time).\n\nThanks,\nGlen", "attachment_id": null, "id": 54250, "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "time": "2004-03-19T04:01:07Z", "bug_id": 27794, "creation_time": "2004-03-19T04:01:07Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27794, "attachment_id": 10864, "id": 54251, "time": "2004-03-19T04:02:30Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-19T04:02:30Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 10864\npatch (also need to drop LayoutProcessor.java)"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27794, "attachment_id": null, "id": 54332, "time": "2004-03-21T12:01:41Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-21T12:01:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Applied."}, {"count": 3, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 155865, "time": "2012-04-01T06:45:26Z", "bug_id": 27794, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:45:26Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
