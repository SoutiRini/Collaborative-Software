First I called ant -verbose to verify that the options were not being generated in the Javadoc command-line when I enabled the use of my doclet. Since it wasn't generating the command-line correctly, I looked at the source code and found in Javadoc.execute() that the lines for generating those options only execute \"if (author && doclet == null)\" and \"if (version && doclet == null)\", respectively. Why is this done this way? Unless there is some other rationale for this that I'm missing, it seems to me to be a bug."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "conor@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "It is done this way because these options are actually options of the standard \ndoclet and not supported by every doclet.\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/javadoc.html#standard\n\n", "id": 6869, "time": "2001-10-18T21:13:26Z", "bug_id": 4283, "creation_time": "2001-10-18T21:13:26Z", "is_private": false}]
