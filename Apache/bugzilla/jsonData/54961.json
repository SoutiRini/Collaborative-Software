It's not easy to deploy APR in different System.\n\nSo we are tring to make NPN running in Load Balancer and Tomcat 8 only takes the role of pure SPDY server.\n\nHere is the detail of this model.\n\nhttp://www.igvita.com/2012/10/31/simple-spdy-and-npn-negotiation-with-haproxy/\n\nHAProxy takes the role of Load Balancer and it supports NPN.\n\n\nHAProxy talks with SPDY server in \"compress\" mode.\nHowever the \"compress\" mode can't be configurable in SpdyProxyProtocol.\n\nSo I suggest let's make it configurable.\n\nAttached a patch for this enhancment."}, {"attachment_id": 30282, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54961, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 167188, "time": "2013-05-14T07:00:32Z", "creator": "xshao@ebay.com", "creation_time": "2013-05-14T07:00:32Z", "text": "Created attachment 30282\nPatch for SpdyProxyProtocol"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54961, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 167456, "time": "2013-05-28T11:42:10Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-05-28T11:42:10Z", "text": "Thanks for the patch.
