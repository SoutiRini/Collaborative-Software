The short of it is that I'm occasionally seeing Apache using nearly 100% CPU while running in foward proxy mode.  I have made several backtraces at short intervals if anyone would like to see them. strace shows nothing interesting but I did notice that the number of threads seems to vary wildly within the high-utilization process. This is not the case in a normal Apache process.\n\nAnyway, I would really appreciate some help with this issue. Even some reasonable advice as to what I can do to debug this myself would be great. That said, please keep in mind that I'm running in a production environment so the amount of \"expensive\" debugging that I can do is limited.\n\nThanks again in advance for your help.", "id": 114041, "time": "2008-02-27T03:33:04Z", "creator": "pbelau1@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2008-02-27T03:33:04Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44496, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Any difference from Bug 44381 ?", "id": 114047, "time": "2008-02-27T04:58:06Z", "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "creation_time": "2008-02-27T04:58:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44496, "text": "Please do not open a new report but follow up the old one (44381) instead.
