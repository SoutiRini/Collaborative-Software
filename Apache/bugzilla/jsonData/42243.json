This is quite annoying to\nscroll up/down or collapse manually each node when working with heavy scenarios.\n\nI have some propositions to fix things which are not mutually exclusive:\n - add a new optional attribute in XML nodes to remember last state (collapsed\nor expanded) but this would imply mixing data and \"presentation\";\n - add a new option in preferences panel which specify what to do at file load :\nalways collapse all nodes, always fully expand, expand to level X (which would\nbe a spin edit) ... and a checkbox to specify if the file attribute (see the\nprevious point) has to be taken into account, or not;\n - add menu to manage the tree view providing entries like \"collapse all\",\n\"fully expand\", \"collapse this node\", etc.\n\nI hope this helps."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42243, "is_private": false, "id": 102351, "creation_time": "2007-04-25T08:15:00Z", "time": "2007-04-25T08:15:00Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "*** Bug 42244 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42243, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 102700, "time": "2007-04-30T15:45:32Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-04-30T15:45:32Z", "text": "If you don't want the tree expanded, set the following entry in \njmeter.properties:\n\nonload.expandtree=false"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42243, "attachment_id": 20805, "is_private": false, "id": 108104, "time": "2007-09-13T00:52:55Z", "creator": "christoph.schragen@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2007-09-13T00:52:55Z", "text": "Created attachment 20805\npatch for new menu items \"collapse\" and \"expand\"\n\nbefore release 2.3 (before new property onload.expandtree), we fixed this\nbehaviour by creating 2 new menu items in the \"edit\" menu (and context menu\nwhen right clicking on a treenode)\n- collapse all nodes\n- expand all nodes\nnodes are recursively collapses/expanded beginning from the selected node.\nwe are working with this feature since 2 months and it works fine. \ni created a patch for release 2.3, it would be nice if this feature can be\nfound in next release :)\n\ncheers,\n  chris"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42243, "attachment_id": null, "id": 111152, "time": "2007-11-27T09:48:26Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-11-27T09:48:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Added to SVN in r597885.\n\nDid not use your code (sorry, overlooked the Bugzilla issue)"}]
