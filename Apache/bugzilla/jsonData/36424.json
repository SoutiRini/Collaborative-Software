At this point, I'm not sure if this is even a bug in Apache \nor a problem with my conf file settings.\n\nAs there is a manual work around (cumbersome tho it may be), I have lowered \nthe priority of this report.  But I would appreciate any advice or pointers \nwhen you can, even other bug reports of similar nature.  I'd like to add an \nattachment with the current configuration file, but don't see how to do that \nhere.

I don't \nreally apply patched to source.  I only support binary rpm kits.\n\nAnd thanks for the extremely quick reply, Andre.  I've scanned the RH forums \nas well, but will go back to look again more deeply.  SELinux is included in \nthis system, so I'll check this out.  Shells... maybe; I believe startup is in \nSH and BASH thereafter.  All of the httpd scripts have the usual #!/bin/bash \nat the top, so it \"should\" be running under bash in either scenario.  It's \nworth a second (actually 19th) look again at that.\n_______\nMike P\n\n", "id": 79197, "time": "2005-08-30T18:18:44Z", "bug_id": 36424, "creation_time": "2005-08-30T18:18:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36424, "is_private": false, "count": 4, "id": 80681, "time": "2005-10-02T18:07:52Z", "creator": "globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2005-10-02T18:07:52Z", "text": "Resolved.\nSELinux placed unexpected attributes on files copied from a PC into SAMBA \nenvironment that are incompatable with APACHE.
