If this is the case then, there should be a clear separator between the first row and the following rows as one (like myself) would assume that they are summaries of the columns below. But they are not. \n\ne.g. Look at the \"Statistics\" table above. The totals row (first row) are totals of the columns below them. In the table \"Top 5 Errors by sampler\" this is obviously not the case as you kindly mentioned.\n\nI now understand how this table works. However, to make it more understandable I would suggest the following:\n\n1. Remove the 1st row of the table \"Top 5 Errors by sampler\" named \"Total\" as this shows exactly the same as the table above it.\n\n2. Add the \"total\" row to the top of the table \"Errors\"\n\nSee screenshot", "id": 197861, "time": "2017-03-21T11:20:13Z", "bug_id": 60840, "creation_time": "2017-03-21T11:20:13Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60840, "attachment_id": 34857, "id": 197862, "time": "2017-03-21T11:21:49Z", "creator": "alexander.barker@interactivedata.com", "creation_time": "2017-03-21T11:21:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 34857\nMove the totals row to the errors table to avoid confusion/cleaner dashboard."}]
