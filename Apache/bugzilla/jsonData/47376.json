We turned on the debug mode and please find the debug info and stack in the attachment. If the debug mode is turned off then there will be an report about \"Singal (6) Abort\" in the log.\n\nIt could not be reproducible and it usually happened 1-2 minutes after the clock hour, like 15:01, 03:02 or 17:01, so we are not sure if it is related to the log rotate process.\n\nWe have searched the mod_ssl and openssl CHANGES as well as previous bugs and could not find any clue for this. So we just raised it as new.\n\nFrom the log, it seems that the openssl did some double free pointer at some point. \n\nAny information about how to potentially fix it or what to do to narrow it down would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nAndy", "id": 127987, "time": "2009-06-16T11:56:36Z", "bug_id": 47376, "creation_time": "2009-06-16T11:56:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47376, "attachment_id": 23818, "id": 127988, "time": "2009-06-16T11:58:37Z", "creator": "ypwangreg@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-06-16T11:58:37Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 23818\nstack trace on debug mode"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47376, "attachment_id": null, "id": 137440, "creation_time": "2010-06-08T08:13:07Z", "time": "2010-06-08T08:13:07Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "text": "Is this reproducible with current versions of OpenSSL and httpd 2.2.15?", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47376, "text": "No response in 4 mos, marking as cannot reproduce.", "id": 140529, "time": "2010-10-06T19:09:57Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-06T19:09:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
