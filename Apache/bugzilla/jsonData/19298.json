Another symptom of\nthis same problem is requesting /foo.jsp where foo.jsp doesn't exist.  Apache\nshould be the one returning a 404, not tomcat.\n\nI want Apache to be the one deciding what should be handled when I am using its\nconfiguration directives.  Using Location-style directives is a horrible idea\nfor such things as it is a security issue when you have various names that can\nrefer to the same file, eg. Windows.  As the Apache documentation clearly\nstates, Location directives should not be used to control access to files on\ndisk but should only be used for true virtual namespaces."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This reads like an enhancement request to me.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 55787, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "time": "2004-04-14T20:48:01Z", "bug_id": 19298, "creation_time": "2004-04-14T20:48:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "I'm also seeing this problem.  \nIs there any idea on when this will be added/corrected?  \nHow about any CVS code that resolves the problem? \n \nThanks ", "attachment_id": null, "id": 57115, "creator": "simpsonb@hillsboroughcounty.org", "time": "2004-05-10T16:42:45Z", "bug_id": 19298, "creation_time": "2004-05-10T16:42:45Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "ivanfm@users.sourceforge.net", "attachment_id": null, "text": "same problem here", "id": 58667, "time": "2004-06-03T21:25:49Z", "bug_id": 19298, "creation_time": "2004-06-03T21:25:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "This enhancement request has been transferred to Tomcat 5 because:\n- TC4 and TC5 share the connectors\n- TC4 is no longer being developed, only supported", "id": 59564, "time": "2004-06-19T11:47:27Z", "bug_id": 19298, "creation_time": "2004-06-19T11:47:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19298, "text": "As of November 15, 2004, JK2 is no longer supported.
