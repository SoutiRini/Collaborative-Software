Active MQ web interface shows that 1 message has been de-queued but I am unable to confirm it from Jmeter. The \"listner\" I am using is \"View Results Tree\".\n\nLittle background, I have an application(say, app 1) which queues a request in Active MQ. Another application(say, app 2) which has subscribed to that topic de-queues it. Now, I want to validate that app 1 has queued correct request with correct content. The only way I could think is to capture the it in JMS Subscriber.\n\nI have used Jmeter earlier to send SOAP requests and the same listner would work perfect showing complete recevied response from the application.\n\nIs there some problem in JMS sampler or am I using incorrect methods?\n\nI hope I was clear in mentioning my case.\nPlease let me know in case of any confusion.\n\nRegards,\nGunjan"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 50180, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.\n\nPlease subscribe to the JMeter user list and post the question there.\n\nMake sure you are using JMeter 2.4 (the current version) first.", "id": 141155, "time": "2010-10-29T07:47:42Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-29T07:47:42Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50180, "text": "Hey, your issue may be related to \nhttps://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52034", "id": 150592, "time": "2011-10-14T21:17:58Z", "creator": "slavko_h@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-14T21:17:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
