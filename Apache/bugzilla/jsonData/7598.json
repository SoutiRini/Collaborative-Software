This file ain't there for 4.0.3 or 4.0.2 and I'm \nnot sure about 4.0.1.\n\nI did find it under 4.0  final but I had to look under some rocks to get that.\n\nIn my travels I noticed that the Connectors are not consistently available \nacross the multiple releases that are out there. \n\nIt sure would be nice if someone fixed this so that you used the same build \nscript more than once. \n\n\nThanx a bunch.
