If you still haven't resolved the issue, can you try setting the loglevel to debug (https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#loglevel) to see the result of this log?\n\n    /* establish a connection to the OCSP responder */\n    ap_log_cerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_DEBUG, 0, c, APLOGNO(01973)\n                  \"connecting to %s '%s'\",\n                  proxy_uri ? \"proxy\" : \"OCSP responder\",\n                  uri->hostinfo);\n\n\nAs far as I can see the cafe.ro should be resolved, and in case of failure you should have found an error like the following in your logs:\n\n    if (rv) {\n        ap_log_cerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, rv, c, APLOGNO(01972)\n                      \"could not resolve address of %s %s\",\n                      proxy_uri ? \"proxy\" : \"OCSP responder\",\n                      next_hop_uri->hostinfo);\n        return NULL;\n\n\nAre you sure that cafe.ro is correctly resolving to 127.0.0.1 on your system?"}]
