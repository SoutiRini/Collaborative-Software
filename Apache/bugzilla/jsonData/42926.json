[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "According to Tomcat's documentation, the standard manager implementation\n(StandardManager) serializes session data on Tomcat shutdown and deserializes\nthe data on Tomcat startup. This works fine. The documentation also states that\nthe same should happen when a context is reloaded. The standard session file is\n\"SESSIONS.ser\" in the context's work directory.\n\nWhen a context is reloaded, however, Tomcat serializes the session data\ncorrectly, but since the session data file is in the work directory by default\nand tomcat deletes that directory's contents on context reloading, the session\ndata file is deleted and cannot be found when it's time to deserialize the\nsession data. Therefore upon context reloading, all sessions are gone. I don't\nexpect this to be a wanted behavior (at least this would require an explicit\nnotice in the documentation).\n\nA quick workaround is to specify a session file path outside the work directory.\n Perhaps by default, the session file should be stored outside the work\ndirectory by default or the file should not be deleted upon context reloading.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 42926, "id": 105739, "time": "2007-07-18T02:25:36Z", "creator": "thomas@schuerger.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-18T02:25:36Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This works for me using the manager and the latest 5.5.x code.
