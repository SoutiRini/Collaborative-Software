If one is found us it, it many then use a configuration property\n    For every child of the parent node, call this policy to name children of this node\n\nIf you're interested we can contribute a patch\n\nLet us know your thoughts.\n\nThank you", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 60514, "id": 195622, "time": "2016-12-22T20:45:46Z", "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "creation_time": "2016-12-22T20:45:46Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "text": "Created attachment 34550\nStep 1", "id": 195623, "time": "2016-12-22T20:46:14Z", "bug_id": 60514, "creation_time": "2016-12-22T20:46:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 34550}, {"count": 2, "text": "Created attachment 34551\nStep 2", "bug_id": 60514, "attachment_id": 34551, "id": 195624, "time": "2016-12-22T20:46:51Z", "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "creation_time": "2016-12-22T20:46:51Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60514, "attachment_id": 34552, "text": "Created attachment 34552\nStep 3 (result)", "id": 195625, "time": "2016-12-22T20:47:13Z", "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "creation_time": "2016-12-22T20:47:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60514, "attachment_id": 34621, "text": "Created attachment 34621\nPatch implementing the feature enhanced with elements discussed on dev mailing list with Antonio", "id": 196073, "time": "2017-01-15T13:51:35Z", "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "creation_time": "2017-01-15T13:51:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "text": "Author: pmouawad\nDate: Mon Jan 16 20:18:54 2017\nNew Revision: 1779101\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1779101&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 60514 - Ability to apply a naming convention on Children of a Transaction Controller\nContributed by UbikLoadPack\nBugzilla Id: 60514\n\nAdded:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/ApplyNamingConvention.java   (with props)\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/TreeNodeNamingPolicy.java   (with props)\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/impl/\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/impl/DefaultTreeNodeNamingPolicy.java   (with props)\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/GuiPackage.java\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/ActionNames.java\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/AddToTree.java\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/util/MenuFactory.java\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/resources/messages.properties\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/resources/messages_fr.properties\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 196108, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 60514, "creation_time": "2017-01-16T20:21:01Z", "time": "2017-01-16T20:21:01Z", "is_private": false}]
