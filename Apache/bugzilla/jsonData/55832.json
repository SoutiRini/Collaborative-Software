However, apr_strnatcmp() handles characters as \"char *\" and it causes inappropriate behavior. This is a example.\n\n// \"\\xE3\\x81\\x82\" == \"\u3042\" is a basic Japanese character in UTF-8\nstrcmp(\"a\", \"\\xE3\\x81\\x82\") => -1\napr_strnatcmp(\"a\", \"\\xE3\\x81\\x82\") => 1\n\nIt makes a sort result strainge.\nCan anyone merge this patch?"}]
