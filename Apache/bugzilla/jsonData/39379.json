Including\nfonts.\n\n> Emded cnf Font are not supported.\n\n   CNF fonts are not supported, embeded or otherwise.  SVG, TrueType,\nand apparently under JDK 1.5 Type 1 fonts _are_ supported.  If Adobe\ndidn't use such an proprietary format for font embedding this wouldn't\nbe a problem.\n\n> The warper for URLs is filled with wrong data from somewhere while Loading \n> from the SVGDOMImplementation.getDOMImplementation()\n\n   I'm not sure what I'm supposed to see in this.  The problem is \nthat we just don't support CNF fonts, I don't see this changing any\ntime soon."}]
