There are \ntypically two number formats that we are supposed to be using \n\nFirst is the US format of 999,999,999.99 and the second is Italian number \nformat of 999.999.999,99 . The difference between the two formats is swapped \nusage of a dot and a comma.\n\n\nThe regular expression that we are using for the US format is ^(\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})\n*)?(\\.\\d{1,2})?$\n\nThe regular expression that we are using for the Italian format is  ^(\\d{1,3}\n(.\\d{3})*)?(\\,\\d{1,2})?$\n\nAgain swapped places of Dot and comma\n\nNow when I pass 2.222.222 to the US format regular expression, it returns a \nfalse (which is expected )\n\nBut when I pass 2,222,222 to the Italian format regular expression, it returns \na true and the validation passes( unexpected ). I would think that since the \ncode base is the same for the \u201cMatch\u201d method, it should behave the same but it \ndoes not. \n\nI ratified that it is not our code which is causing the issue by using this \napplet available on the Apache website . \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/applet.html  \n\nI hope I am not bothering you too much and any help on this will be greatly \nappreciated !", "id": 97612, "time": "2007-01-03T18:13:23Z", "creator": "rochak.sethi@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-01-03T18:13:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41287, "attachment_id": null, "id": 97647, "time": "2007-01-04T09:16:17Z", "creator": "bayard@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-01-04T09:16:17Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Looking at your regexp for the Italian version, it contains '.' and not '\\.', so\nanything will match there. ie:\n\n^(\\d{1,3}(.\\d{3})*)?(\\,\\d{1,2})?$\n\nto\n\n^(\\d{1,3}(\\.\\d{3})*)?(\\,\\d{1,2})?$"}]
