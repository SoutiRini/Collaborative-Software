Then t2 goes ahead and it can hit the same method call too since\nthe entry.manifest is still not null at that time. And then t2 or t1 continues\nand loads the class and sets entry.manifest at the end. After this, when the\nother thread tries to finish the call to definePackage, an exception will be\nthrown since entry.manifest and entry.codebase have become null now.\n\nI haven't got any good solution so far.

In revision 510801 the synchronisation was changed to synchronise the outer block on \"this\", with no synchronisation on \"entry\".  The problem seems to me to be that although \"entry\" is a local variable, the object it references is obtained externally so two different threads are able to access the same object, and thus one thread is able to set entry.codeBase to null (at line 1853 in 5.5.23) after the other thread has entered the block and committed itself to calling pkg.isSealed(entry.codeBase).\n\n> The best place to get help on this is the users list.
