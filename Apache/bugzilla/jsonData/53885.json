[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "In below documentation of JUnit and task there is an option to set maxmemory attribute. This attribute sets xmx memory to specified value ex. -Xmx1024m is set when I set maxmemory=\"1024m\"\n\nhttp://ant.apache.org/manual//Tasks/junit.html\n\nI would like to have an option to set via similar attribute max perm gen pool size  (for example named maxpermmemory) ex.  -XX:MaxPermSize=512m is set when i set maxpermmemory=\"512m\"\n\nI have a complicated situation on Team City where i am using ant to run a lot of slow tests with code coverage. I am getting perm gen and really need such option. \n\nThere is no option to set forkmode to create for every test separate VM (that would eliminate my problem) because those tests would take ages (one run about 4 days ;/)\n\nThis is very easy enhancement I think.
