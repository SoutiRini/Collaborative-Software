As if it was defined relative to the selected cell.\n\nUsing the recipe  in the quick guide\nhttp://poi.apache.org/spreadsheet/quick-guide.html#NamedRanges\ndoesn't work. It creates a reference as \"sheetname!A1:A1\".\n\nWhen creating a named cell in Excel, the reference is absolute, i.e. sheet!$A$0\n\nIdeally, I'd wish an idiom such as:\ncell.setFormulaText(CellReference(name));\nwould work.\n\nI created two Gists that demostrate the problem:\nThis doesn't work with the desired idiom and the cookbook solution:\nhttps://gist.github.com/dschien/6001876\n\nThis works (explicitly makes the ref absolute by inserting the '$' signs):\nhttps://gist.github.com/dschien/6001918\n\nThanks,\nDan", "id": 168609, "time": "2013-07-15T17:53:41Z", "creator": "dance@web.de", "creation_time": "2013-07-15T17:53:41Z", "is_private": false}]
