[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60873, "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to build Apache httpd server 2.4.25 on Ubuntu 4.8.0.\nThe idea is to embed httpd server into own application and to be able\nto install on target machine in any location in file system.\nI found the tool build/binbuild.sh which should do exactly\nwhat I want.\nAfter I run binbuild.sh I get an archive\nhttpd-2.4.25-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.\nThen I unpack it and run install-bindist.sh <target dir> to deploy httpd.\n\nThe only problem I see is the issue with httpd.conf file. After I run\ninstall-bindist.sh, I see empty conf/httpd.conf file (and\nempty conf/httpd-std.conf) in target directory.\n\nI started to search what is wrong, and found that binbuild.sh raises\nthis error at the end:\n-------------\n[EOF]\nBinary image successfully created...\nServer version: Apache/2.4.25 (Unix)\nServer built:   Mar  9 2017 08:24:50\nCreating supplementary files...\nsed: can't read bindist/conf/httpd-std.conf: No such file or directory\nCreating distribution archive and readme file...\n-------------\n\nInside binbuild.sh I see these lines:\n-------------\nchmod 755 install-bindist.sh\n\nsed -e \"s%$BUILD_DIR%$DEFAULT_DIR%\" \\\n    -e \"s%^ServerAdmin.*%ServerAdmin you@your.address%\" \\\n    -e \"s%#ServerName.*%#ServerName localhost%\" \\\n    bindist/conf/httpd-std.conf > bindist/conf/httpd.conf\ncp bindist/conf/httpd.conf bindist/conf/httpd-std.conf\n-------------\n\nHowever I can't find httpd-std.conf.\nAs I can see in httpd source code (FishEye), this files was deleted\nmore than 10 years ago. As well as httpd-std.conf.in\n\nI suppose the fix is simple, just fix the name and path like this:\n...\n    bindist/conf/original/httpd.conf > bindist/conf/httpd.conf\ncp bindist/conf/httpd.conf bindist/conf/original/httpd.conf\n...", "id": 197708, "time": "2017-03-16T08:47:50Z", "creator": "mshaydulin@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-03-16T08:47:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
