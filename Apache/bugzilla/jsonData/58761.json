I've attached a very small patch to this email generated from svn diff (as stated in https://httpd.apache.org/dev/patches.html) against the last commit of the trunk branch. I've also followed http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/docsformat.html for the build/validation steps.\n\nI believe that this patch should be good for trunk and 2.4.X (backported).\n\nIf you like the idea I would be available to start reviewing all the developer docs to add more info and update dead/broken links (possibly asking you more questions of the IRC channel). I would really love to start contributing to the httpd project and this might be a good starting point. Please also let me know if you have ideas about areas that are not covered well enough, I could add more sections as well (for example: how mpm_event works, what resources must be read before submitting code, etc...)\n\nLet me know!\n\nLuca", "id": 187090, "time": "2015-12-22T15:30:53Z", "creator": "toscano.luca@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-12-22T15:30:53Z", "attachment_id": 33369}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "text": "applies to trunk and 2.4.x, thanks for the improvements.", "id": 187184, "time": "2015-12-28T18:23:59Z", "bug_id": 58761, "creation_time": "2015-12-28T18:23:59Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
