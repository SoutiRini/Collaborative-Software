Seems rather strange.\nserver/log.c does not comment about this \"limitation\".\n\nCould we think about moving to the \"expected\" behavior ; making Apache to drop messages of notice level if LogLevel is set higher ?\n\nAnd backport this tiny change to 2.4.x ?\n\nCould be useful in some situations where we don't want these notice messages to appear in the logs.\n\nThank you very much !\n\nBest regards,\n\nBen", "id": 203291, "time": "2018-01-16T10:07:58Z", "bug_id": 62005, "creation_time": "2018-01-16T10:07:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 62005, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 203297, "time": "2018-01-16T10:26:09Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2018-01-16T10:26:09Z", "text": "as-is I would close this:  it's the design and there's no telling how many NOTICE level messages are out there expecting to be logged at any LogLevel.\n\nIf someone wants to develop an opt-in patch that alters the behavior more power to them."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 62005, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thank you Eric for your answer.\nUnderstood, as per the design some messages (the NOTICE ones) need then to be logged whatever ErrorLevel is.\nWhat is strange it that this behavior depends on the log provider.\nAnyway, I then close this feature request.\nThank you !", "id": 203329, "time": "2018-01-17T21:45:01Z", "creator": "ben.rubson@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2018-01-17T21:45:01Z", "is_private": false}]
