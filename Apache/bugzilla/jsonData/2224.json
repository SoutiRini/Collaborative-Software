[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2224, "text": "Today, log4j does not support defered logging, ie. we have to put the cat.debug\n() statement in the method calling the debugger, for example:\n\nclass SampleClass{\n\nvoid test(){\n log(\"blabla\");\n}\n\nvoid log(String s){\n cat.debug(s);\n}\n}\nwill print a debug statement like:\nSample class 8: blabla\n\nBut we wanted to have\nSample Class 4: blabla\n\nthis could be done using a method like\ncat.debug(\"blabla\",1) meaning, one-level deferentiation.\n\nI saw log4 implementation, it uses the StatckTrace to find the line number of \nthe calling method. It would just need to take a given of line down to have \nanother method call.\n\nFeel free to contact me for more information.\n\nReshad Moussa", "id": 3051, "time": "2001-06-18T14:26:03Z", "creator": "kblack@geocities.com", "creation_time": "2001-06-18T14:26:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2224, "text": "\nNot true.
