This column should then be returned instead of the name entered in j_username as username.\n\nReason: In many systems the USERS table is set up like this:\n\nCREATE TABLE t_login \n    ( \n     id INTEGER NOT NULL, \n     loginname VARCHAR2 (50 CHAR) NOT NULL, \n     passwdhash VARCHAR2 (64 CHAR) NOT NULL, \n     lastlogin DATE, \n     CONSTRAINT PK_login PRIMARY KEY (id),\n     CONSTRAINT UC_login_loginname UNIQUE (loginname)\n    );\n\nAs one can see the username is unique, but is not the primary key. This is necessary to be able change the username within you program. In this case all other tables with \"modified_by\"-columns will reference to the \"id\"-column, so the \"id\"-column is the column that is really needed in the application after a successful login.\n\nWhat do you think?", "id": 161584, "time": "2012-08-21T16:21:04Z", "creator": "blama@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2012-08-21T16:21:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 53756, "text": "The Realm API is concerned solely with authentication and authorisation of users.
