By nature, they should hence be announced with\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=brf\n\nJust like http://brl.thefreecat.org/test.php does.\n\nThe brf extension should hence be added to mime.types's text/plain entry, and AddCharset BRF .brf should be added to httpd.conf.\n\nSamuel"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 41241 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "is_private": false, "id": 97304, "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "time": "2006-12-25T15:05:19Z", "bug_id": 41240, "creation_time": "2006-12-25T15:05:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 97336, "time": "2006-12-26T07:42:01Z", "bug_id": 41240, "creation_time": "2006-12-26T07:42:01Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Not really duplicates, since this one was for 1.3.

Otherwise, adding it to mime.types would break some people's configs.\n\nAs far as the AddCharset issue, we don't ship with any AddCharset directives\nactivated by default in 2.2.  We could stick it in extra/httpd-languages.conf,\nbut that file is basically unmaintained garbage.

Even this doesn't get many hits in german's google.  There is hence a very low probability that this ever gets used as an exchange format.\n\nOn the contrary, the brf format for braille ascii is mostly and widely used for download on a wide range of website (this is actually how braille readers acquire books, pay taxes, etc).\n\nWhy I'm asking this to be the default for brf files is that people who run websites which propose .brf files will probably _not_ be skilled enough for knowing that to let visitors read them very easily, they should add the mime.types entry and the charset entry (remember that their area is accessibility, not computer administration).\n"}]
