All the modern browsers support it, but Chrome / FF run an NPN and forward secrecy check before enabling it [2,3].\n\nApache landed NPN in 552210 [4], but it does not advertise either \"http/1.0\" or \"http/1.1\" by default, which means that False Start can't be used. mod_spdy patches this in by default [5], but obviously it would be nice to not require mod_spdy to enable False Start!
