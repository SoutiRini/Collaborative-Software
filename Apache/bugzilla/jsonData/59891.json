I configured the tomcat-users.xml file  to allow access to the manager. Tomcat starts up and I can get to the manager page. I selected a WAR file to deploy. The full path to the WAR file displays with backslashes in the path, as is typical of a Windows installation. I click on \"Deploy\". \n\nTomcat strips out the backslashes and tries to load the WAR file with no directory separators in the path. In the applications list it displays this munged name as if it were the application. It fails to load the WAR file because it can not find the file. Tomcat 6 and 7 do not have this problem. I have not tried this on a Unix system.\nNote that I can manually copy the WAR file to the webapps directory and then it will auto-deploy correctly. The problem is that the manager module munges the WAR file path and thus fails to find the file."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "The root cause of this behaviour is the non-specifciation compliance of IE.
