However, the referenced URL\nhttp://mcc.id.au/temp/2006/redirect.js redirects to\nhttp://arc.mcc.id.au/temp/2006/nasty-redirected.js, and is then run, which makes\nthe second rect red.\n\nThere should be some way to enforce this using Java's security stuff, when the\nParsedURLData opens the URLConnection, but I am not very familiar with\npermissions and so on.  If this isn't possible, then I guess redirections could\nbe turned off for the URLConnection, which would then have to be handled manually.\n\nThis is probably a problem for the external resource origin setting, too.", "id": 87555, "time": "2006-04-04T05:37:43Z", "creator": "cam@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-04-04T05:37:43Z", "is_private": false}]
