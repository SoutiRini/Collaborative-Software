There are times when the processes are being restarted gracefully that a particular thread goes into a Closing state and never fully closes.  When this happens, the apache process is still using memory and is still running on the server itself.\n\nI can go to the command line and physically kill the processes that are hung up which will clear the server-status and have apache continuing to run as normal, but this is not a very hands free.\n\nI am unsure, because i have not let this happen, that would happen if i let it hang like this with the total number of servers that I have configured apache to use. \n\nI hope i have given you enough information here to help.", "id": 177381, "time": "2014-08-26T14:57:40Z", "bug_id": 56889, "creation_time": "2014-08-26T14:57:40Z", "attachment_id": null}]
