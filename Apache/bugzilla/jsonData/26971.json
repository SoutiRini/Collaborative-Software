[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 26971, "text": "Hi,\n\ni would like to see that the docs for 1.5.x would be online. A clean way would \nbe a version selection when clicking on \"documentation\" on the ANT website. \nThis way, people REALLY know that the actual documentation isnt necessarily \ntheir version of ANT. Many people get ANT bundlet with IDEs and the distros are \nmost likely not at the current ANT level.\n\nTake a look at IBM. They do it quite ellegantly with their websphere appserver \ndocumentation. This way, people dont get confused...\n\nMarc", "id": 52335, "time": "2004-02-16T13:05:58Z", "creator": "spam1@logemann.org", "creation_time": "2004-02-16T13:05:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 26971, "attachment_id": null, "id": 52341, "time": "2004-02-16T14:53:32Z", "creator": "stevel@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-02-16T14:53:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I am going to be unfair and mark this as a wontfix.\n\n1. IBM and Sun keep all their stuff online as they can afford to. Apache lives\noff donated bandwidth (and development effort) and cannot afford to host the\ndocumentation for everyone. Instead we host the manual pages of the latest\nshipping version, and not: any older versions, any newer versions, any javadocs.\n\n2. If you get your version in an IDE, you should encourage them to integrate the\nAnt docs into the IDE. Some do, and it makes for a very nice experience.\n\n3. You are free to download an old version of ant and extract the manual from that.\n\nIf you are able and willing to donate servers and diskspace we can revisit this\ndecision. Really. It is purely a bandwidth and capacity issue.
