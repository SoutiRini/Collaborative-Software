The specification only demands support for this if the META-INF/resources is inside of a jar file in the /WEB-INF/lib directory.\n\nTomcat passes this requirement because it serves files from jar but not from WEB-INF/classes. It seems Glassfish 3.0.1 however supports both type of locations.

Some environments, particularly IDEs, unpack all their JARs into the WEB-INF/classes directory. This would break static resources in JARs. Enabling this option works around this issue.\n\nSince this is a proprietary extension, it is disabled by default and controlled by an attribute on the StandardContext but is not part of the Context interface.", "id": 143505, "time": "2011-01-20T11:39:49Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-01-20T11:39:49Z", "is_private": false}]
