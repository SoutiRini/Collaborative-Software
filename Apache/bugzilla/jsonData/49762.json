[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The JSVGCanvas class [1] supports several canvas interactors [2], key-based and mouse-based (both often using key modifiers). The mouse-based can be disabled, using the setEnable*Interactor() [1][2]; the key-based ones currently cannot be disabled without extending the class.\n\nThere's a good description of the problem [3] and a proposed workaround [4] (through extending the class).\n\nThe idea would be either:\n1. Implement more setEnable*Interactor() methods to allow disabling key-based interactors: cursor keys, zoom in/out as well and maybe the reset transform as well;\n2. Adjust the setEnable*Interactor() methods to disable the key-based interaction as well. So, for example, \"setEnablePanInteractor\" method would disable the cursor key interaction as well (including the shift key modifier).\n\nThis can be seen either as an enhancement or a minor bug report (in the sense that currently there's already functionality for disabling mouse-based canvas interactors).\n\n[1] http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/javadoc/org/apache/batik/swing/JSVGCanvas.html\n[2] http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-batik/CanvasInteractors\n[3] http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-batik-users/201008.mbox/browser#msg-21\n[4] http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-batik-users/201008.mbox/browser#msg-22", "is_private": false, "id": 139141, "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "time": "2010-08-17T09:25:19Z", "bug_id": 49762, "creation_time": "2010-08-17T09:25:19Z", "attachment_id": null}]
