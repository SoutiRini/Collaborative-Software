Can you try this with FOP Trunk? I know an issue existed in FOP 0.95 and earlier where the encrypted PDF's document trailer contained a duplicate entry. Some older Acrobat versions and other PDF viewers used the wrong, non-encrypted entry, which lead to this error. Should be fixed in FOP Trunk for quite some time now.\n\n\nRegards\n\nAndreas", "id": 133394, "time": "2010-01-06T13:27:34Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-01-06T13:27:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48099, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This bug is not happening in FOP Trunk.
