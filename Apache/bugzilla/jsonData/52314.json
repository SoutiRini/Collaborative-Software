A new method that took first/last row index as parameters.\n2. The bulk of getColumnWidth extracted to be getCellWidth so callers can use it any way they want."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 152209, "time": "2011-12-16T10:01:20Z", "bug_id": 52314, "creation_time": "2011-12-16T10:01:20Z", "text": "Applied in r1215079\n\nYegor"}]
