Thus, all operations that can be performed on a category\ncan be performed on a logger. Whenever log4j is asked to produce a Category\nobject, it will instead produce a Logger object. However, methods that\npreviously accepted category objects still continue to accept category objects.\n\n\n\n\nOn Oct 29, 2004, at 12:07 AM, Stefano Mazzocchi wrote:\n\n>\n>  3) if not, if you are willing to work with the offended dependees to restore\ntheir success status.\n>\n>\n\n\nIt is late 2004 now.
