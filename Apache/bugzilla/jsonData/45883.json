This will run a script to replace the CDATA content of a style element.\n\nObserved: No change.\n\nExpected: The square should alternate between red and blue when clicked.\n\nWorkaround:  Replace the entire style element instead of its contents.\n\nAnalysis:  I think this is a simple copy-and-paste-o in SVGOMDocument.DOMCharacterDataModifiedListenerWrapper, which forwards its event using the subTreeModified(Node) method instead of characterDataModified(Node), which is what I would have expected.", "attachment_id": 22632, "bug_id": 45883, "id": 120946, "time": "2008-09-24T15:56:32Z", "creator": "steve@drakenz.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-24T15:56:32Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": 22633, "tags": [], "creator": "steve@drakenz.com", "text": "Created attachment 22633\nPatch to SVGOMDocument.DOMCharacterDataModifiedListenerWrapper", "count": 1, "id": 120947, "time": "2008-09-24T15:59:06Z", "bug_id": 45883, "creation_time": "2008-09-24T15:59:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Patch looks good and has been applied, thanks!
