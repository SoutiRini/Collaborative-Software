Typedefs of apr_[u]int*_t should be set to the respective [u]int*_t (from <sys/types.h>) and not be standard C types;\n\n2. The APR_SIZEOF_VOIDP is set to 4, irrespectively of the arch. This should be replaced by something like (for gcc):\n\n#if defined(__LP32__)\n  #define APR_SIZEOF_VOIDP 4\n#elif defined (__LP64__)\n  #define APR_SIZEOF_VOIDP 8\n#endif\n\nPatching the include/apr.h with these two changes allows the build to finish correctly, but it would be nice to get rid of them, if possible.\n\nThanks!", "id": 122602, "time": "2008-11-18T13:27:44Z", "bug_id": 46233, "creation_time": "2008-11-18T13:27:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
