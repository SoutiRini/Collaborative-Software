However, the fist row shows that column contents that should not appear appear in the wrong columns (as if no column had been removed). The second row does not display and the console shows the following exception trace.\n\nException in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 24, Size: 24\n        at java.util.ArrayList.RangeCheck(Unknown Source)\n        at java.util.ArrayList.get(Unknown Source)\n        at org.apache.log4j.chainsaw.ChainsawCyclicBufferTableModel.getValueAt(ChainsawCyclicBufferTableModel.java:440)\n        at javax.swing.JTable.getValueAt(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JTable.prepareRenderer(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTableUI.paintCell(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTableUI.paintCells(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTableUI.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI.update(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintComponent(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintChildren(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JViewport.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintChildren(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintChildren(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintChildren(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JSplitPane.paintChildren(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintChildren(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JSplitPane.paintChildren(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintToOffscreen(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.BufferStrategyPaintManager.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.RepaintManager.paint(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent._paintImmediately(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.JComponent.paintImmediately(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.RepaintManager.paintDirtyRegions(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.RepaintManager.paintDirtyRegions(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.RepaintManager.seqPaintDirtyRegions(Unknown Source)\n        at javax.swing.SystemEventQueueUtilities$ComponentWorkRequest.run(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.event.InvocationEvent.dispatch(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue.access$000(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue$1.run(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue$1.run(Unknown Source)\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n        at java.security.AccessControlContext$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source)", "id": 164180, "time": "2012-12-20T15:10:17Z", "creator": "alain.pannetier@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-12-20T15:10:17Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
