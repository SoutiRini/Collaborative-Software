This happens because hasNext() only checks if there are more aliases. If the next alias contains a symmetric key, there is no certificate in the KeyStore entry and next() returns null. When you look at the KeyResolvers, they are not prepared to handle a null value, this will cause a NullPointerException.\n\nTo reproduce, use the junit KeyStoreResolverTest in the attachment.", "id": 137682, "time": "2010-06-16T12:29:05Z", "bug_id": 49447, "creation_time": "2010-06-16T12:29:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25599}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "coheigea@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "\nThanks for the patch, I'll take a look.\n\nColm.", "id": 137684, "time": "2010-06-16T13:31:29Z", "bug_id": 49447, "creation_time": "2010-06-16T13:31:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49447, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 137692, "time": "2010-06-16T15:37:45Z", "creator": "Clement_Pellerin@ibi.com", "creation_time": "2010-06-16T15:37:45Z", "text": "This patch has a bug in the implementation of next() because it never returns NoSuchElementException.
