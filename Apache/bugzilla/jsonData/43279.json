Those are the two\npieces of code making the call above. They have been fixed with null checks for\nthe returned identity from the session.\n\nTo test the fix for bug 42370, I started up two lenya sessions on two different\nboxes at the same time with clean builds, except one didn't have the patch from\nr571481. I then: logged in, imported, viewed sessions, logged out, waited two\nhours, tried to log back in, got the stack dump for stale session, really logged\nin, viewed sessions. The one with the patch worked, the one without the patch\ndidn't. \n\nI'm not entire sure what causes the problem, but expired sessions seem to be a\npossibility. I don't know if this is a bug, or just something we need to be\naware of."}]
