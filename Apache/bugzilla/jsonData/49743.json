This bug seems to be present since many years already (some reports dating back until 2004). Many people reporting it in several forums, but obviously nobody filed a bug report yet.\n\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_include.html#element.echo\n\nThe whole encoding is not doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n<!--#echo encoding=\"url\" var=\"HTTP_REFERER\" -->\n\nThe resulting URL is NOT ENCODED at all, just returned back AS IS.\n\nHowever, if I DON'T WANT encoding (encoding=\"none\") and passing a HTML encoded variable like this...\n\n<!--#set var=\"title\" value=\"&auml;&ouml;&uuml;\" -->\n<!--#echo encoding=\"none\" var=\"titel\" -->\n\n...it is being DECODED as plain UTF-8 ! I couldn't find a way to return the original HTML encoded string. \n\nIf I *WANT* encoding, I don't get encoding.\nIf I *DON'T WANT* encoding, I get decoding.\n\nReally strange behaviour..."}]
