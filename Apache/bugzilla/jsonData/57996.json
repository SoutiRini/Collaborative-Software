Attempts to follow them result in error AH00037 being logged. The configuration permits following symlinks if the owner matches.\n\nOn investigation, it appeared that the problematic symlinks are those where the link has an inode number that fits within 32 bits but the target does not.\n\nI have developed a patch and successfully tested it on top of httpd 2.4.10 as packaged in Debian 8. Inspection of the head of the 2.4 branch in svn suggests that the bug is still present there.", "id": 183310, "time": "2015-06-03T16:36:40Z", "bug_id": 57996, "creation_time": "2015-06-03T16:36:40Z", "is_private": false}]
