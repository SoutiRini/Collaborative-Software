Whenever two svg images appear on the same page, the second one disappears\ncompletely. This was caused by the translate at the end of renderSVGDocument\nmethod not being the correct inverse of the preceding one.\n\n2. Any attempt to scale the image failed. Fixed by using the position's width\nand height rather than the image's.\n\n3. Any attempt to use an image larger than 100x100 caused erroneous cropping.\nFixed by scaling as above. However, if the image is larger than 100x100 and\nno viewbox is defined in the svg file, cropping will still occur. This\nrestriction also holds for PDF (and other?) renderers."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "richardw@geoquip-rnd.demon.co.uk", "attachment_id": 16310, "text": "Created attachment 16310\nPatch for java2d/svg bugs", "id": 79411, "time": "2005-09-05T17:23:29Z", "bug_id": 36505, "creation_time": "2005-09-05T17:23:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Applied with comments and modifications.
