[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9982, "text": "I use Batik 1.5 CVS, jdk140 on Linux Suse7.2\n\nThe problem is with the screen coordinates obtained from the Batik MouseEvent.\n\n====================== Start of the first part ======================\n\nWhen I click on an element in the viewer I print the screen coordinate:\n\n        event.getScreenX() and event.getScreenY().\n\nI also print the coordinates obtained from the java mouse event:\n\n        Point p = event.getPoint();\n        SwingUtilities.convertPointToScreen( p, (Component)event.getSource() );\n\n        p.getX() and p.getY()\n\nThese two coordinates should be the same (shouldn't they?)! The fact is that\nthey aren't. The problem becomes bigger when I zoom the SVG image (with my own\nzoom: scaling the renderingtransform of the SVGview). When zooming in, the\ncoordinates of the batik mousevents seem to become smaller and smaller. \nSome debug output:\n(no zoom)\n     [java] Java screen coords: 0.0, 0.0\n     [java] Batik screen coords: 57, 94\n     [java] Java screen coords: 1279.0, 1023.0\n     [java] Batik screen coords: 909, 760\n(200% zoom)\n     [java] Java screen coords: 0.0, 0.0\n     [java] Batik screen coords: 127, 191\n     [java] Java screen coords: 1270.0, 1015.0\n     [java] Batik screen coords: 537, 499\n(400% zoom)\n     [java] Java screen coords: 0.0, 4.0\n     [java] Batik screen coords: 157, 210\n     [java] Java screen coords: 1279.0, 1023.0\n     [java] Batik screen coords: 370, 374\n\n====================== end of the first part ======================\n\nAfter this, Thierry fixed it, but unfortunately not completely. Problem is that\nI don't get the location of the occurrence of the event, but only the upper left\ncoordinates (in screenspace) of the canvas.....These coords ARE correct though,\nso the start is good!\n\nPlease fix it, I need it ;-)\n\nMichael.", "id": 18030, "time": "2002-06-19T07:11:02Z", "creator": "michiel@microweb.nl", "creation_time": "2002-06-19T07:11:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
