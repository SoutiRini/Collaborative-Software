A previous\nheader is replaced by the new header. Where a set of header values exist for the\nname, the values are cleared and replaced with the new value.\n-----\n\nThis requirement has been true since at least Servlets 2.2 (same location in\nSerlvets 2.3 specification; SRV.6.2, para 2 in the Servlets 2.2 specification).\n\nWhere only one value exists, the setHeader( ) method properly replaces it with\nthe specified value.\n\nAttached is a patch that fixes the bug.  In creating the patch, I found that:\n\n  a) the setHeader( ) method in Response relies on the\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders class's setValue( ) method.\n  b) the setValue( ) method in MimeHeaders relies on getValue( ) in MimeHeaders\n  c) the getValue( ) method in MimeHeaders explicitly states, \"If more than one\nsuch field is in the header, an arbitrary one is returned.\"\n  d) the MimeHeaders class's source code is prefixed with: \"XXX XXX XXX Need a\nmajor rewrite  !!!!\"\n\nTherefore, with the existing MimeHeaders class, all existing header values must\nbe removed before calling getValue( ).  If the MimeHeaders class is rewritten,\nthis requirement may be alleviated by a design change in consideration of the\nServlet Specification's requirements for setHeader( ).\n\nThe attached patch simply removes the named header (by calling MimeHeader's\nremoveHeader( ) method) before calling MimeHeader's setValue( ) method.  This\nmeans that the removeHeader( ) method will be called with every execution of the\nResponse's setHeader( ) method.  Since removeHeader( ) iterates over every\nheader, we incur a penalty for every execution of setHeader( ), and the penalty\ngrows as the number of headers increases.  However, since:\n\n  a) there is no way to find out whether multiple values exist for a specified\nheader (other than iterating as is done by removeHeader( ))\n  b) the containsHeader( ) and getHeader( ) methods iterate over the headers (by\ncalling getValue( )) (as is done by removeHeader( ))\n  c) the average number of headers is small (assumed to be about 8)\n\nattempting to determine if multiple values exist for the header before calling\nremoveHeader( ) is fruitless since the same penalty is paid whether zero, one,\nor multiple values exist for the named header and the penalty is identical to\nthat imposed by calling the removeHeader( ) method without first checking for\nthe existence of a header.  If checking first, the penalty would double for the\ncase where multiple values exist.  If the assumption that the number of headers\nis small holds true, the penalty should be minimal.\n\nI'm marking the severity as minor because the bug is unlikely to affect many\nusers (only those trying to replace all values of a header with multiple values)\nand workarounds exist (i.e. ensure that the headers are set to their correct\nvalue the first time ;), or reset the response while retaining and setting the\nvalues that should not be replaced).  However, until this bug is fixed, Tomcat\nis not in compliance with the Servlet Specification.  ;)\n\nThis bug is also confirmed to exist in Tomcat  CVS, 5.5.8, 5.5.7, and in 5.0.30\ncode.  It may also exist in Tomcat 4.x and Tomcat 3.x.\n\nAttached patch fixes the bug.
