[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45166, "text": "Hi\n\nI am new to Jmeter and am having some problems when trying to do a load test. I have recorded a script by using my PC as an IE proxy and testing my application. However, when I try to replay this script to simulate a higher number of users, it does not seem to be running the SQL in the Oracle 10G database that it is supposed to get it's data from. I can see the JDBC Thin Client process creating a session on the database and I can see the SQL when it logs on but nothing else.\n\nIs there any in particular that I need to tell Jmeter so that it runs all the SQL that was used in the script recording? Can anyone give me some tips on how to run these tests successfully?\n\nAny Help Appreciated.\n\nMichael Campbell", "id": 117494, "time": "2008-06-09T00:37:42Z", "creator": "michael.campbell@canadalife.ie", "creation_time": "2008-06-09T00:37:42Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please raise this on the JMeter user list.\n\nBugzilla is not a suitable forum for usage questions.", "id": 117495, "time": "2008-06-09T01:14:11Z", "bug_id": 45166, "creation_time": "2008-06-09T01:14:11Z", "is_private": false}]
