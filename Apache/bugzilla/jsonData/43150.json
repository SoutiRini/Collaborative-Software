Briefly, the exception on startup can be\nfixed but that reveals problems in other Tomcat components.\n\n1. CNFE on startup (problem reported by Markus):\nCaused by a problem with File.toURL called from o.a.c.startup.ClassLoaderFactory.\nCan be fixed by Sun's suggested workaround of using File.toURI and URI.toURL -\nsee http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/File.html#toURL()\n\n2. After fixing that, Tomcat starts but JSPs won't run because Jasper is putting\nits output files in the wrong directory.\nThis is caused by some strange-looking code in\no.a.jasper.JspCompilationContext.createOutputDir that mixes file and URL syntax\ntogether to create the wrong directory.\n\n3, etc. There are several other places in Tomcat where File.toURL is used and I\nthink it could have problems with \"#\" in pathnames, but I don't know what the\neffects are. I've noted *potential* problems in:\no.a.c.ant, o.a.c.core, o.a.c.ha.deploy, o.a.c.loader, o.a.c.startup, o.a.jasper.\n\nI could help fix some of the problems, but there are lots that I haven't figured\nout. Is it worth the trouble to find and fix all the related problems, or is it\nbetter to just tell people not to use unusual directory names?\n", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43150, "is_private": false, "id": 116118, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-05-01T14:24:05Z", "time": "2008-05-01T14:24:05Z", "text": "I have fixed the bits that are clearly broken and proposed the patch for 6.0.x\n\nAs for the rest, if it ain't broke..."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43150, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This has been fixed in 6.0.x and will be included in 6.0.17 onwards.", "id": 116674, "time": "2008-05-15T12:26:56Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-05-15T12:26:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43150, "attachment_id": null, "text": "*** Bug 46400 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 123502, "time": "2008-12-23T07:22:37Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-12-23T07:22:37Z", "is_private": false}]
