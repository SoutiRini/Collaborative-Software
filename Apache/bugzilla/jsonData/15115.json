It says:\n\n<quote>\nxerces.jar - The XML parser that is visible by default to Tomcat\ninternal classes and to web applications. This can be overridden, for\na particular web application, by including your desired parser in /WEB-INF/lib.\n</quote>\n\nThat is very wrong and violates the Sun classloading spec.  Tomcat has\nenforced this since 4.0.2, but things were buggy at that time so\nTomcat didn't do a perfect job at ignoring the XML parser.  Instead,\nyou'd get ClassCastExceptions and such.  I'm\npretty sure Xerces is mostly ignored in Tomcat-4.1.12.  The XML parser\nshould exist in one of a few places:\n\n1.  In the JDK (true with j2sdk1.4.x)\n2.  Overridden in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed\n3.  Overridden in CATALINA_HOME/common/endorsed\n4.  Be placed in CATALINA_HOME/common/lib.  Note that this will not\noverride existing XML parsers from endorsed directories, but if you\nare using JDK1.3.x, then it will be used since that JDK version\ndoesn't include an XML parser.  The Xerces classes will be\nloaded either way...unless the full Xerces is in an endorsed directory\nalready.\n\nSee the following bug reports and comments by Remy and others about why it is\ntrue that the XML parser (and DOM libraries) should *not* be in WEB-INF/lib....\n\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6248\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6476\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6374\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7175\n\nJake", "is_private": false, "id": 27474, "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "time": "2002-12-05T18:19:24Z", "bug_id": 15115, "creation_time": "2002-12-05T18:19:24Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15115, "text": "The 5.5.x onwards docs are correct / have been corrected.
