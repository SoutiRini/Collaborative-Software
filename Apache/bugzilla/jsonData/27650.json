The bug is still there if I fix the duplication.\n\nThen it does change-object-path-back which doesn't really change all that much\nin the xml\n\nAfter that the xml is sent to the source writing transformer. After the source\nwriting transformer the file only contains the xml declaration and the comment.\nThe actual content is gone.\n\nI added the following pipelines to debug this:\n\n<map:transform type=\"log\">\n  <map:parameter name=\"logfile\" value=\"logfile.log\"/>\n  <map:parameter name=\"append\" value=\"no\"/>\n</map:transform>\n\nI also changed the serializer of the source writing transformer (as follows) but\nthat didn't solve the problem\n\n<map:transform type=\"write-source\">\n  <map:parameter name=\"serializer\" value=\"xml\"/>   \n</map:transform>\n\nMaybe this is a bug in the endRecording method of AbstractXMLTransformer?", "attachment_id": null, "id": 54066, "creation_time": "2004-03-16T13:45:03Z", "time": "2004-03-16T13:45:03Z", "creator": "egli@apache.org", "bug_id": 27650, "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27650, "attachment_id": null, "text": "i moved the license inside the root element. im rnaming the bug and punting", "id": 54183, "time": "2004-03-17T19:52:27Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-03-17T19:52:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27650, "attachment_id": null, "id": 66220, "time": "2004-11-01T04:22:55Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-11-01T04:22:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "i tried this with lenya of today and it works. closing."}]
