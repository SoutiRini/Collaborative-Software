It turned out that protected <T> T getCheckedRef(final Class<T> requiredClass,\n                                  final String dataTypeName, final Project project)\nchecks for requiredClass.isAssignableFrom(o.getClass()) and fails with a BuildException if it is false. It my case the classes are the same but do have different IDs in the debugger because they where loaded from different classloaders. In that case the log message says: \"Class MyClass is not a subclass of MyClass\"\n\nThis is not helpful and confusing. It should either check classloaders too or at least add the identity hash code of the class' classloader to denote the real difference.", "id": 177012, "time": "2014-08-08T13:20:34Z", "creator": "1983-01-06@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2014-08-08T13:20:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 178006, "time": "2014-09-21T11:42:28Z", "bug_id": 56830, "creation_time": "2014-09-21T11:42:28Z", "text": "add classloader information with git commit 963d6c9"}]
