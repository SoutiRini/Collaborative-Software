AbstractBreaker is then asked to split before the content, which it is not designed for.\n\nWhen the flow IPD changes the overflow mechanism must be disabled, since anyway the line breaking has to be re-done according to the new IPD.", "id": 163529, "time": "2012-11-19T12:18:24Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-19T12:18:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 29607}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in rev. 1411306:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1411306&view=rev", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 54167, "id": 163536, "time": "2012-11-19T16:58:23Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-19T16:58:23Z", "attachment_id": null}]
