All SVG text variants including flow text are supported. The old, incomplete PSTextPainter is completely replaced. The old one was inactive anyway due to a bug.\n\nAs with the PDFTextPainter, the PSTextPainter relies on Batik font subsystem (which uses Java2D/AWT fonts) for font availability and tries to map those to internally configured fonts. Since PS output currently only supports Type 1 fonts, there might be difficulties matching the fonts as not all JVMs properly support and report Type 1 fonts installed in the operating systems. Furthermore, not all glyphs in the Type 1 font may be available as a result.\n\nSome numbers to illustrate the improvement (size of EPS files generated by EPSTranscoder):\nW3C SVG test suite, text-path-01-b.svg, old: 103KB, new 17KB\nW3C SVG test suite, text-deco-01-b.svg, old: 123KB, new 20KB\nbatik/samples/extensions/flowText.svg, old: 413KB, new 24KB"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47000, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 126115, "time": "2009-04-08T12:53:15Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-04-08T12:53:15Z", "text": "Please don't review just yet.
