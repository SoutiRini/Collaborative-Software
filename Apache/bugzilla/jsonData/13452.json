[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13452, "text": "This is an extreme case and I doubt many people would encounter the problem, but\nfor large test cases with 50K or more URL's JMeter has difficulty loading the\nfile. Running large test cases is only feasible in nongui mode, since the test\ncase file could be 45+ megs. I had a couple thoughts on how the problem might be\ntackled.\n\n1. pre-parse the test case and compile the http requests to a temp directory.\n\n2. rather than load the whole test case, the file could be separated into\nmultiple files. One file would contain the minimal information and the other\nfiles would contain the actual request nodes. This way, the test case can be\nloaded, but not the actual requests. The first file would link to the file\ncontaining the request nodes.\n\n3. set a limit on the number of requests to load and pre-fetch. it would mean\njmeter would have to keep track of which line it loaded last.\n\n4. create n number of temporary cache and break the test case into chunks.\nSimilar to how vim loads large files.\n\nFor now I can get around the \"outofmemory error\" by running jmeter from a box\nwith lots of memory. One other option is to have a Generic random URL generator,\nwhich can take n valid values and generate random URL's. There are occasions\nwhen I want to do really large tests with 100K urls, so there must be others who\nhave the need.\n\npeter lin", "id": 24201, "time": "2002-10-09T13:38:10Z", "creator": "woolfel@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2002-10-09T13:38:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "mstover1@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 36307, "time": "2003-04-29T19:40:11Z", "bug_id": 13452, "creation_time": "2003-04-29T19:40:11Z", "tags": [], "text": "I think you'll have a better chance doing this in the latest code."}]
