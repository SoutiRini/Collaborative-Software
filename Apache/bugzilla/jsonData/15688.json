However, does the spec say, what happens if another import \"shadows\" the import of those packages?\n\nI guess, nothing in the spec prevents you from using the fully qualified classnames. (I'm not asking your to remove the imports - that would clearly violate the spec.)"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 143297, "time": "2011-01-12T04:16:49Z", "bug_id": 15688, "creation_time": "2011-01-12T04:16:49Z", "text": "The original issue description requested that Jasper \"use full-qualified names instead of imports\".
