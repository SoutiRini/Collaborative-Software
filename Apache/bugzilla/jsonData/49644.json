Dont' forget to provide the following information:\n\n- what exactly was the file you downloaded two weeks ago\n- what exactly was the download file that you think is broken now\n- provide md5 checksums for those files\n- If you try to compile yourself, what are the steps you do\n- What do you mean by \"no go at all\"? Which configuration did you use? Anything in the error log?\n\nRegards,\n\nRainer", "id": 138670, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2010-07-25T06:29:20Z", "time": "2010-07-25T06:29:20Z", "is_private": false}]
