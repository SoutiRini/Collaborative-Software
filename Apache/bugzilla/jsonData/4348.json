Both Batik and Cocoon have mechanisms to get around\nthis limitation.  Cocoon provides an implementation for Batik\nso that users can keep using the \"context://\" protocol.

That\nwould reduce the number of URL adapters a project needs to write.\n\nIn fact, since FOP already used Batik for inline SVG graphics,\nit would be a natural extension to use their mechanism.
