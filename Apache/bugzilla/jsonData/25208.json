This is very annoying.\n\nIt seems to me like the reason is that the \"write data to file\" subframe atop\nthese windows wants do display all its elements horizontally, resulting in a\nvery large frame, must larger than my JMeter window or even my screen.\n\n(back from German to English:)\n\"write all ...\":\n\"enter file name ... or new name\"\n     [filename input field]\n           [choose file button]\n                 \"log errors only\"\n-- all in one line, makes it very large. Too large.\n\nI believe this subframe should try to adapt its size to the surrounding frame\n(the right hand side of the JMeter display), not impose it a huge size.\n\nAs a current consequence, the \"view results in table\" rows are too large for\nmy window/screen, so one cannot easily view them and is constantly moving\nscrollbars, whereas the best-fit width of the table would actually be much,\nmuch smaller.\n\nOther elements, e.g. HTTP request or test plan just fit into the right hand side \nframe and don't introduce horizontal scrollbars. These also resize well.\n\n-- seen on Suse Linux 9, local display\n-- also on MS-Windows, local displa"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25208, "is_private": false, "text": "Certainly annoying, but still a minor bug -- I mean we have much worse ones\nwaiting on the line :-(", "id": 51031, "time": "2004-01-23T02:00:12Z", "creator": "jsalvata@atg.com", "creation_time": "2004-01-23T02:00:12Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25208, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 52482, "time": "2004-02-18T13:29:50Z", "creator": "Joerg-Cyril.Hoehle@t-systems.com", "creation_time": "2004-02-18T13:29:50Z", "text": "I understand it's minor, but it's been there in 1.7.x, 1.8, 1.9.1.
