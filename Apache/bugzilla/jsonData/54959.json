But the behavior is highly inconsistent. Sometimes the timeouts work, but most of the times they don't. \n\nI have tried this on Tomcat 7.0.20, 7.0.37, 7.0.40. Nothing seems to help. Am i doing something wrong? \n\nPlease help. Apologize if I am wasting your time! But I need to fix it. \n\nThanks"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "Bugzilla is mot a support forum.
