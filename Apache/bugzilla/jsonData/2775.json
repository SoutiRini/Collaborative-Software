Hence numguess always thinks your guess is\nthe first guess; the log shows the assignment of a new session ID\nwith each request.\n\n--------------------\nSystem Configuration\n\n- Redhat Linux 7.1 (stock)\n- Apache 1.3.19 DSO (stock w/ RH7.1)\n- Tomcat 4.0b6 binary distribution\n- apr snapshot - CHANGES shows b1\n- jakarta-tomcat-connectors snapshot - date is morning after 4.0b6 release\n- Warp connector code: Erroneous behavior persists whether warp.jar in\n  Tomcat distro, or warp.jar built with \"--with-java\" in\n  jakarta-tomcat-connectors are used.", "id": 3985, "time": "2001-07-24T17:58:47Z", "bug_id": 2775, "creation_time": "2001-07-24T17:58:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2775, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Example 1 has been fixed as of now in CVS.
