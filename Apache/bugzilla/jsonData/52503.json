Both show the \"do you want to save the changes?\" dialogue, but then:\n* [1] shows a file save dialogue\n* [2] just saves the file (I prefer this).\n\nRant: The problem with the File->Close approach esp. as it opens the file save dialogue at some default location that is not the file path and also does not put the file name in the naming field.\n\nConclusion: I would love if this behaviour was unified, preferably to the close window behaviour because of the stated reasons.\n\nbr,\nImm\n\n\nA little OT: are there some ressources how to get myself started with some volunteer work?
