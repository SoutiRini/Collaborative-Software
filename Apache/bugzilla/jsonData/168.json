The problem here is that it is impossible to specify an argument to the java task which contains a space. This is because the attribute value is tokenized on the space character. My proposal is to provide an alternative specification of this similar to the way PATH like values can be specified. For example:\r\n\r\n<java ....>\r\n  <arglist>\r\n    <arg>Something with a space</arg>\r\n     ...\r\n  </arglist>\r\n  <jvmarglist>\r\n    <arg>-Djava.ext.dirs=/classes</arg>\r\n  </jvmarglist>\r\n</java>\r\n\r\n"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 168, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 2594, "time": "2001-05-22T03:02:49Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-05-22T03:02:49Z", "text": "Fixed in Ant 1.2 - or was it 1.1?"}]
