[{"count": 0, "text": "I think I found quite big hole in 2.0.40 build. It's related with SSI and PHP \nparsing. When trying to include more than one .php file in different locations \nof the html code inside .shtml file the 1st outputs nicely but the rest ones \nafter that doesn't parse at all. I am using PHP version 4.2.3-dev and windows \n2000 pro with servicepack 3. An easy setup to find the error:\nmake test.shtml that has this:\n--------------------------\n<!--# include virtual=\"/phpinfo.php\" --><br>\n<!--# include virtual=\"/phpinfo.php\" -->\n--------------------------\nsave and into the same folder make phpinfo.php that has this inside:\n--------------------------\n<?php\n  phpinfo();\n?>\n--------------------------\nNow when opening test.shtml it should print phpinfo 2 times, right? The actual \noutput only has phpinfo listed once and the second include comes into html \nsource as <?php phpinfo();?>. It seems that the server doesn't parse the 2nd \nphp file included. If I disable the first include (example point it to file \nthat doesn't exists) the second one starts working. No errors are generated \ninto the error.log file. \nI haven't tested this on 1.3.26 version but what I've heard it works fine in \nit, so I quess this is only 2.x issue at the moment.\nSorry if I made this bugreport some wrong way, I'm quite newbie to apache and \nphp and I understand if this issue is just becouse I'm not aware of something.\nI rounded many irc channels to get confirmation about this and ppl who helped \nme considered this also as a bugissue of apache.\n___________\nVesa Laakso", "bug_id": 12542, "is_private": false, "id": 22693, "time": "2002-09-11T17:25:21Z", "creator": "vlaakso@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2002-09-11T17:25:21Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "[This is a mass bug update.]\nThis bug reports a problem in an older version of Apache 2.\nCould you please update to the most recent version and see\nif you can reproduce this problem.
