They thus unpredictably returned wrong values when using them in a multithreaded environment.\nThis patch fixes this.\n\nThe code is tested, but whether the multithreading issues I encountered are actually gone will only show in a week or two. It's a rather simple patch, so I'm quite confident anyways."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58039, "text": "Just noticed that this bug also affects non-threaded but nested uses of a D* function.
