When the client is trying to connect to the server, the server is closing the connection but is not sending a TLS Alert. \n\nI will attach the used configuration for that part and a wireshark record.\n\nThe problem is also occuring on linux openSUSE.\n\nTested with curl (7.55.1 (x86_64-w64-mingw32) libcurl/7.55.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2l zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.23.1) and command \"curl --tlsv1.0 --insecure <address>\"", "id": 202431, "time": "2017-11-27T19:00:56Z", "creator": "michael.nguyen@bertelsmann.de", "creation_time": "2017-11-27T19:00:56Z", "attachment_id": 35556}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61824, "attachment_id": null, "id": 203270, "time": "2018-01-15T12:55:29Z", "creator": "michael.nguyen@bertelsmann.de", "creation_time": "2018-01-15T12:55:29Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Hey,\n\ni'm sorry for this bug report.\n\nThe issue lies in the OpenSSL version 1.0.2l.
