So that does not help.\n\nUsing a custom logger is not an easy enough solution for my needs.\n\nSo I propose one or several of the following:\n- option \"--nototaltime\" that just suppresses the Total time line, regardless of other flags\n- option \"--deterministic-output\" that tells the intention more clearly, in case there are other possible nondeterministic output cases\n\nYet another option is to make another flag like \"-S\" that suppresses all _irrelevant_ output. Now it's printing all relevant output produced directly by ant, but this new option would also print all relevant output (actually, all output) by code executed with <java> and <exec>"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Oh, yet another option: instead of new flags just add a new logger implementation to the ant distribution.
