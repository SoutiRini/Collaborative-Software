Say, if there is any issue in FCGI, it has to fall back to CGI.?\n\nAsk the mod_fastcgi folks if it can fail gracefully in a way that allows another module to take control.  (I seriously doubt it.)  This would likely mean determining that the request processing had not proceeded far enough to change application state and changing the handler to something else and declining.  The desired behavior is probably to get it to try harder to recover instead of backing down to CGI.  (For example, if PHP can't run as a FastCGI server for whatever reason it is likely that it can't run as CGI either.)\n\n>Also i would like to know whether FCGI process can be restarted independently based on certain conditions?\n\nAsk the mod_fastcgi folks.  (I guess you mean a FastCGI process managed by mod_fastcgi.)"}]
