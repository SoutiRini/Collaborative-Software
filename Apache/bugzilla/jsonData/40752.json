When the image file is approx. larger \nthan 65 KB, it's partially sent to the browser.\n\nDownloading other large files works fine. For example, I have no trouble \ndownloading a 2MB RAR archive from my server.\n\n\nError log:\n-------------------------------------------\nNo errors listed in the logs.\n\n\nConfiguration:\n-------------------------------------------\nStandard configuration as supplied by the installer, modified to load the \nPHP5.2 module.\n\n\nWorkaround:\n-------------------------------------------\nAdd Handlers for gif,jpg,png to redirect requests to a PHP script. This script \nreads the image file and outputs it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40752, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 94803, "time": "2006-10-13T06:03:33Z", "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-13T06:03:33Z", "text": "Pointing to one of several reports of the same thing.
