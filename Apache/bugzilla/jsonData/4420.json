According to 3.3 [4], \"the complete definitions of the \u00b7built-in\u00b7  \n\u00b7derived\u00b7 datatypes are provided in Appendix A.\"  But the definition for \ninteger that appears in the Schema for Datatype Definitions in Appendix A [5] \ndoes not prohibit a trailing decimal point from appearing on an integer value.  \nSo my guess is that 3.3.13.1 is in error, but that's just a guess.
