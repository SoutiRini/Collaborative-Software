This makes AreaPtg(String), Area3DPtg(String, externIdx), Area3DPxg(SheetIdentifier, String), Area3DPxg(int, SheetIdentifier, String) deprecated constructors. I have provided alternative constructors for all but Area3DPtg (I saw other constructors with Ptg(int externIdx, String ref), so I didn't want to add another constructor in case this gets refactored in the future to make the parameter order consistent. Added test cases for new constructors.\n\nOverhauled ErrPtg to replace the deprecated ErrorConstants (as of r1658185) with FormulaError. org.apache.poi.ss.forumula.constant/ErrorConstant.java looks like it duplicates the functionality of org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.ErrorConstants (deprecated) and org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.FormulaError. Some decision should be made to consolidate these classes if only one is needed. My suggestion is to deprecate org.apache.poi.ss.formula.constant.ErrorConstant so that only FormulaError remains (FormulaError is an enum and has the highest quality and cquantity conversion methods.\n\nMoved several hard-coded strings in Ptg classes to static class variables.", "id": 184976, "time": "2015-09-04T23:52:29Z", "bug_id": 58331, "creation_time": "2015-09-04T23:52:29Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 33063}]
