An xml-rpc call is\nnot  posted in the usual name=value structure, but simply as one big chunk of\nxml. I have made a patch which first of all check if the postdata is xml, by\nusing some very simple string comparison on the query string. If the postdata\nseems to be xml, it is parsed as xml and checked against an un-official xml-rpc\nxsd schema taken from ibiblio.org. If any error occurs or the xml-rpc cannot be\nvalidated against the schema, the request is recorded the usual way.\n\nThis is my first patch for the jmeter project, so please bear with me."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41707, "attachment_id": 19639, "is_private": false, "id": 99805, "time": "2007-02-26T09:39:26Z", "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-26T09:39:26Z", "text": "Created attachment 19639\nHTTPSamplerBase supporting xml-rpc recording."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 19640\nXmlRpcErrorHandler used for xsd schema checking of xml-rpc call", "id": 99806, "time": "2007-02-26T09:40:14Z", "bug_id": 41707, "creation_time": "2007-02-26T09:40:14Z", "attachment_id": 19640}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 19641\nXML-RPC xsd schema (un-official)", "id": 99807, "time": "2007-02-26T09:40:52Z", "bug_id": 41707, "creation_time": "2007-02-26T09:40:52Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 19641}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41707, "attachment_id": 19645, "is_private": false, "id": 99852, "time": "2007-02-27T08:32:01Z", "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-27T08:32:01Z", "text": "Created attachment 19645\nHTTPSamplerBase supporting xml-rpc recording, cleaned up"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41707, "attachment_id": 19646, "is_private": false, "id": 99853, "time": "2007-02-27T08:34:45Z", "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-27T08:34:45Z", "text": "Created attachment 19646\nXmlRpcErrorHandler used for xsd schema checking of xml-rpc call"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41707, "attachment_id": 19647, "is_private": false, "id": 99854, "time": "2007-02-27T08:35:36Z", "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-27T08:35:36Z", "text": "Created attachment 19647\nXML-RPC xsd schema (un-official)"}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 19656\nHTTPSamplerBase supporting xml-rpc and other not-\"name=value\" postdata.\n\nThis version should not affect any other classes using the parseArguments\nmethod, as last patch did.", "id": 99973, "time": "2007-03-02T07:40:04Z", "bug_id": 41707, "creation_time": "2007-03-02T07:40:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 19656}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41707, "attachment_id": 19657, "is_private": false, "id": 99974, "time": "2007-03-02T07:41:03Z", "creator": "jthorhauge@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-03-02T07:41:03Z", "text": "Created attachment 19657\nAs commented by sebb, the fix should go into HttpRequestHdr.java instead of httpsamplerbase"}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41707, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 99998, "time": "2007-03-03T04:56:35Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-03-03T04:56:35Z", "text": "Thanks!\n\nNow fixed in SVN.\n\nIt will be in the next release and the next nightly build at:\n\nhttp://people.apache.org/builds/jakarta-jmeter/nightly/\n\n"}]
