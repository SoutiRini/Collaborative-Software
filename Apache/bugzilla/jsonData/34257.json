[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "In my work when creating a fully automaic test process on winCE devices, I\nneeded a way to talk to a FTP server and issue certain SITE commands. (The SITE\ncommand can start programs on the device, boot the device, etc). \nThe ANT FTP taks can do most of the things I want, move files back and forth;\nbut it could not issue specific SITE commands. (Even if the code is already there).\n\nSo I implemented a SITE action, which takes a \"sitecommand\" attribute.  The\nresult of the implementation looks like this in an ANT project file:\n<ftp server=\"localhost\" userid=\"erik\" password=\"\" action=\"site\" sitecommand=\"run\n'\\Temp\\TestCore.exe'\"/>\n\nI made a patch to the latest source code in the CVS and it is available at\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/b291533/FTP.java.patch.txt\n\nThis is the first time Ive done an ANT task, so it might have some sever\nproblems in it. It would be very nice to have such functionality in the FTP\ntask, and I hope you will add it. \nSometimes you need to go outside the file gathering and do other stuff.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 34257, "id": 73162, "time": "2005-03-31T23:44:47Z", "creator": "erikmattsson@home.se", "creation_time": "2005-03-31T23:44:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "scohen@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 75594, "time": "2005-05-30T16:42:30Z", "bug_id": 34257, "creation_time": "2005-05-30T16:42:30Z", "is_private": false, "text": "a siteCommand attribute has been added as per your patch."}]
