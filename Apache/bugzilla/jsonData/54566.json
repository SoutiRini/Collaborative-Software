My 1.docx file contains 2.docx as embedded object. When I try to read the 2.docx by saving to disk and when I try to read everything is going fine.\n\nWhere as my requirement is I will read the 2.docx file using packagePart.getInputStream() and I will get the byte array and I will store it some where in the database. Again when I want to read the stored document from byte[] I am getting the below exception ZIPException was caught broken uncompressed file.\n\nI am using the below code to get the extractor:\nExtractorFactory.createExtractor(OPCPackage.open(new ByteArrayInputStream(fileData, 0, fileData.Length)));\n\nRemember I want to read the embedded document(2.docx which is inside 1.docx)using byte[] not from InputStream. Please guide me if I am doing anything wrong here.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nN.Murali Krishna."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "It's probably too long since the original bug-report, but can you provide a sample document that shows this together with all the code that is necessary to reproduce the exception?", "is_private": false, "id": 192658, "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "time": "2016-07-26T19:28:47Z", "bug_id": 54566, "creation_time": "2016-07-26T19:28:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54566, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Not enough information to reproduce the bug.
