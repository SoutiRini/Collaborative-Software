The fix that will work for most copy tasks (using the\n<different> selector) will not work with sync, because of the way sync is\nwritten.  If there are no different files, the different selector will not\nchoose any files to pass to sync.  Sync will then think that their are no files\nto syncronize, and will remove all of the dangling files in the location you are\nsyncronizing to, (causing it to erase all of the files in the target)\n\nI would like to get a fix for this pushed into the main source.  I have\nimplemented one fix that adds a date slop feature to the copy selector.
