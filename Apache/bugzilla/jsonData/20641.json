Since it was special corporate installation, I cannot reproduce this bug\nelsewhere. But other SSL-enabled servers worked there without problems.\n\n  The problem was, that this combination server - client hung just in the of\nloading page. Typical \"Page cannot be displayed\" appeared on the client, server\nhad \"(70014)End of file found: SSL input filter read failed.\" in ssl_error_log.\nI have detailed ssldump data if anyone is interested, but basically it seemed\nthat only one SSL handshake took place, while other clients do multiple SSL\nhandshakes per page (the page contains images etc).\n\n  The problem has been resolved by compiling with MPM=prefork instead of\nprevious MPM=worker.\n\n  I'm putting this into bugzilla just in case someone else had similar problem..."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 34452 ***", "is_private": false, "id": 104265, "creator": "davi@apache.org", "time": "2007-06-09T07:39:58Z", "bug_id": 20641, "creation_time": "2007-06-09T07:39:58Z", "attachment_id": null}]
