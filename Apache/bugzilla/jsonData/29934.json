FileRowColContainer.java uses\na StringTokenizer that does not return delimeters, so multiple delimeters are\nswallowed and treated as one.  As a result, for an input file like this...\n\n,,,\n,,,3\n,,2,\n,,2,3\n,1,,\n,1,,3\n,1,2,\n,1,2,3\n0,,,\n0,,,3\n0,,2,\n0,,2,3\n0,1,,\n0,1,,3\n0,1,2,\n0,1,2,3\n\n...JMeter reads it like this...\n\n,,,\n3,,,\n2,,,\n2,3,,\n1,,,\n1,3,,\n1,2,,\netc.\n\nThe fix should be simple enough if we can merely change the behavior to count\nevery delimeter.  My concern with that is that one could conceivably have input\nlike this:\nSmith Thomas 12345\nDoe   Jane   12346\nThis seems rather unlikely for a couple reasons.  First, I doubt anyone would\nuse this format with the default delimeter of a comma, since it would look like\nthis...\nSmith,Thomas,12345\nDoe,,,Jane,,,12346\n...while it seems unlikely that anyone would use spaces as a delimeter, as doing\nso would cause problems for, say, a snail-mail address, which presumably include\nspaces.  Also, the CSV format is, of course, common, and in my experience, \",,\"\nproduces a blank field.\n\nI'll post a potential fix shortly.
