Hierarchical target\ninvocations can then be more naturally specified in the depends=\"...\" attributes\nof targets.  For example:\n\n    <target name=\"compile\" depends=\"strutil.compile,util.compile\">\n\nIn this case, I need to use something like this:\n\n    <import>\n        <fileset dir=\".\" includes=\"*/build.xml\"/>\n    </import>\n\nCurrently I have to list each build file with a separate <import> task, which is\ntedious and brittle.\n\nI believe this feature would give Ant a powerful and natural way to represent\nbuild dependencies throughout a tree of build files.", "id": 82153, "time": "2005-11-06T00:02:01Z", "creator": "mikecepek@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2005-11-06T00:02:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "mikecepek@yahoo.com", "is_private": false, "id": 82435, "time": "2005-11-13T23:29:18Z", "bug_id": 22269, "creation_time": "2005-11-13T23:29:18Z", "tags": [], "text": "Additional desired requirement:  the <import> task should accomodate redundant\nimports, either by importing each build file only once per Ant invocation OR by\nsimply behaving well (i.e. not generating errors or warnings) when importing a\ngiven build file more than once per Ant invocation.\n\nThis will eliminate messy Ant \"exclude\" logic in many cases.  For example,\nconsider a subpackage which relies on the parent package to import all build\nfiles for that package.  If the Ant invocation started with the subpackage build\nfile, then that build file will already have been read in when the parent\npackage attempts to import all the subpackage build scripts (using a <fileset>).\n\nIt's quite a pain to code each subpackage to exclude itself from the parent\npackage's bulk import of the subpackage build scripts.
