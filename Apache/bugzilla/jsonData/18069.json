Deleting everything in the\nwork directory fixed this and now the tags are frolicking again.\n\nSince enablePooling is something that affects how the .java files are generated,\nit seems to me that if Tomcat realizes that the enablePooling setting has\nchanged, that it should force a recompile of all the jsp's the next time they're\nhit (or whenever). I don't know if this opens up a can of worms (for instance,\nshould it do the same thing if the classdebuginfo setting changes too).
