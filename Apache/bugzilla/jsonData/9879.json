This means the existing code that tries to pass a Category to the \nconstructor can't be compiled.\n\nRealMethods could change their library to work with Log4j 1.2 by switching from \nCategory to Logger, but then it wouldn't work for people who are still using \nLog4j 1.1.  I believe Hierarchy should be able to accept a Category in its \nconstructor; or, failing that, documentation of 1.2's backward compatbility \n(such as http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/download.html) should mention the \nissue.\n\nThanks.", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 19045, "time": "2002-07-05T10:48:26Z", "bug_id": 9879, "creation_time": "2002-07-05T10:48:26Z", "text": "\n\nThis bug cannot be fixed without compromising log4j's integrity.
