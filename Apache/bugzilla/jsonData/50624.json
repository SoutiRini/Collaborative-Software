This patches adds then to mime.types and magic. Also in magic, the patch removes the 'audio/unknown' result for files beginning with RIFF. This is because:\n- It didn't work - if the file contained both the RIFF and WAVE magic string, the resulting MIME type was \"audio/unknown\\210yt\\232r+audio/x-wav\" (also, for the newly added WebP magic, the result was wrong in a similar way)\n- I'm not sure if this was a good idea - the RIFF containers are also used for AVI videos and ANI animated cursor.\n\nThe patch applies cleanly to HEAD and branch 2.2.x. It applies with a small fuzz to the 1.3.x branch, but I'll also post a clean patch for 1.3.x.\n\nTested on Apache 2.2.3 and 1.3.x head.
