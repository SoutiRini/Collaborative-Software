White Area on top of the conversion(PDF) it happen even with small SVG's\n   and it also happened when converting to JPG\n\n   example:\n\n   java  -jar batik-rasterizer.jar -m application/pdf -maxw 250 -maxh 250 -a \n0,0,250,250 -d batikFX-1.pdf batikFX.svg\n   \n   If converting full SVG there are no additional white area's\n\n   Example:\n\n      java  -jar batik-rasterizer.jar -m application/pdf -d batikFX-1.pdf \nbatikFX.svg\n\n2. Conversion of Huge SVG FILE created huge PDF and also huge JPG. \n  When trying to view This File In Acrobat Reader we had problems to view or to \nprint it with more detailes. Our decision was to split the PDF to smaller files \nthat will allow  easier opening by the Acrobat Reader and maybe will allow to \nprint them.  \n  So we tried this option with a JPG and when trying to convert only partial \nSVG to JPG it is working fine and creating small jpg file , \n\nExample\n\njava -Xms64m -Xmx512m -jar batik-rasterizer.jar -m image/jpeg -maxw 1000 -maxh \n1000 -a 0,0,1000,1000    -d Huge_Map-1.jpg Huge_Map.svg\n\nbut when trying to convert this huge SVG to PDF the  PDF file size is stays the \nsame as the regular conversion(Huge file size) \n  \nExample\n\njava -Xms64m -Xmx512m -verbosegc -jar batik-rasterizer.jar -m application/pdf -\nmaxw 1000 -maxh 1000 -a 0,0,1000,1000    -d Huge_Map-1.pdf Huge_Map.svg\n\n\nOur huge SVG file\n==============\nIt is generated according to DB structure of Graph dependencies , it is made of \naround 15000 objects : 5000 rectangles , 5000 text objects , ~5000 lines\nthe width and Height and view Box of the SVG are :\nwidth=\"29210\" height=\"1110\" viewBox=\"0 0 29210 1110\"\n\nAdditional Info\n=============\nThis was tried on Windows 2000 with java 1.5\nand\nOn Unix(HP,SUN,AIX) with java 1.4\n\nI will be glade to send an Example of the file upon request  \n\nThanks In Advance\nAlex Ostar", "attachment_id": null}]
