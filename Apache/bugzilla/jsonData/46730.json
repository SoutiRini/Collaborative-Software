(Also tried 0.94, 0.95)\nI would like to create XSL->PDF documents with enabled security.\n\n-> http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.94/pdfencryption.html\n\nSo, I am creating documents -noprint, -nocopy and -noedit. When I do so, there are now problems with older clients.\n\nAdobe Reader 5.0 for example asks a password. But there is none set. There are also problems on mac-computer, where it asks for a password.\n\nWithout using the security, no password is getting asked. Is this a bug? What could i do wrong here?\n\nRedards,\nConrad Kostecki"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "Kostecki@his.de", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 124924, "time": "2009-02-18T05:52:51Z", "bug_id": 46730, "creation_time": "2009-02-18T05:52:51Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 40557 ***"}, {"count": 2, "text": "Sorry, found the right Bug ;)", "creator": "Kostecki@his.de", "is_private": false, "id": 124926, "time": "2009-02-18T05:53:22Z", "bug_id": 46730, "creation_time": "2009-02-18T05:53:22Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46730, "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs", "id": 156986, "time": "2012-04-01T13:55:57Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:55:57Z", "attachment_id": null}]
