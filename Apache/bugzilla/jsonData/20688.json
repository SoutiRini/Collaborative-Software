In fact, I remember some documention that said this more explicity.   The \ntruth is that the value must actually be incremented, not just changed.  The code is in \njk_config.c ~line 428 \n \nIt seems trivial, but my assumptions based on the documentation caused me a little \nheadache yesterday until I realized my mistake.  If the documentation was a little more \nexplicit ( \"increment\"), maybe another user won't make the same mistake. \n \nThanks!", "attachment_id": null, "id": 38731, "creator": "crozierm@conducivetech.com", "time": "2003-06-11T19:23:23Z", "bug_id": 20688, "creation_time": "2003-06-11T19:23:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20688, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 53210, "time": "2004-02-29T07:16:29Z", "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-02-29T07:16:29Z", "text": "\nThe documentation states:\n\"Every time the config file is read, jk will check the version number in the\ncomponent, \nand reconfigure if it is different.\"\n\nIt's perfectly clear to me.
