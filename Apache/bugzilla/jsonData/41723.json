But it doesn't. The problem is, that req.getInputStream() returns an empty\nstream (although req.getContentLength() returns the correct value). Obviously\nthe InputStream has already been read and transformed into parameters, before\nthe request reaches the CGIServlet.\n\nAm I really the only one with this problem?
