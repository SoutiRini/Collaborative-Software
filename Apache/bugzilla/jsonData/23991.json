In migrating, I was badly caught out by the fact that\nthe telnet task has it's timeout in seconds whereas the sshexec task has it's\ntimeout in milliseconds.\n\nRTFM? I did, but didn't pick up that the units had changed. Given\ntelnet->sshexec is prolly going to be a common upgrade path, it might be nice to\nmake special mention of the change of units for the timeout. It might save a few\ndeveloper hours and a few INVALID bug reports too :-)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 118646, "time": "2008-07-14T07:55:04Z", "bug_id": 23991, "creation_time": "2008-07-14T07:55:04Z", "is_private": false, "text": "svn revision 676611"}]
