Workbook is created \nsuccesfully, but when I open the file using Excel, the following message is \ndisplayed: \"File error: data may have been lost.\" The spreadsheet content is \nOK and the outlines are shown.\nAdditionaly, depending on the data in the file, one of the following, or both, \noccur:\n1. Excel crashes after several seconds\n2. An extra cell is added in the 1st column of the 1st or 2nd sheet with value \n=#N/A. Clicking on this cell sometimes causes Excel to crash.\n\nI have not been able to figure out the relation between the data in the \nspreedsheet and occurence of these errors, it seems to be random;)\n\nI have no problems with row outlines on multiple sheets.\n\nThanks in advance, Jacek", "id": 73907, "time": "2005-04-21T16:09:42Z", "creator": "jacek.bekier@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-04-21T16:09:42Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "avik@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 73964, "time": "2005-04-22T13:18:00Z", "bug_id": 34555, "creation_time": "2005-04-22T13:18:00Z", "text": "Could you please attache to this bug\n\n1.
