For example:\n\nFinalizer does not call superclass finalizer\n\nThis finalize() method does not make a call to its superclass's finalize()\nmethod. So, any finalizer actions defined for the superclass will not be\nperformed. Add a call to \n super.finalize().\n\nClass defines equals() and uses Object.hashCode()\n\nThis class overrides equals(Object), but does not override hashCode(), and\ninherits the implementation of hashCode() from java.lang.Object (which returns\nthe identity \n hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM). Therefore, the\nclass is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal \n hashcodes. \n\nWait not in loop\n\nThis method contains a call to java.lang.Object.wait() which is not in a loop.\nIf the monitor is used for multiple conditions, the condition the caller\nintended to wait for might not be the one that actually occurred.\n\ninstanceof will always return true\n\nThis instanceof test will always return true. Although this is safe, make sure\nit isn't an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error.\n\n\netc.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 41476, "id": 98564, "time": "2007-01-26T09:52:17Z", "creator": "genman@noderunner.net", "creation_time": "2007-01-26T09:52:17Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41476, "is_private": false, "text": "Changes committed against this bug by eross in rev 500382.\n\nSome changes will need to be reverted since they eliminated member variables that were unused by log4j \nitself but were visible formed part of the API.", "id": 98773, "time": "2007-01-30T10:49:35Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-01-30T10:49:35Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41476, "text": "Not going to risk changing log4j 1.2 code for pedantic errors since it would be too easy to break stuff.  \nBetter to do log4j 2.0 right from the beginning.", "id": 107110, "time": "2007-08-22T19:54:18Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-08-22T19:54:18Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
