(bugnum 3503)\n\nI would appreciate it if this gets fixed in xerces 1.4.4 also.\n\nUntil recently, we were using jaxp 1.0 (and sun parser) to parse exactely the\nsame stuff without any problems. After upgradinf to jaxp 1.1 (and xerces) we get\nerrors because the DOM tree is full of (unwanted) '#comment' nodes. \n\nThanks."}]
