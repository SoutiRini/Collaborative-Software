[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "woolfel@yahoo.com", "text": "first off thanks to JMeter developers. I get \"out of memory\" errors when I run a \ntest with the following settings:\n\nthreads: 15\nramp-up: 5\niterations: 300\nsize of html file: 26384 bytes\nmemory setting: %JAVA%\\java -Xmx95m .....\n\nOnce out of memory error occurs, the GUI locks up and does not respond. This \nsystem doesn't have much memory, so I set the maximum. For html pages that are \nsmaller, the test runs to completion. I'm guessing if I had half a gig of memory \nand set the minimum memory to say 128mb and max to like 256mb, I probably \nwouldn't see the memory error. Once I am done with my tests, I am planning on \nlooking at the source to find out the cause. if I find the problem, I will \nsubmit a patch.\n\nthanks again.\n\npeter lin", "id": 9259, "time": "2002-01-02T05:44:44Z", "bug_id": 5658, "creation_time": "2002-01-02T05:44:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5658, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I suspect the cause is use a one of the visualizers that extends \nResultCollector.
