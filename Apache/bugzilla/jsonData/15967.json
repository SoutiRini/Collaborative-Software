Maintenance Review 1 adds IllegalStateException on getId and getLastAccessedTime. Maintenance Review 5 (for 2.5) removes it from getId, but \"leaves\" it on getLastAccessedTime.\nAt least we've won a new definition of \"clearly intended\": \"never present during 5 years of maintained documentation, and render the method useless\". For the \"method useless\" part, see http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6470831 , ain't it sweet to access internal method to circumvent a \"clearly intended\" misbehaviour? All we need now is to mark getMaxInactiveInterval() as throwing the same exception :-)"}]
