[{"text": "When trying to add an LDAP user, you have to add the base DN onto the end of the\nusr-branch property in ldap.properties otherwise it doesn't find the entry. \nHowever, when trying to login with the newly added user it correctly constructs\nthe DN from the usr-branch and the base DN and therefor you get the base DN twice.\n\nAfter looking at the LDAPUser.java I discovered that when adding a user, if\nthere was no usr-branch it was trying to search over the provider URL rather\nthan the base DN.  And when there was a usr-branch is wasn't adding the base DN.\n\nThis is fixed by the attached patch.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndy", "tags": [], "bug_id": 39462, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 88709, "time": "2006-05-02T11:21:52Z", "creator": "A.D.Savin@bath.ac.uk", "creation_time": "2006-05-02T11:21:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 18214\nPatch fixing error in LDAPUser.java", "bug_id": 39462, "is_private": false, "id": 88710, "time": "2006-05-02T11:23:03Z", "creator": "A.D.Savin@bath.ac.uk", "creation_time": "2006-05-02T11:23:03Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 18214}, {"text": "Could any of the committers with an LDAP server please test & apply this?
