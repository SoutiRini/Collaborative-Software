[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "JspApplicationContextImpl sets up a CompositeELResolver with the standard and application-specific EL resolvers. The CompositeELResolver implementation basically just invokes every ELResolver in the list until a value is successfully resolved. The issue is that in certain situations some ELResolvers are called needlessly. For example, if base != null, calling getValue() on ImplicitObjectELResolver is unnecessary. So there are cases in which certain ELResolvers can be skipped over. In EL heavy applications skipping over certain ELResolvers can quickly add up.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 53896, "id": 162267, "time": "2012-09-19T06:17:47Z", "creator": "jgawor@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-09-19T06:17:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53896, "text": "Created attachment 29397\nOptimized Jasper EL resolver\n\nI attached an optimized Jasper EL resolver.
