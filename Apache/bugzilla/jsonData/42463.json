The spec says that access to\nother contexts should be allowed if no security issues demand something\ndifferent, ie. this must be configurable by the tomcat administrator.\n"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42463, "text": "The Tomcat docs already cover all of this.", "id": 145675, "time": "2011-04-10T07:15:16Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-04-10T07:15:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
