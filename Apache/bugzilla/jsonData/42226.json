Let us know if it\nsuits your needs, and this bug can be closed as \"fixed\", or let us know what is\nmissing.\n", "id": 103740, "time": "2007-05-28T01:53:19Z", "creator": "alf@i100.no", "creation_time": "2007-05-28T01:53:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42226, "is_private": false, "id": 105000, "creation_time": "2007-07-02T06:28:11Z", "time": "2007-07-02T06:28:11Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "No response, so closing as fixed.", "attachment_id": null}]
