[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "jglick@apache.org", "text": "CPU profiling of repeated runs of small Ant scripts in the NetBeans IDE (which\nkeeps classes loaded in the same VM between runs) showed a noticeable amount of\ntime being spent in ComponentHelper.initDefaultDefinitions, loading\ndefaults.properties (for both tasks and types) from ant.jar and parsing it. This\npatch caches the result statically in ComponentHelper.\n\nI *think* CH.iDD() is only called once per build, from Project.init() on the\nentry project (not subprojects), so regular command-line usage would not\nbenefit.
