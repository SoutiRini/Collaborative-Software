I read an Excel file as a \ntemplate which also contins formulaes. Then I have to create around 15 Sheets \ndynamically for the report, in the same workbook.\n\nI create the first sheet successfully, and for the next on, I simply clone the \nfirst one. I found that if the template (and hence first sheet) draws the chart \ncorrectly. And for the cloned sheets, it clones the chart as it is, means it \njust places the same view on all the sheets. The reason is that, the value \nrange and series still referes to the first sheet, and does not dynamically \nupdate the sheet reference.\n\nI think this should be a small bug where the sheet name is not provided \ndynamically to the chart values..\n\nCheers - Amol Athavale"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Try the latest POI-3.5-beta4.
