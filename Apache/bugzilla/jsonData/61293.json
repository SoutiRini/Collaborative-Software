While we might debate if this is a good idea or not, I find it extremely powerful for multi-lingual website without having to duplicate file structure.\n\nOne problem I am having is overwriting PHP values. Because I mod_rewrite, Apache seems to lose track of the location and it's impossible to overwrite at this level. See details here:\n\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/857961/php-value-overrides-with-apache-using-a-front-controller\n\nOriginally I thought it was better to do the fix on the PHP side but apparently those restriction are in place because of security/chain of events reasons. See details here:\n\nhttps://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74882\n\nWould this be something that Apache could fix? Maybe new <Location> rules applied before mod_rewrite?", "id": 199762, "time": "2017-07-13T13:02:09Z", "creator": "bouvrette.nicolas@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-07-13T13:02:09Z", "is_private": false}]
