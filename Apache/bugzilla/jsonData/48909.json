However attempting to do an ftp transfer the server cannot be found.  Using a 'test your ftp server' from the web, the report is: 'server found, response incorrect' - the connection is dropped.  Which routine should be patched to correct this ?, do you have a patch list you could email to me ?.\nAlso the httpd file in config has a list of 'load module' directives, changing all to no hash caused a start error, this was traced to 'load module ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so' causing the error. Checking the module folder, no .so routine is present, therefor no 'secure sockets layer' can be implemented.  Not currently required.\nPlease advise.\nRegards,\nAlan W.
