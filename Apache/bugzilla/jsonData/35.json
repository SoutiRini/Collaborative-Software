Instead, the Priority is sent accross the socket as an integer value.  \nWhen the priority value reaches the server, the server creates a Priority \nobject which is then used to obtain a priority name from the received integer \nvalue.  However, the Priority class knows nothing of the additional Priorities \ndefined in the XPriority class, and 'DEBUG' is returned when the \nPriority.toPriority(int) method is called.\n\nAs a result, all logging messages that have a 'custom' priority appear \nas 'DEBUG' on the logging server.\n\nThe logging messages appear correctly if directed to a System.out FileAppender."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 35, "text": "\n\nI am aware of this problem.
