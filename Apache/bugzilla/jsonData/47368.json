Then the site hangs and the cpu become 100% idle. this is a very strange behaviour, we observed that the max httpd connects was going upto 2050, so we increased the maxclients to 3072 (earlier tried with 1024 & 2048). We have tried to increase the RAM of the TOM cat from 1GB to 2GB each, but no significant difference in the behaviour.\n\nServer Dell 2950\nOS REdHAT- 5.2", "id": 127946, "time": "2009-06-15T01:40:35Z", "creator": "aneesha.pant@edelcap.com", "creation_time": "2009-06-15T01:40:35Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
