Additionally,\n    on Cygwin we need the .la files installed to allow DSOs built by other\n    software packages to link against installed DSOs\n     - e.g. mod_dav_svn -> mod_dav.\n    So, disable the latter part of instdso.sh, just like on OS/2.\n\n* modules/dav/fs/config6.m4: Cygwin is a DLL platform too.

Since Apache uses neither, but fits a script\nof it's own devising into this role, said script needs to follow the documented\ninterfaces of libtool, which means not adding additional arguments.\n\nYou might say that libtool is being overly restrictive - perhaps so, but in that\ncase Apache should create and push upstream changes to loosen that interface\nfirst, before introducing a script which requires a looser interface.\n\n\nAlso, it's not really a gross hack.
