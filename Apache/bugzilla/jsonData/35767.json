Ex:\n\"C:\" will puke. It should automatically assume \"C:\" means \"C:.\" but it does not.\nI would suggest a simple test to see if the length of the string is 2, and if\nthe second char in the string is a colon, if so append on a period. Example follows:\n\nif (strlen(filespec) == 2 && filespec[1] == ':') {\n   strcat(filespec, \".\");\n}"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jim@apache.org", "text": "not httpd bug", "id": 106200, "time": "2007-08-02T13:03:09Z", "bug_id": 35767, "creation_time": "2007-08-02T13:03:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
