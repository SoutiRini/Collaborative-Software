I have succesfully installed Tomcat 3.2.1 on Windows 98, but I have seen \nthat the main page of Tomcat says: \"This is the default Tomcat home page. This \npage serves as quick reference guide to related resources and is located at:\n</path/to/tomcat>/webpages/index.html\nBut this page is in directory:\n</path/to/tomcat>/webapps/ROOT/index.html\n\nAnd in the README file of Tomcat says that \"you can declare a relative or \nabsolute directory pathname for de docRoot attribute in the \nTOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml file. But I've seen this file and I don't find the \ndocRoot attribute.\nBut I have found a docBase attribute with value  docBase = \"webapps/ROOT\". \n \nMy question is: are the main page of Tomcat and the README file not updated? \nPerhaps in previous Tomcat's versions this index.html file was in a directory \nnamed \"webpages\", and perhaps the docRoot attribute was converted to the \ndocBase attribute.\n\nI don't think this is a much important bug, but for beginners with Tomcat \nconfiguration like me is a little confusing.\n\nThank you very much.\n----\nJose Ramon"}]
