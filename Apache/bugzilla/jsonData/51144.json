However, the spec says only the first\nglyph is reserved for .notdef, and what happens in MOST fonts doesn't\nhappen in ALL fonts.", "id": 146080, "time": "2011-05-03T11:08:59Z", "bug_id": 51144, "creation_time": "2011-05-03T11:08:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51144, "attachment_id": 26954, "id": 146088, "time": "2011-05-03T12:35:04Z", "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-05-03T12:35:04Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 26954\nRemoved 2 reserved glyphs from the CIDSubset\n\nThis patch seeks to address the fact that the first 3 glyphs are being reserved, where as only the first glyph should be reserved for .notdef."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Patch applied: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1099852&view=rev\nThanks, Mehdi. It's always funny when a bug surfaces that was essentially there since the beginning. For years, we've produced PDFs with three fixed entries at the beginning of a CID subset.
