[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "jason.skipper@vingage.com", "text": "It seems that when a url which has the following characteristics:\nhttp://<host>/<context>/<registered servlet>/<somePathInfo>.jsp\nnamely a servlet url with pathinfo containing the jsp extention, tomcat\nseems to immediately look for the jsp file, then aupon not finding it, \nit errors. According the the servlet 2.2 spec, the servlet mapping should\ntake precidence of the url ending with *.jsp.  Thus for now, it seems that \nno pathInfo can cantain *.jsp. I have pasted below the relavent section of the \n2.2 servlet spec:\n\n10.1 Use of URL Paths\nServlet containers must use URL paths to map requests to servlets. The \ncontainer uses the\nRequestURI from the request, minus the Context Path, as the path to map to a \nservlet. The URL\npath mapping rules are as follows (where the first match wins and no further \nrules are attempted):\n1. The servlet container will try to match the exact path of the request to a \nservlet.\n2. The container will then try to recursively match the longest path prefix \nmapping. This process\noccurs by stepping down the path tree a directory at a time, using the \u2019/\u2019 \ncharacter as a path\nseparator, and determining if there is a match with a servlet.\n3. If the last node of the url-path contains an extension (.jsp for example), \nthe servlet container\nwill try to match a servlet that handles requests for the extension. An \nextension is defined as the\npart of the path after the last \u2019.\u2019 character.\n4. If neither of the previous two rules result in a servlet match, the \ncontainer will attempt to serve\ncontent appropriate for the resource requested. If a \"default\" servlet is \ndefined for the applica-tion,\nit will be used in this case.", "id": 828, "time": "2001-02-23T06:50:01Z", "bug_id": 687, "creation_time": "2001-02-23T06:50:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 687, "text": "also i was configed to use the new ajp13 connectors", "count": 1, "id": 943, "time": "2001-03-02T11:23:05Z", "creator": "jason.skipper@vingage.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-02T11:23:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 687, "text": "I used the web.xml to map the servlets and i used the mod_jk auto-generated \nconfig file", "id": 1070, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "jason.skipper@vingage.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-08T07:09:52Z", "time": "2001-03-08T07:09:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 687, "is_private": false, "id": 1390, "time": "2001-03-19T15:14:22Z", "creator": "marc.saegesser@apropos.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-19T15:14:22Z", "tags": [], "text": "Already fixed in 3.2.2b1."}]
