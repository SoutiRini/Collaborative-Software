Could the same logic be copied over to the HTTP Header Manager control.\n\nThe benefit here is that I am able to read a request in something like Chrome Dev Tools and simply copy and paste not just the lists of Query/Post params but, with this enhancement, the list of headers as well. This would make transferring requests from what is seen in the browser to JMeter much easier and more accurate."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 162733, "time": "2012-10-13T19:22:49Z", "bug_id": 53956, "creation_time": "2012-10-13T19:22:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Date: Sat Oct 13 19:20:52 2012\nNew Revision: 1397931\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1397931&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 53956 - Add ability to paste (a list of values) from clipboard for Header Manager\nBugzilla Id: 53956\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/protocol/http/org/apache/jmeter/protocol/http/gui/HeaderPanel.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53956, "is_private": false, "id": 162734, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-10-13T19:39:06Z", "time": "2012-10-13T19:39:06Z", "text": ": separator has been chosen because:\n- In Chrome dev tools, it is used\n- In Safari dev tools, it is used\n- In Firefox (FIREBUG), network panel shows tab separated name/value , BUT clicking view source shows them : separated\n- In JMeter request headers are displayed : separated in Tree Result"}]
