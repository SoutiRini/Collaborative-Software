Attached archive includes the following;\n\nUpdated documentation in both raw text and .doc format.\nSource code for full example of dependent or linked drop down lists examples.\n\nAlso, plan to include an example in the quick guide that demonstrates how to hide rows on a sheet. The method that should be used to accomplish this is called setZeroHeight() and it was mentioned on the user list that this is misleading as the javadoc simply says this about the method \"set whether or not to display this row with 0 height\". It may also be worthwhile modifying the javadoc to say that this method may be used to hide the row (similar to selecting the row on the sheet, right clicking and then selecting hide from the pop-up menu when using Excel). Have not included that here as I want to wrute test code to check the hypothesis.", "id": 157063, "time": "2012-04-02T15:27:56Z", "creator": "markbrdsly@tiscali.co.uk", "creation_time": "2012-04-02T15:27:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 28539\nQuick Guide - Hiding and un-hiding rows.", "bug_id": 53025, "attachment_id": 28539, "id": 157106, "time": "2012-04-03T14:07:36Z", "creator": "markbrdsly@tiscali.co.uk", "creation_time": "2012-04-03T14:07:36Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 159155, "time": "2012-05-18T09:27:28Z", "bug_id": 53025, "creation_time": "2012-05-18T09:27:28Z", "text": "Applied in r1340042\n\nThanks, Mark"}]
