Using \na \"Satisfy any\" should always allow access if not specified by either \n.htaccess or \"Allow from\"\n\nMichael.", "id": 16096, "time": "2002-05-14T17:15:28Z", "creator": "mike808@users.sourceforge.net", "creation_time": "2002-05-14T17:15:28Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Same behaviour with 1.3.26 on Windows 2000 Professional.
