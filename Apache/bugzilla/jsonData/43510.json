If no\nNameRecord is found, Abort is called with an error message to that effect. \nOtherwise, a \"NamePtg\" is added to the tokens list.\n\nThe cell reference regex is very liberal in order to support future versions of\nExcel. For example, it allows any length sheet name (though Excel 2003 only\nsupports 31-character sheet names); it allows any number of alphabetical\ncharacters as the column reference (Excel 2007 supports 2^14 columns - three\ncharacters); and it allows any number of digits as the row reference (again,\nExcel 2007 supports 2^20 rows - 7 digits)."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "text": "Thanks for this, committed (had to make a few small tweaks), along with a unit\ntest for it", "id": 112631, "time": "2008-01-08T07:10:47Z", "bug_id": 43510, "creation_time": "2008-01-08T07:10:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
