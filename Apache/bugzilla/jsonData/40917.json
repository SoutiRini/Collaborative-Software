Then, when I run Apache's configure, it searches in turn a \nfile named libssl.a, libssl.so, and libssl.dylib (line #10818 in \n2.0.59/configure). As I have not installed the static lib files, configure \nwrongly concludes that 'error: OpenSSL libraries not found'.\n\nWorkaround : configure should also search for a file named 'libssl.sl', in \naddition to the '.a', '.so', and '.dylib' suffixes."}]
