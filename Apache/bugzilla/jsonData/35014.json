I therefore humbly suggest it might be a \nuseful note to include in the docs for 5.5 (and maybe 5.0 too, as a warning \nthat the approach that was previously valid in 5.0 is now invalid in 5.5).  \nAlso, might it be a good idea to include this in future 5.5.x release notes?\n\nBasically, under 5.0.28 I had a separate xml context config file within my \nwarfile/META-INF, that used the nested-tag approach, i.e. <ResourceParams> \n<parameter> </parameter> </ResourceParams>, but this did not work under 5.5.9, \nwhich seems to require the single-tag <Resource/> approach.  I recognise that \nthe JDBC how-to page example uses the new approach, but it makes no comment \nabout the previous approach being invalid, perhaps it would help those \nupgrading if the change was explicitly mentioned?  I say this particularly in \nview of the fact that TC offers several ways to config a context, so it might \nbe helpful to clarify that here is one way that is no longer valid in 5.5.\n\nThe reported exception was \"No suitable driver\" from java.sql.DriverManager, \nwhich is why I did not initially suspect an XML problem.  This is a second \nreason why this is a tricky one to solve without help from the docs."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "It's mentioned in bold (and the examples have been updated) in the 5.5.
