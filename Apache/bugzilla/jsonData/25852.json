[{"text": "In order to explain the error, consider the following situation:\n\n- Install Tomcat 5.0.16\n- Setup SSL under Tomcat.\n- Point the browser to https://localhost:8443/aplic/servlet/test?option=1 (SSL)\n  \n  This servlet does something like:\n\n  HttpSession s=request.getSession(true);\n  \n  So now the session has been created, as it is the first call to the servlet.\n  But just after starting the session, the servlet does something like:\n\n  response.sendRedirect(\"http://localhost:8080/aplic/servlet/test?option=2\"); \n(not SSL).\n\n  And here there is the problem: The session was created under SSL, and now \nthat we are NOT under SSL, when the servlet does:\n\n  HttpSession s=request.getSession(false); // false because the session was \ncreated when we called the servlet under SSL.\n\n Now the session is NULL.\n\nSo the problem is that sessions created under SSL are not valid when these \nsessions are requested from no-SSL.\nThis didn't happen in Tomcat 4.1.27, so I suppose it is a Tomcat 5 bug.\n\nThank you!\n\nRicotta", "tags": [], "bug_id": 25852, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 49924, "time": "2004-01-01T03:31:58Z", "creator": "rh3_sp@yahoo.es", "creation_time": "2004-01-01T03:31:58Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 49925, "time": "2004-01-01T05:08:33Z", "bug_id": 25852, "creation_time": "2004-01-01T05:08:33Z", "text": "If it is the case that this is working for 4.1.27, feel free to re-open this as \na bug in 4.1.27.\n\nThis is by design, and won't be fixed.
