I think\nthat the space for plus replacement should not take place if a decoding just\ntook place.  In a modification we made, we replaced this:\n\nif (b == '+') {\n  b = (byte)' ';\n}\n\nwith this:\n\nelse if (b == '+') {\n  b = (byte)' ';\n}\n\nThat way, the just-decoded plus sign won't be turned into a space, but a literal\nplus sign will be turned into a space.  As far as I can tell, this is the\ncorrect behavior, and corrects a problem we were having storing files with plus\nsigns in their file names in Slide repositories.\n\nWe are using a modified version of SLIDE_2_1_M1_RELEASE on various platforms,\nbut the code quoted above is still present in the most recent CVS versions.", "count": 0, "id": 74147, "time": "2005-04-26T21:55:08Z", "bug_id": 34636, "creation_time": "2005-04-26T21:55:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34636, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 75818, "time": "2005-06-02T20:42:49Z", "creator": "mkalen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-06-02T20:42:49Z", "text": "In August 2004 Unico Hommes performed some refactoring of the org.apache.util \npackage and moved classes to org.apache.slide.webdav.util.
