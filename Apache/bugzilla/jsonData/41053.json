The problem that Meta is indicated\nas being pressed with the right mouse button is only partially fixed.  Testing\nunder JRE 1.6, I get the correct modifier list string when pressing down the\nright mouse button, but it has Meta in it when the button is released. \nSimilarly for Alt and the middle mouse button.\n\nI tried reproducing this in a small standalone program and couldn't, so there is\nprobably still a bug in there somewhere.  (I'm pretty sure I only call\ngetModifiersEx and never getModifiers, though.)\n\nI'm leaving this bug open to track the second part of the problem."}]
