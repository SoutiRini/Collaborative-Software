From now on, POI will no longer ignore this problem; if any record fails to completely read its BIFF data, an unchecked exception will be thrown.\n\nSome modifications were required in BiffViewer since this problem seems to occur with the versions of drawing records that it uses.  Perhaps this can also be cleaned up once those records have been fixed."}]
