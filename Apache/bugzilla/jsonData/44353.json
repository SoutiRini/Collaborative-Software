I have tried to start using the \"uri' attribute on both groups,\nbut things don't work with nested types.\n\nNamely I cannot use nested elements from one namespace, inside tasks defined\ninto a another namespace.\n\n\n[...]\n\nImporting tasks inside a xmlns:B=\"etc\", and importing the types from A without\nusing \"uri\" will work:\n\n<B:createapplication name=\"admin\">\n      <database refid=\"ID\" />\n</B:createapplication>\n\nImporting everything withOUT using \"uri\", will also work:\n\n<createapplication name=\"admin\">\n      <database refid=\"ID\" />\n</createapplication>\n\nHowever using xmlns:B=\"www.B_JAR\", and xmlns:A=\"www.A_JAR\" will NOT work:\n<B:createapplication name=\"admin\">\n      <A:database refid=\"mydatabse\"/>\n</B:createapplication>\n\nHere I will get:  \n\"\"\"B:createapplication doesn't support the nested \"database\" element.\"\"\"\n\nUsing the same xmlns settings, if I pass the database element through a\nreference in an attribute, like in\n\n<A:database name=\"etc\" bootstrap=\"etc\" id=\"mydatabase\"/>\n<B:createapplication name=\"admin\" databaseref=\"mydatabse\">\n</B:createapplication>\n\nthings do work. \n\nSo the namespace import seems to be OK, what is failing is the type resolution\nof nested types.", "id": 113412, "time": "2008-02-04T07:23:04Z", "creator": "borges_francisco@emc.com", "creation_time": "2008-02-04T07:23:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "peterreilly@apache.org", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 44352 ***", "id": 113413, "time": "2008-02-04T07:35:27Z", "bug_id": 44353, "creation_time": "2008-02-04T07:35:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
