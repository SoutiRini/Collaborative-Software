[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50304, "text": "I have my site setup so that it sets a cookie in the root folder.  When I change to a different folder, I need to be able to access the same cookie.  I have found that if I browse to just the folder (eg: /test) then the cookie does not get retrieved, even though in Firebug is shows that the cookie is still set.  My site checks for the cookie and if it cannot find it, then it tries to set it again, so every time I visit /test, it tries to set the cookie, over and over again.\n\nIf however I browse to /test/index.jsp then the cookie shows up just fine.  When I browse directly to Tomcat it works fine as well, it is just when IIS passes the connection over that there is an issue.\n\nI have tried both the 1.2.30 and 1.2.31 dll with the same results.\n\nThanks for the help!", "id": 141852, "time": "2010-11-19T14:29:11Z", "creator": "benthecomputerguy@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-11-19T14:29:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "timw@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 145681, "time": "2011-04-10T16:43:04Z", "bug_id": 50304, "creation_time": "2011-04-10T16:43:04Z", "text": "There shouldn't be anything in the ISAPI redirector (or IIS for that matter) that would alter cookies on the way through (they are just HTTP headers).\n\nI'd suggest the users list is probably the best place to get support on what could be causing this.\n\nIf you can capture an HTTP trace (client -> IIS) and either an ISAPI redirector debug log or a Wireshark (IIS -> Tomcat) trace demonstrating this problem then reopen this issue and someone might have a look."}]
