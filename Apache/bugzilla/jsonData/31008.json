When I try to\nstop the server:\n5. apache -k stop\nI get the error message \"The Apache2 service is stopping. Failed to stop the\nApache2 service.\" If I try to uninstall:\n6. apache -k uninstall\nI get: \"Removing the Apache2 service The Apache2 service has been removed\nsuccessfully.\" However upon shutting down Windows, I get a message box labeled\n\"Apache\": \"You must quit this program before you quit Windows. Click OK to quit\nthe program and Windows, or click Cancel to continue running the program and\nWindows.\" \nIf Cancel is clicked, Apache somehow quits and Windows remains on. Recently I\ndiscovered that after I do the command \"apache -k uninstall\", and call the\n\"close program dialog\" (CTRL+ALT+DEL), Apache is one of the programs that is in\nit and also something called \"Winoldap\". I looked Winoldap on Google:\nhttp://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000456.htm (\"This issue can also occur if\nSystem Agent attempts to shutdown a second MS-DOS session before the first\nMS-DOS session is not closed.\"). \nI have no idea how and why this is happening.
