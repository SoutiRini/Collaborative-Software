When we access this page(http://localhost:8080/sample/Sample.html) and \nwhen we click the link \"Click Me\"(This link is there in the HTML) twice, we can \nsee the same error in the second attempt. This happens if the length of the \nquery string is more. The same works good in Tomcat5.0.16 and does not with \nTomcat5.0.28.\n\nSource of the Sample HTML file that i tried.\n<html>\n   <body>\n\t<a href=\"Sample.html?arg=abc12334232 abc12334232 abc12334232 \nabc12334232 abc12334232 abc12334232 abc12334232 v abc12334232 abc12334232 \nabc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232 abc12334232 \nabc12334232  abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232  \nabc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232 abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232 \nabc12334232abc12334232abc12334232 \nabc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc\n12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc123\n34232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc123342\n32abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232a\nbc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc1\n2334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc1233\n4232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc1233423\n2abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232ab\nc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12\n334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334\n232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232\nabc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232   \nabc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc\n12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc123\n34232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc123342\n32abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232a\nbc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc1\n2334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc1233\n4232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc1233423\n2abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232ab\nc12334232abc12334232abc12334232abc12334232\">\n      Click Me </a>\n   </body>\n</html>\n\n", "attachment_id": null, "id": 69238, "creator": "shivaprakash_sel@rediffmail.com", "time": "2005-01-05T13:52:33Z", "bug_id": 32834, "creation_time": "2005-01-05T13:52:33Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "If you want to use a huge HTTP header (which is not a very good idea, you should\ntry to POST if you have lots of data), then you need to use maxHttpHeaderSize on\nthe connector.
