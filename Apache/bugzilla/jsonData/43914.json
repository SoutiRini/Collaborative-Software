This specification adopts the\n   definitions of \"URI-reference\", \"absoluteURI\", \"relativeURI\", \"port\",\n   \"host\",\"abs_path\", \"rel_path\", and \"authority\" from that\n   specification.\n\nMoving on to RFC2396, in section 3 you can find the start of the absoluteURI \nBNF. If you follow the production you will eventually see that the basic \ncharacters of the individual path components come down to this:\n\n      pchar         = unreserved | escaped |\n                      \":\" | \"@\" | \"&\" | \"=\" | \"+\" | \"$\" | \",\"\n\nBasically, the above says it can only contain unreserved characters and the \ncharacters explicitly specified, all the rest must be escaped.\n\nLook into sections 2.3 and 2.4.1 for the exact definitions of \"unreserved\" and \n\"escaped\", and you will see that none of them include the space character, \nwhich means \"pchar\" doesn't include it, which in turn means \"absoluteURI\" \ndoesn't include it, which means eventually that the Location header can't \ninclude it either. Same goes for many other special characters not explicitly \ncovered by \"pchar\", not just space.\n", "id": 112189, "time": "2007-12-25T21:23:45Z", "creator": "grnch@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2007-12-25T21:23:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43914, "text": "Thanks for the pointer.
