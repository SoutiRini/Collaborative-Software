Unfortunately, popular browsers (Firefox 3.6.15 at least) do not correctly process the rewritten headers.  This breaks completely breaks authentication when multiple WWW-Authenticate headers are sent from a CGI script.\n\nThere is already code to preserve Set-Cookie headers in util_script.c.  Replicating this code for WWW-Authenticate fixes the issue.\n\nThe attached patch implements this fix in the most trivial way.", "id": 144828, "time": "2011-03-08T09:24:55Z", "creator": "alec-keyword-apache.d8a97a@setfilepointer.com", "creation_time": "2011-03-08T09:24:55Z", "is_private": false}]
