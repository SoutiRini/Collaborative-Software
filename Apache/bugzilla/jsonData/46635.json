If there is less data than expected I want to remove superflous slides.\n\nThe attached patch works for me, but it could probably share code with reorderSlides and is missing better documentation and tests.\n\nhave a nice day, David.", "attachment_id": 23202}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "attachment_id": null, "id": 124524, "time": "2009-01-30T06:22:10Z", "bug_id": 46635, "creation_time": "2009-01-30T06:22:10Z", "is_private": false, "text": "It's rather \"hiding\", not a true deleting because the slide data remains, you only remove the reference to it from the Document. \n\nAnyway, thanks for the patch.
