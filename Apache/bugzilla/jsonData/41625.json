When I click 'OK' of course silly Windows\ngoes and terminates the whole server, so that takes it right offline.\n\nI have solved my personal problems by setting MaxRequestsPerChild to 0 again,\nand I'll just restart Windows every day.\n\nThanks for the great application."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "my_thread_global_end is not Apache (sounds like MySQL).
