[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I am encountering infinite loop in FOP and was wondering if there is any \nsolution for it?\n \nThe \"remark\" value is supposed to store up to 4000 characters. And I have to \nkeep them together in a page if the size can fit into the available space for \nthe current page. If the block size is bigger than the available space then \nsupposed to allow the whole block of text to move to the next page. However, \nwhat we are encountering is that the entire block size could be larger than can \nbe contained in a single page and we encountered infinite loop.\n \nIs there anyway to circumvent the occuring of the infinite loop and yet allow \nto keep the entire block text together when it can fit into a page size and \nallow it to overflow into subsequent pages if the block text exceeds a page \nsize ?\n \nPlease help.
