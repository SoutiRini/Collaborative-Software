You have two static \npdf-pages with a link in the first page to the second page. The first page you \ncan call but when you want to go via the link to the second pdf page you get \nthe internal picture from the Internet Explorer open or save the page. When you \nopen the page you get the error the page can't be open. When you try to save \nthe page you get the same error. The error is reproducible. You can call the \npages single over Tomcat, no problem. When you have no security tomcat managed \nthis behavior correct.\n\nThanks in advance\nW.
