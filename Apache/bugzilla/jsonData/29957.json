[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29957, "text": "HSSFSheet removeRow(HSSFRow row) does not actually remove the row, instead it \nclears the entire row. That is not a big problem. I can bear with that. However \nI just discovered that if there is a cell in that row that has a real hyperlink \n(not a formula), that cell will become empty but still will have that hyperlink \nassociated permanently. Besides, HSSFSheet's shiftRows(int startRow, int \nendRow, int n) does not actually shift hyperlinks.\n\nNow, here is the real problem. I have an input binary EXCEL file with ten rows. \nIt has hyperlinks in its second column. So, for example, cell B1 points to \nlink1, cell B2 points to link2, etc., cell B10 points to link10. If I use \nremoveRow() to remove the first 9 rows and use shiftRow() to shift the 10th row \nto the first row. I then output an EXCEL file. Since the hyperlinks in the \nsecond columns actually do not go away with the removeRow() method and shiftRows\n() does not actually move hyperlinks, in the output EXCEL file, B1 (used to be \nB10) now has a hyperlink that points to link1 instead of link10.", "count": 0, "id": 60258, "time": "2004-07-07T18:28:14Z", "creator": "zhaoweiusa@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-07-07T18:28:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29957, "text": "Fixed in r730076", "count": 1, "id": 123619, "time": "2008-12-30T01:25:09Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2008-12-30T01:25:09Z", "is_private": false}]
