This's very annoying if someone must use the reference more than once \nin the test. The only workaround is copying the reference before EVERY \nrequest... Can the scope be extended to the whole test?\nThank you for your attention.\nSincerely,", "is_private": false, "id": 56412, "creator": "xiajiacs@hotmail.com", "time": "2004-04-26T15:02:28Z", "bug_id": 28600, "creation_time": "2004-04-26T15:02:28Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28600, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I think this is user error, not a jmeter bug.
