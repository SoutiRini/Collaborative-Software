I have the\nfollowing:\n\n <ContextManager workDir=\"work\">\n          <property name=\"timestamps\" value=\"true\"/>\n           ..\n           <LogSetter name=\"tc_log\" timestamps=\"${tstamps}\"\n            verbosityLevel=\"INFORMATION\"  />\n\nIf I start up Tomcat, it reports \"XmlMapper: Replace ${tstamps} true\", but logs\ncertainly aren't prefixed with timestamps (the default). I picked timestamps as\nan easily verifiable example, but I can't get anything else (ports, etc) working\neither.\n\nIf property support is indeed broken, it might be best just to comment out the\nfew doc references to it, and defer till 3.3.x. It's nice, but not a big deal..\n\n\n--Jeff", "id": 6934, "time": "2001-10-21T06:04:37Z", "creator": "jeff@socialchange.net.au", "creation_time": "2001-10-21T06:04:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4313, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Sorry I missed this one for Tomcat 3.3.
