[{"text": "Suppose we have two custom tags <my:inner>  and <my:outer>.  The body content of\nthe outer tag is JSP.

Method 2 should never be called!  I've\ndeployed the exact same WAR file on Weblogic 9 and there only method 1 is called.   \n\nThis seems like a bug to me:  Am I missing something?\n\nThanx", "tags": [], "creator": "jorge.williams@inl.gov", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 107168, "time": "2007-08-23T09:23:58Z", "bug_id": 43201, "creation_time": "2007-08-23T09:23:58Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 43201, "is_private": false, "id": 116176, "time": "2008-05-02T14:02:18Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-05-02T14:02:18Z", "tags": [], "text": "I see method 2 called in both cases.\n\nThe code selecting the method is all standard JDK code:\nBeanInfo tagClassInfo = Introspector.getBeanInfo(PropertyDescriptor[] pd =\n    tagClassInfo.getPropertyDescriptors();\n\nAdditionally, I don't see anything in any spec that would require method 1 to be called instead of method 2."}]
