[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi all.\n\nAnother (little) bug concerning whitespace.\nAccording to the XSL Recommendation 7.15.8, if the value of the \nproperty \"white-space-treatment\" is \"preserve\" all white space characters \n(except linefeed) should be converted into spaces; if the value is \"ignore-if-\nbefore-linefeed\", \"ignore-if-after-linefeed\" or \"ignore-if-surrounding-\nlinefeed\" the recommendation says nothing about what to do with the characters \nwhich are not discarded, but I suppose they should be converted into spaces.\n\nThis replacement is not actually done, so in the pdf output there can be \nsome '/t' character, rendered with a sharp (#).\n\nTo fix this, it is enough to provide an \"else\" branch in the two \"if\" \nstatements testing (bWScollapse) and (!bSeenNonWSYet), calling \ncharIter.replaceChar('\\u0020').\nTo avoid losing time with replacements of a space with an identical space, \nanother \"if\" is needed, testing whether the current character is already a \nspace, but this involves storing the current character in a char variable \ninstead of calling charIter.nextChar() in the \"switch\" statement.\n\nThis is not a critical bug, and using XML + XSLT input it is likely that xml's \nwhite space default treatment avoids these problems, but they could arise \nusing FO input files.\n\nBye\n    Luca", "attachment_id": null, "id": 54819, "creator": "lfurini@cs.unibo.it", "time": "2004-03-29T16:45:59Z", "bug_id": 28021, "creation_time": "2004-03-29T16:45:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28021, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 54860, "time": "2004-03-30T09:30:35Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-30T09:30:35Z", "text": "Hi Luca,\n\nthanks for your observations.
