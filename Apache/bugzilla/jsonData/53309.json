Examining a file created by Excel 2016 with an image in the header, I see it is _still_ using a \n\n<legacyDrawingHF r:id=\"rId#\"/> \n\ntag and related VML reference for header images, even though VML has been deprecated since the beginning of the OOXML specs.  There is only limited support for these relations in POI at the moment, and no clean way to do what this issue wants.  It will require some new XSSF code to cleanly manage the image and relations, and getting the VML right will likely be a matter of hard-coding some text and limiting the flexibility for now.\n\nNot worth my time atm, maybe later if no one else finds it an interesting and worthwhile problem.", "id": 197731, "time": "2017-03-17T01:34:20Z", "bug_id": 53309, "creation_time": "2017-03-17T01:34:20Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
