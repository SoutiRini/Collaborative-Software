How does this advisory apply to Apache Server 2.2.6?\n\nMore specifically:\n\n- Can DTLS be used in the context of Apache Server? If yes - what needs to be done to enable it?\n- Is SSL_get_shared_ciphers() method being used directly/indirectly by the Apache Server code?\n\nThank you,\nSasha.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "First of all bugzilla is no user support forum but for reporting bugs.
