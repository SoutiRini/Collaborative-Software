I tested it with any tomcat\nVersion 3,4,5 (it is all the same).\n\n(Ok, it is not very important because of bad style not using namespaces, but I\nsumble across it from a real scenario using a foreign class)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/faq/classnotfound.html", "attachment_id": null, "id": 50131, "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "time": "2004-01-06T14:19:31Z", "bug_id": 25923, "creation_time": "2004-01-06T14:19:31Z", "is_private": false}]
