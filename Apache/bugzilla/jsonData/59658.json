Under some circumstances the last-modified date is removed (during mod_include processing for example) or not provided at all. The CacheIgnoreNoLastMod directive provides a way to specify that documents without last-modified dates should be considered for caching, even without a last-modified date. If neither a last-modified date nor an expiry date are provided with the document then the value specified by the CacheDefaultExpire directive will be used to generate an expiration date.\n\ncaching.html:\nIf the response has a status of 200 (OK), the response must also include at least one of the \"Etag\", \"Last-Modified\" or the \"Expires\" headers, or the max-age or s-maxage directive of the \"Cache-Control:\" header, unless the CacheIgnoreNoLastMod directive has been used to require otherwise.\n\n\n\n    else if (r->status == HTTP_OK && lastmods == NULL && etag == NULL && (exps\n            == NULL) && (dconf->no_last_mod_ignore == 0) && !control.max_age\n            && !control.s_maxage) {\n        /* 200 OK response from HTTP/1.0 and up without Last-Modified,\n         * Etag, Expires, Cache-Control:max-age, or Cache-Control:s-maxage\n         * headers.\n         */\n        /* Note: mod-include clears last_modified/expires/etags - this\n         * is why we have an optional function for a key-gen ;-)\n         */\n        reason = \"No Last-Modified; Etag; Expires; Cache-Control:max-age or Cache-Control:s-maxage headers\";\n    }\n\nNot really clear if this is a docs bug or not, but I lean towards doc.", "id": 191374, "time": "2016-06-02T17:49:11Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-06-02T17:49:11Z", "is_private": false}]
