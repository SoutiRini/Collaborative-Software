I also didn't know whether this was a tomcat or apache issue.\n\nBasically, I'm using apache 2.2 with tomcat 6. I'm also using ProxyPass to make\nlife a bit easier.\n\nHowever, when I store session data it gets wiped after what seems to be\nhyperlinking to a new page. When I remove apache and use tomcat directly all is\nwell. To make it as simple as possible to recreate the fault below is some\nexample code that fails on the final hyperlink file, and I've missed out all the\nobvious stuff like html tags, etc. This example uses form beans, but fails just\nthe same when simply writing directly to the session object.\n\nindex.jsp:\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"BeanProcess.jsp\">\n  <input type=text name=username />\n  <input type=submit name=submit/>\n</form>\n\nBeanProcess.jsp:\n<jsp:useBean id=\"user\" class=\"com.neil.BeanFormTest\" scope=\"session\"/>\n<jsp:setProperty name=\"user\" property=\"*\"/> \nusername is set as \n<jsp:getProperty name=\"user\" property=\"username\" />\n<a href=\"BeanProcessShow.jsp\">Continue to show data</a>\n\nAt this point, the username is output ok. Then clicking the hyperlink:\n\nBeanProcessShow.jsp\n<jsp:useBean id=\"user\" class=\"com.neil.BeanFormTest\" scope=\"session\"/>\nName: <jsp:getProperty name=\"user\" property=\"username\" />\n\n\nAt this point, the whole of the session data is wiped. Using session object\ndirectly produces exactly the same fault.\n\nIf I stop apache and run tomcat by itself, all is well."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44117, "text": "This works for me so most likely this is a configuration issue.
