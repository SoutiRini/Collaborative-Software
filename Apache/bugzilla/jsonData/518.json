We should add support so that we do not fail on such such occurence.\n\nEmail from Bill Haneman:\n\n\nI have had a look at altGlyph.  Fun stuff but very\ncomplex, lots of fall-back behavior.  Actually supporting\nit requires support for SVG fonts, external fonts via\nCSS, etc.\n\nI think that if we can change the bridge so that\nwe don't choke when SVG font elements are present\n(and just ignore them or create dummy elements)\nthen we can do a much nicer thing and treat altGlyph\nelements just like tspans.  This is in fact what the spec says\none should do if the alternate glyphs are not available/\nrealizable for some reason... an altGlyph element contains\nunicode characters which are substituted with alternate\nglyphs *if available*, the interim solution would be\nto use default fonts in place of SVG fonts or externally\nreferenced fonts, just rendering the unicode characters\nin the normal way.\n\nPerhaps you could discuss this level of support for the\nfont element (creating a do-nothing element) with Stephane \nor Thierry?  Or maybe I could do a trivial implementation of \nSVGFontElementBridge."}]
