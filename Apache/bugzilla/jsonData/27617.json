Further, the web.xml file omits an entry for \"PPS\"\n(power-point show) files.\n\nDetails: I hit problems while attempting to provide access to powerpoint files\nusing Tomcat 5.0.28.  That version is distributed with these lines in web.xml:\n\n    <mime-mapping>\n        <extension>ppt</extension>\n        <mime-type>application/powerpoint</mime-type>\n    </mime-mapping>\n\nI compared the mime-types with entries in Apache 2.20 mime.types file,\nwhere I find only this:\n\n    application/vnd.ms-powerpoint        ppt\n\nBased on my tests, Firefox works fine with the application/powerpoint\nentry, but IE does not.  IE seems to require the\napplication/vnd.ms-powerpoint variation, and Firefox accepts that as\nwell.  I used the following to replace what is shown above with good results:\n\n    <mime-mapping>\n        <extension>ppt</extension>\n        <mime-type>application/vnd.ms-powerpoint</mime-type>\n    </mime-mapping>\n    <mime-mapping>\n        <extension>pps</extension>\n        <mime-type>application/vnd.ms-powerpoint</mime-type>\n    </mime-mapping>\n\nPlease consider using these entries in the web.xml distributed with Tomcat.\n\nI do not have Visio, so could not test the behavior of IE on a Visio file, but\nthat probably should be checked as well.\n\nI contacted Scott Pontillo, the original reporter of this bug, and he made the\nfollowing suggestion:\n\n>    As a longer-term solution to this problem, maybe it would be good to\n>establish a process for importing the entries from the native Apache\n>server periodically? It seems they are kept more up-to-date for that\n>product...\n\nI've taken it upon myself to reopen the bug since it is easily reproducible and\nseems like such a minor issue.  I apologize if this was premature.  Thanks for\nlistening.
