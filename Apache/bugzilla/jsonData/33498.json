The function returns true (i.e. as if it succeeded) even\nwhen it actually fails to move/rename the folder because of insufficient\npermissions.\n\nTo reproduce:\nCreate a directory in the repository and set the permissions such that a\nspecific user can only read from that resource.\nThen create a WebdavResource object for that user pointing to the directory you\njust created. Call the moveMethod. The functions returns true even though it fails."}]
