Google has not been of any \nhelp. In the bugs database, only reference I found was to check on the tomcat \nusers list, not sure what to fix there. I did add the account that 'tomcat' is \nrunning under in tomcat-users.xml but didn't help.\n\nSeems like tomcat is missing the context path for jsp-examples, where would I \ncheck that? Shouldn't that be alreday defined in the default configuration \nfiles.\n\n\nPlease advise, I am really frustrated.
