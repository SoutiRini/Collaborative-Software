Since the HTTP-Host-Header didn't\nchange its value, i guess that the AJP protocol defines a way to send the\nservername _and_ the host-header. This worked fine with apache 1.3, tomcat 4.1.\n\nNow, i'm using Tomcat 5.5.9 and Apache 2.0. I have defined a VirtualHost with\nthe ServerName \"abc\" and the ServerAlias \"def\" in Apache. In Tomcat, there's a\nhost called \"abc\" without any alias. The UseCanonicalName-option is turned on.\n\nIf i surf to http://abc/, everything works. When i try http://def/, it doesn't\nwork. Tomcat searches for a host/alias called \"def\" which isn't there.\n\nit seems that the AJP-Connector only uses the http-host-header instead of the\nseperate filed defined by AJP (which i assume exists).", "id": 77886, "time": "2005-08-01T07:37:25Z", "bug_id": 35957, "creation_time": "2005-08-01T07:37:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 35957, "text": "Set useIPVHosts=\"true\" on the <Connector> element for TC 5.5.10+ will do what \nyou want.", "id": 77888, "time": "2005-08-01T08:02:14Z", "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "creation_time": "2005-08-01T08:02:14Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
