The Server has Problems on \ndownloading binary files including images. HTML files are working without \nproblems. The behaviour is very indeterministic. Sometimes it downloads a file \nperfectly, sometimes I get garbled data and most of the time Apache simply \nstops working. After that, shutting down the service won't work. A runaway \napache process still remains running.\n\nI have also expirienced this problems not only with GET-requests but also with \nmod_dav's PROPFIND-requests. A PROPFIND on a binary file does not work.\n\nThe same tests are working perfectly under Linux.\n\n\n"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "lundensare@hotmail.com", "text": "I  also have this problem.
