Previously I used a folder name with spaces in-between. When I\nrenamed the folder and removed the spaces in the name, it is working fine.\nNot getting any security exceptions. The problem was due the blank space in\nthe folder name.\n\n\nOther details are given below..\nI starter the rasterizer using the cmd \njava -jar batik-rasterizer.jar <svg file name >. The below is the version\ndetails of my java\njava version \"1.4.0_01\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.0_01-b03)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.0_01-b03, mixed mode)\n\nThanks\nPC"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I tried to reproduce this problem but I didn't have any problem:\n    mkdir \"test dir\"\n    cd \"test dir\"\n    unzip ../batik-1.6.zip\n    cd batik-1.6\n    java -jar batik-rasterizer.jar samples/anne.svg\n\nI even tried renaming the batik-1.6 directory to \"batik 1.6\" and it\nstill worked.
