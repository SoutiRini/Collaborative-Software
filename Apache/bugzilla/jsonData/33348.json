POI HSLF classes should be using a license which is compatible with Batik's (Apache License 2.0 [1]). Without that I imagine it will be pretty hard...\n 2. You'll need to post your code for review (probably by attaching a patch into this bug);\n 3. If a Batik committer finds it interesting, you'll need to sign the agreement with Apache on contributing source code (but that can be left for afterward).\n\n\nHope this helps,\n Helder\n\n\n[1] http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/license.html", "id": 128577, "time": "2009-07-07T01:43:37Z", "bug_id": 33348, "creation_time": "2009-07-07T01:43:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to comment #6)\n>  2.
