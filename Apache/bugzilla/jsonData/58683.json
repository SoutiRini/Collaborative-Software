I suggest that if overwrite is off, the task should check to see whether the link itself exists (with File.exists() and Files.isSymbolicLink()), and if it does exist, then do nothing."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jaikiran@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 202664, "time": "2017-12-09T07:58:16Z", "bug_id": 58683, "creation_time": "2017-12-09T07:58:16Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I have submitted a PR https://github.com/apache/ant/pull/49 containing a fix for this issue."}]
