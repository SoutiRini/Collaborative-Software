Something like this:\n\n  Alias /ba /home/ba/public_html\n  Alias /intern/ba home/ba/private_html\n  Alias /tel /home/tel/public_html\n  Alias /intern/tel /home/tel/private_html\n\nIt works as expected in a non-SSL environment. When opening the URL\n  http://my.server/ba\nApache automatically redirects me to \n  http://my.server/ba/\nand opens any index-page it finds there.\n\ndoing the same in an SSL Server seems to return garbage, when omitting the \ntrailing slash in the browser URL line.\n\nRequesting \n  https://my.server/ba/\nworks, while\n  https://my.server/ba\ndoes not redirect me correctly, but the browser displays me an error \nmessage, variing from browser to browser.\n\nIE: the usual unhelpful \"Server or DNS not found\"\nOpera/Win32: \"Access to this port is disabled for security reasons\"\nMozilla/Win32: \"The connection to my.server:80 has terminated unexpectedly.\n                Some data may have been transfered.\"\n\nThe last error message seems to point in the right direction. I've been \nredirected to \"my.server:80\", which is the non-SSL-port.\n\nWhen entering a *non-aliased* https-URL without the trailing slash, the redirect\nworks as expected, only when using aliases, something breaks.\n\nApparently the \"adding-the-trailing-slash\"-redirect does not work correctly\non aliased URLs on HTTPs-servers.\n\nUsed Software:\n\"Apache/1.3.26 Ben-SSL/1.48 (Unix) Debian GNU/Linux\" on Debian Woody\non a Xeon platform."}]
