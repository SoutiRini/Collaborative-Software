I agree that it can be problematic, such as possible overwriting of files.  Then again, anyone using this feature is doing it for special reasons and is likely to have read the documentation and understand the risks involved.  And I'm ok with the fact that \"/context\" gets deployed as a context itself, in addition to \"/context/path\".  This allows for serving common files related to the /path application as well as other applications that might exist under /context.  More on that below...\n\nOne nice thing about this concept is that one can organize multiple related, but separate, webapps under a common path within a host.  For example, I can have...\n\n/myapps/index.html (linking to the various apps in this path)\n/myapps/app1\n/myapps/app2\n/myfriendsapps/index.html (linking to the various apps in this path)\n/myfriendsapps/app1\n/myfriendsapps/app2\n\nI put the /myapps/... structure under webapps and put myapps#app1.xml and myapps#app2.xml in the localhost conf directory.  Seems to work just fine.  The only problem is it is not possible to hot-deploy this.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is the concept of uber-wars (my own term).  That is, a WAR file containing other WAR files or directory structures representing multiple contexts within a common context.  This would allow for hot deployment of these multi-path applications.  So...\n\nmyapps.war\n - index.html\n - app1.war\n - app2.war\n\nOR\n\nmyapps.war\n - index.html\n - app1\n - app2\n\nA multi-path-named WAR file would be rare in this scenario, unless the multipath was 3 levels deep, though it could be supported.  For instance...\n\nmyapps#mysubcontext.war\n - index.html\n - app1.war\n - app2.war\n\nWould result in...\n\n/myapps/mysubcontext/index.html\n/myapps/mysubcontext/app1\n/myapps/mysubcontext/app2\n\nBasically, WARS with WEB-INF in the root of the WAR file would be treated in the standard way and those with nested WEB-INF directories would be treated as uber-wars.\n\nUltimately, if my uber-war concept is rejected (maybe because of lack of official specification?... then again myapps#app1.war is non-standard anyway), then I still think that individual *hot* deployment of myapps.war, myapps#app1.war, and myapps#app2.war should be possible.  As long as the risks are documented, I think it should be ok.  Those doing things the standard way won't ever run into issues and those doing things the non-standard, multi-path, way will have read the documentation in order to have known about said non-standard way and can be assumed to have read the applicable caveats.\n\nHere's my wholly non-biding +1 vote to include this patch and/or my uber-war concept in the next version of Tomcat6.\n\nJake", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 44021, "id": 113944, "time": "2008-02-20T23:30:55Z", "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "creation_time": "2008-02-20T23:30:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44021, "attachment_id": null, "id": 114006, "time": "2008-02-22T01:54:46Z", "creator": "thomas.freitag@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2008-02-22T01:54:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I observed some unexpected behaviour when deploying a webapp using the Tomcat\nClient Deployer (TCD) package and hashes (\"#\") in the deployed context path of\nthe webapp (I observed this using 6.0.16).

For instance, foo#bar.war might have a path as foo/bar/eric/file.jsp.  This is the current way that tomcat seems to work.  Similarly, it might have a file under foo/bar/too/file.jsp, which would be properly served.\n\nNow, if suddenly we allow deployment of foo#bar#too.war, you would assume that to mean any paths under foo/bar/too would belong to the foo#bar#too.war application, and they should all be served under that war deployment.  In which case, you'll run into a conflict.\n\nI'm not convinced that allowing foo#bar.war to be deployed as well as foo#bar#too.war will not cause significant conflicts and errors for some people who deploy conflicting paths without realizing it.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nEric\n"}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44021, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 114529, "time": "2008-03-12T08:29:05Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-03-12T08:29:05Z", "text": "(In reply to comment #7)\n> Really?

Under the current code you can deploy foo.xml, foo#bar.xml and foo#bar#too.xml and it will work (providing the docBases are outside the appBase).\n\nWhat the current code doesn't handle, and your patch needs to fix, is dropping the equivalent wars into the appBase.
