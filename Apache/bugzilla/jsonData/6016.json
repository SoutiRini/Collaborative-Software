The manual says that <chmod> has 13 \nattributes, including \"includesfile\" and \"excludesfile\". But if I use any of \nthese attributes with the <chmod> task, the build fails.\n\nIn my search for a more authoritative reference than the User's manual, I \ngenerated a DTD with <antstructure /> and validated the file wich PASSED the \nvalidation tests.\n\nThe <chmod> element in the DTD has 22 attributes which seem to be a a superset \nof the attributes that belong to <apply>. Many don't make any sense with \n<chmod>. The DTD also allows many nested child elements not mentioned in the \nUser's guide.\n\nSince there are other (better) ways to define an includeslist, this is not a \nlimiting problem.\n\nHelder.\n\n--\nHelder da Rocha\nWeb Consultant\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil", "id": 9871, "time": "2002-01-24T18:07:34Z", "bug_id": 6016, "creation_time": "2002-01-24T18:07:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6016, "attachment_id": null, "text": "chmod does support includesfile and excludesfile (just like apply) for the\nnested filesets.
