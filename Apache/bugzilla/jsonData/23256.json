An error always \noccurs on the very first id attribute, and is not actually repeated in the .fo \nsource (i checked manually).  I have generated a small demo file (.fo)for \ndebugging purposes, and this is located at:\n\nhttp://www.specialistinfo.com/FOP/fop-bug.fo\n\nI ran the command:\n\"c:\\foobar\\fop fop-bug.fo fop-bug.pdf\" \n\nand it spat out the error:\n[ERROR] file:/C:/fop/fop-0.20.5/fop-bug.fo:21:427 The id \"azizacce01\" already \nexists in this document\n\nI also double checked running the same .fo file through another xsl-fo -> pdf \ngenerator (called xml2pdf, from alien tools i think), and this worked fine, \nputting in the links and everything.  (ps. xml2pdf sux!!! - It's really slow \nand doesn't format things properly - Pleeeeease fix fop quick!!!!)\n\nHope this helps you out.\n\nRobin"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23256, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 3497 ***", "id": 44316, "time": "2003-09-18T21:52:55Z", "creator": "j3322ptm@yahoo.de", "creation_time": "2003-09-18T21:52:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 156846, "time": "2012-04-01T13:53:49Z", "bug_id": 23256, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:53:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs"}]
