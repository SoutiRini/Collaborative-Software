These appear as Name and working folder.\n\nUsing Starteam 6 and Ant 1.6.5, if you try to check out a Starteam project, it\ntreats the folder names as \"Name\" and ignores the working folder options.\n\nTo make the GUI layout visually attractive, a project might be set up as follows:\n\nProjectName ( working folder: /ProjectName)\n  Source (working folder: src which becomes /ProjectName/src)\n  Documentation (working folder: doc which becomes /ProjectName/doc)\n\nFor example, we have a project called reports and it gets checked out using the\nfollowing target definition:\n\n  <target name=\"reports\">\n          <stcheckout URL=\"${starteam.server}/${reports.project}\"\n                username=\"${username}\"\n                password=\"${userpassword}\"\n                deleteuncontrolled=\"no\"\n                createworkingdirs=\"false\"\n                rootlocalfolder=\"${root}/${reports}\"\n    />\n  </target>\n\nThe subcirectories checked out at ${root}/${reports} are named Source,\nDocumentation, with all the information on them. On the other hand, the working\nfolders for these folders are \"src\" and \"doc\".\n\nToggling createworkingdirs doesn't make a change (and according to\ndocumentation, shouldn't).\n\nWhen the command line and Java GUI versions of Starteam 6 client is used, this\nfunctionality forks fine. When they are checked out with Ant 1.6.5, they appear\nin incorrect folders.", "id": 79405, "time": "2005-09-05T16:20:19Z", "creator": "hakan.koseoglu@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-09-05T16:20:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "BBurgess@tiaa-cref.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 79449, "time": "2005-09-06T15:16:20Z", "bug_id": 36503, "creation_time": "2005-09-06T15:16:20Z", "is_private": false, "text": "When using StarTeam Ant checkout, you have two options when checking out.
