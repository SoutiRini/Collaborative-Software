[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "purvang@yahoo.com", "text": "Hi\n\nMy Name is Purvang and I am using jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1 release. I have \nconfigured Tomcat as a Web Container itself, meaning that Tomcat is not \nconnected to any other external Web Server and acts as a server itself handling \nall servlet requests.\n\nTomcat is configured perfectly ok and is running fine. The only problems I have \nis while implementiong  \"Session\" in my servlets. I have a servlet say \"First\" \nservlet, that create's an Httpsession using the getSession() method and uses \nthe setAttribute() method to bind/set the object in the session.\n\nBelow is an example code that I write in doPost()/doGet() method to create a \nSession is servlet \"First\":\n\nHttpSession session =  request.getSession();\nString usrid = \"tomcat\";\nsession.setAttribute(\"UserId\",usrid);\n\n\nNow in another servlet, lets call it \"Second\" servlet, when I try to create a \nsession and extract the value that is set in the above code, it throws a \nNullPointerException, meaning that it did not find the session, which was \nsuccessfully created in the First servlet.\n\nExample code in \"Second\" servlet to get the values bound/set in the session \ncreated by the \"First\" servlet:\n\nHttpSession session =  request.getSession(false);\nString test = (String) session.getAttribute(\"Userid\");\n\nThe above line throws a NullPointerException. \n\nPlease help me out in implementing \"Sessions\" using tomcat as  Session is a \nvery important feature and I am heavily relying on it.\n\nWaiting for a fast reply.\n\nRegards\nPurvang", "id": 659, "time": "2001-02-13T02:55:11Z", "bug_id": 589, "creation_time": "2001-02-13T02:55:11Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
