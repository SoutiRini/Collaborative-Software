In short, <fmt:message> tag\ndoes not escape single quotes before passing message text to MessageFormat. This\nperfectly conforms to the specification, however there are two practical\nproblems with this:\n1) message text should either escape single quotes or leave them depending on\nwhether it uses parameters - increased possibility of human error: need to\nalways match these two factors.\n2) migration from Struts <bean:message> to <fmt:message> - natural for many\norganisations - requires going through all messages and escaping quotes in those\nthat have parameters. And what if the migration should go gradually and there is\na possibility that same message is used both by <fmt> and <bean> tags? Then\nthere is no neat solution.\n\nCan you add a configurable escaping of apostrophe sign to\norg.apache.taglibs.standard.tag.common.fmt.MessageSupport class? I.e. escaping\nwould be triggered by context parameter or system property or whatever else?", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39431, "is_private": false, "text": "I've reported this to the 1.2 RI:\n\nhttps://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1744\n\nWe'll be looking to the spec and 1.2 RI for a change here.", "id": 96895, "time": "2006-12-13T16:06:55Z", "creator": "bayard@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-12-13T16:06:55Z", "attachment_id": null}]
