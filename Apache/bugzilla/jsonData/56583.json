Leaving this thread running after web application undeploy will create a classloader leak.\n\nIn addition to that, AsyncAppender uses protected boolean closed field to communicate, that appender is now closed and so Dispatcher thread should stop. But this field is not volatile, set from one thread and is read from another thread. Which does not work and may be one of the reasons of the leak in the first place."}]
