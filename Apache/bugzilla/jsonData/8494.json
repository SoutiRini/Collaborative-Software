[{"count": 0, "text": "Hi,\n\nI am wondering if it is possible to configure multiple level for one logger?  \nFor example,\n\nlog4j.logger.com.mycompany.mypackage=WARN, Appender1, Appender2\nlog4j.logger.com.mycompany,mypackage=DEBUG, Appender3, Appender4\n\nCurrently it appears that log4j only accepts one level, in fact the last one.  \nThis, then, requires the developers to use different logger (or category) for \neach level of logging in the code rather than configuring different appender \nfor different kinds of level.  As such, this might lead to more code changes.\n\nJust a suggestion.\n\nThanks,\nMike Liu", "bug_id": 8494, "is_private": false, "id": 14672, "time": "2002-04-25T00:04:28Z", "creator": "mike@javaexpert.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-25T00:04:28Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\nMike,\n\nCan you please make your request on the log4j-user list?
