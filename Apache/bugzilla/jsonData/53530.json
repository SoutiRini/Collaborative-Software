I had a conversation with bill rowe about this some time ago, and we sort of agreed that we should make the docs conform to a standard of either using quotes or not using them (I lean towards using quotes for directories for neatness sake and for the sake of cases where there's a space in the path).\n\nI'll leave this bug open as a reminder to take a look at how we write our examples.
