Or use syslog. Or\nrotate manually.\nSee src/main/http_log.c .\n\nThanks - Conor.", "id": 35365, "time": "2003-04-16T18:33:19Z", "creator": "Conor@kerna.ie", "creation_time": "2003-04-16T18:33:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19086, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I really don't see what we could do to fix this without severly restricting\nwhat could be used as a piped log program.", "id": 37737, "time": "2003-05-24T17:41:13Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-05-24T17:41:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19086, "text": "True.
