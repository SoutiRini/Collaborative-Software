Most of what they need can be found on XWPFRun and XWPFParagraph, and both sets work with the same objects, RPr / PPr\n\nTherefore, the common RPr logic should be refactored out of XWPFRun and put somewhere so it can be shared with XWPFDefaultRunStyle. Likewise, the same should be done for PPr logic in XWPFParagraph for XWPFDefaultParagraphStyle"}]
