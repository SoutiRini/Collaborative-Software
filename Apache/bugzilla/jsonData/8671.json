The compile is standard with the \nexception that we've included the SSL module... but this does not appear \nto be related to secure server requests.\n\nOn a daily basis we are seeing a single httpd process refuse to die. It \ngenerates a load of 1.0 for itself only, and runs forever stuck.  We can KILL \n-9 the process, and everything else runs fine... until the next one happens.\n\nWe have noted that if we don't kill it (e.g., we don't notice it right away), \nsoon thereafter more are affected (we had about 14 of them stuck \nyesterday, generating a CPU load of 14.0).\n\nWe're on a DUAL PROCESSOR Sun ULTRA (Creator 3D series) - if that \nhelps any.\n\nOne additional note... I put special logging in that logs both the PID and \nthe URL, to see if this happens only on a particular virtual host or site we \nrun - it doesn't appear to... just as it doesn't appear to be related to secure \nserver (SSL) functioning."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8671, "attachment_id": null, "id": 15167, "time": "2002-04-30T18:19:24Z", "creator": "jerenkrantz@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-30T18:19:24Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This looks suspiciously like PR 8165 - which has already been resolved in CVS.\n\nPlease read that PR for more information and its resolution.
