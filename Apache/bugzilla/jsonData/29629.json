[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi, currently I have a project that makes use of DOMParser to manipulate xml \nfile. We do deletion or replacement of nodes to the xml file when there are \ncontent changes. The steps involved are roughly:\n\n1. Check if node exists. \n2. If yes, replace the desired child node or delete entire parent node and \nrecreate.\n\nHowever, sometimes we find that we have missing or duplicated nodes. We \ntherefore suspect that maybe the node deletion or node replacement failed \nresulting in these issues. Pls advise if this is possible.
