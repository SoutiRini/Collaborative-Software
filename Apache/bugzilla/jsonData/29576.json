[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29576, "text": "If a directory has both MultiViews (possibly inherited from a parent) and\nRewriteRules, the MultiView lookup is done before the Rewrite. This can result\nin odd errors.\n\nTo demonstrate:\n1. Create two directories and enable Multiviews in both of them\n2. Create a file in each, with the same stem but different extensions (say,\nA.html and A.shtml).\n3. Verify you can access them as /dir1/A and /dir2/A\n4. Now put in a RewriteRule on dir1 that redirects requests to dir2.\n5.
