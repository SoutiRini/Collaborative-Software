If I'm correct, the test for the .pdf extension should happen first (?)\n\nI am glad you find this patch useful.\nAt first I added this check as penultimate in order to honor the special treatment of PDFs. After that I decided that specifying the protocol has to be with more weight. But I think this is the place for people more involved in the project to decide that particular order.\n \n> Since it does include one new file, we have to ask: \n> Does Apache already have your ICLA on file from contributions to other\n> projects?\n\n The short answer is no. Actually it is now that I understand for the ICLA. I found this addition very small so if it is ok with the community I have no objections to contribute this code without the ICLA.\n If any further documenting is needed to meet any criteria I am willing to do it. After all this will be my first contribution to an open source project. :)\n\n"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "\nHi Alexander,\n\nApologies for the rather long delay. I'm afraid I lost track of this... :-(\n\nI finally found some time to play with it, and it seems that the following would fail:\n\nfile:///path/to/link_target.pdf#dest=name\n\nOTOH, looking closer, this has nothing to do with your patch, I believe. Using an absolute file-URI with a destination appended simply fails. Using a relative URI with a destination always works.\n\nUsing an absolute URI without a destination didn't work before your patch, but using the /Launch action seems to correct this.\n\nI'm inclined to go ahead with the commit. Since it contains one new file, however small, as I mentioned earlier, an ICLA should best be submitted (see: http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas). That is, if you intend on continuing to supply us with patches in the future... I promise, it does not always take this long to process a bug. ;-)\n\nCan you let us know when this is done, so we can follow up?\n\nThanks\n\nAndreas", "is_private": false, "id": 120808, "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "time": "2008-09-19T12:22:51Z", "bug_id": 45113, "creation_time": "2008-09-19T12:22:51Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "I sent my ICLA to secretary@apache.org as a scan.", "is_private": false, "id": 121766, "creator": "astamenov@gmail.com", "time": "2008-10-22T00:58:40Z", "bug_id": 45113, "creation_time": "2008-10-22T00:58:40Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45113, "is_private": false, "count": 5, "id": 121767, "time": "2008-10-22T01:03:42Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-10-22T01:03:42Z", "text": "(In reply to comment #4)\n> I sent my ICLA to secretary@apache.org as a scan.\n> \n\nConfirmed.
