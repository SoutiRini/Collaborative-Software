I get a \"Server \nnot found\" error in the browser. For example, to keep pages in multiple frames \nin synch I submit one frame based on the JavaScript ONLOAD event of the other, \nso the second pages is requested immediately after the first. Using the Coyote \nconnector, this works fine so long as both pages are JSP. If one page is JSP \nand the other HTML, the HTML will display using Coyote, after about a 10 \nsecond delay (with both JSPs there is no delay). Using the regular default \nconnector, I almost always get the server not found error. I tried this same \ncode in WebSphere 4.x, and it works fine with JSP and an HTML page without \ndelay or a problem."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11613, "attachment_id": null, "id": 20877, "time": "2002-08-11T08:43:12Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-08-11T08:43:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I never experienced any problem with frames (like used in the admin webapp, \nbut that's just an example).
