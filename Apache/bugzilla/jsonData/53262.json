The status of your tickets  is NEW which means that no one from the POI team found time to work on them.\n\nOne thing to remember is that Apache POI is a volunteer project. If these bugs are important to you, please do work on them and submit patches! At minimum, post sample Java code that demonstrates the problem.  Ideally that would be a failing unit test.
