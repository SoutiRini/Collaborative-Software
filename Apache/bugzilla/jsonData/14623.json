However,\nsince the call to dispatch() give errCode as null, this results in a\nNullPointerException, the handling of which effectively obscures the original\nException.\n\nMy solution has been to make the call to dispatch() look like this:\ndispatch(null,e.getMessage(),null,e), which seems to fix it entirely.  Please\ncontact me if this is not clear.
