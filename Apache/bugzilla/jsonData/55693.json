Thus one could be led to believe that the saved selection could be included as is. However this is not the case: the include controller will completely ignore anything in the included project that is not child of a test fragment.\n\nOne could argue that it would be better to automatically save the selection under a test fragment so that it is ready for use with an include controller, unless the selection includes a thread group.
