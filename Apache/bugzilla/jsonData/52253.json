In Linux there is no such problem.\n\nmod_proxy_balancer strongly depends on TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions in Windows during balancing resuest to unavailable backend server.\n\nBecause of that fact timeout attribute doesn't work.\n\n\nsteps to redistibute problem.\n\n\n1. Configure mod_proxy_balancer.\n2. Make all back end servers unavailable.\n3. Start httpd.\n4. Send request to httpd server.\n\nOne request to httpd means (TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions +1) requests to unavailable backend server\n\nSo one request can take even 1 - 2 minutes depends on windows xp registry configuration.\n\nDo httpd must depend on Windows registry configuration?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52253, "is_private": false, "text": "Apparently not, I would expect that either WSAIoctl or setsockopt would be\nthe mechanism to alter that behavior.
