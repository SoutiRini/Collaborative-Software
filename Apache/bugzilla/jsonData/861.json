This way, all \nof a set of build.xml's would get the same initial build environment, without \nhaving to duplicate the checks and init's in all build files. \n\nI propose to put an additional attribute in the Ant taskdef to allow the \npreservation of this child environment, and integration back into the parent. \nThe added attribute could be optional and default to \"false\", to avoid breaking \nexisting code.\n\nThis change would further modularize an already modularized project, and could \nhelp take it from a procedural analogy to an OO analogy of a build process."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "Will be discussed in the context of Ant2.", "id": 1096, "time": "2001-03-09T03:18:28Z", "bug_id": 861, "creation_time": "2001-03-09T03:18:28Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
