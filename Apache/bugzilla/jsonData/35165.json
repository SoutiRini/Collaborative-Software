I saw that shapes are painted differently. Obviously, the PDF \nTranscoder tries to off-load the transformations to the PDF interpreter \nwhereas the EPS transcoder let's AWT do the transformation. When I changed \nPDFGraphics2D to use the same method as PSGraphics2D the problem went away. \nI'll attach a patch the does that. I haven't committed that fix to CVS, yet, \nas I have done no extensive testing about possible side-effects and don't have \ntime for that right now. There probably needs to be a discussion how this \nshould be done in the first place. At least you should be able to get your \nexamples working as a quick work-around.
