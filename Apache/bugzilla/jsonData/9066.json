[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9066, "text": "I am using the JAXP SAXParser APIs to parse a huge xml file (600MB). The memory \nconsumption for this is around 1GB whereas if I switch to 1.4.4, the memory \nconsumption for the same comes to around 250MB. I am wondering if there are \nmemory leaks in 1.4.3 or has some feature been added to 1.4.4 that is causing \nthis. The problem is encountered on both Windows 2000 and SunOS 5.8. Since it \nis not easy for me to switch to 1.4.4 due to other dependencies, it would be \nnice to hear your feedback.", "id": 16073, "time": "2002-05-14T13:33:43Z", "creator": "amit.arora@trilogy.com", "creation_time": "2002-05-14T13:33:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
