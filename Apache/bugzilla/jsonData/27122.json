Users access the\nwebapp stricly with SSL.  The webapp's doc area has a few static power-point\nfiles, and that's where this problem bit me: IE users could not get power-point\nfiles.\n\nTo figure out what headers Tomcat sets in responses, I turned on the\nRequestDumperValve in the server.xml file.  Then I saw that every single request\n-- whether .gif, .html, .css, .ppt, or .jsp -- gets \"Cache-Control: no-cache\"\nand \"Pragma: no cache\" in the response headers.\n\nWhile these headers are absolutely appropriate for JSP pages, they are wholly\nunnecessary for static content.  I want my users' browsers to cache static\ncontent like CSS sheets, images, etc. and thereby make fewer requests to my\nserver.  Everybody wins.\n\nThis thread helped me understand the problem:\nhttp://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=233446&start=0&tstart=0 \n\nI finally used the solution from here, with one modification:\nhttp://www.jspinsider.com/content/dev/afessh/another-filter-every-site-should-have.html\nJayson Falkner explains servlet filters that set response headers; this means \nweb browsers will cache items like pictures and other static content.  Note that\nhis code does \"addHeader\" but that does NOT work; you have to do \"setHeader\" to\noverrride the cache-control that Tomcat adds.\n\nI am of the strong opinion that Tomcat needs some configuration setting so users\nlike me can tell the container what caching policy to apply by default.  Maybe\nsomething along the lines of a mime-types file would allow the caching policy to\nbe set based on file suffixes or file-name patterns. \n\nPlease consider this request seriously.  I am not a Tomcat dev and don't want to\nreopen this bug myself.

It occurs with or without SSL,\nand in a wider set of circumstances than invoking IE plugins. (My own variation\nis that download to a file in IE fails if a content-disposition header is set\nand the resource is subject to a security constraint).\n\nThe workaround given by Bill Barker is to configure each context:\n\n<Context path=\"/myapp\" docBase=\"myapp\">\n  <Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.authenticator.FormAuthenticator\"\n          disableProxyCaching=\"false\" />\n</Context>\n\nThis works but reduces security more than is necessary, as it causes no cache\ncontrol headers to be issued at all.\n\nAn alternative workaround\n\n<Context path=\"/myapp\" docBase=\"myapp\">\n  <Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.authenticator.FormAuthenticator\"\n          securePagesWithPragma=\"false\" />\n</Context>\n\nis better. It causes a header Cache-Control: private to be issued in place of\nthe default Cache-Control: none and Pragma: no-cache headers. This tells shared\ncaches not to cache the response, which I think is all that is necessary, while\nstill allowing downloads to work in IE.\n\nHowever, neither workaround is a good solution because it makes configuration\nmore difficult and because it duplicates knowledge of which authenticator is\nrequired between the web.xml and context.xml files.\n\nTherefore I suggest that AuthenticatorBase be changed to put out the\nCache-Control: private header by default. I think this is simply a matter of\nchanging the securePagesWithPragma field from true to false:\n\n    /**\n     * Flag to determine if we disable proxy caching with headers incompatible\n     * with IE \n     */\n    protected boolean securePagesWithPragma = true;\n    \nOther comments in this source file suggest that IE-incompatible headers are\nbeing issued because there is some unspecified problem with Mozilla when\ncache-control: private is used. However I can find no such problem at least with\ncurrent versions of Firefox. Since the choice therefore seems to be between\nworking around a known bug in all versions of IE, and working around a possible\nbug in some previous versions of Mozilla that does not affect current Firefox\nusers, I'd argue that the former is the better thing to do. \n"}, {"count": 17, "tags": [], "text": "The current behaviour is unlikely to change.
