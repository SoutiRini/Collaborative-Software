[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13433, "text": "The problem occurs after editing build.XML to set debug=\"on\" and rebuilding FOP \nwith Ant and JDK1.4. (I required debug on to step into the program using \nJbuilder6.)\nFOP then crashes with a run-time exception, \"No such method\" when rendering an \nfo file to PostScript. The crash occurs in the file PSRenderer.java at line 697:\npsString = (new StringBuffer(\"(\").append(sb).append(\") t\")).toString();\nwhere sb is a previously defined StringBuffer.\n\nChanging this to:\npsString = (new StringBuffer(\"(\").append(sb.toString()).append(\") t\")).toString\n();\nfixes the problem.\n\nNote that Java does not have a method StringBuffer.append(StringBuffer)\nThere is .append(object) which is why the program compiles but this results \nin .append(object.valueOf()) rather than .toString().\nWhat I don't understand is why it crashes with debugging on but not when debug \nis off? I have rebuilt and run FOP several times with debugging on and off but \nalways get the same result; maybe there is some optimization not present in \ndebugging version.", "id": 24177, "time": "2002-10-09T02:25:48Z", "creator": "PeekGM@az1.BP.com", "creation_time": "2002-10-09T02:25:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13433, "text": "Fix committed to the maintenance branch.", "count": 1, "id": 24224, "time": "2002-10-09T19:31:43Z", "creator": "j3322ptm@yahoo.de", "creation_time": "2002-10-09T19:31:43Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 13433, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 156252, "time": "2012-04-01T07:06:50Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:06:50Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
