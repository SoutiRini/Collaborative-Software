[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Project.fireMessageLoggedEvent sets the loggingMessage field to track whether \nBuildListeners are attempting to access System.err or System.out.\n\nThe problem is that if any build listener throws an exception during message \nlogging, the Project is left in an incorrect state. Any subsequent attempts to \nlog a message results in the \"... - infinite loop terminated\" error \nmessage...even though no infinite loop is occurring.\n\nWe are hitting this with Eclipse's Ant integration. One of the build listeners \nwe use facilitate the user to cancelling a build. This build listener throws \nan \"operation cancelled exception\" which is handled etc. but we can do no \nfurther logging.\n\nI would propose that a try/finally block be introduced so that it is ensured \nthat loggingMessage is set to false on exit of the method.\n\nThanks", "is_private": false, "id": 40123, "creator": "Darin_Swanson@us.ibm.com", "time": "2003-07-07T23:45:22Z", "bug_id": 21386, "creation_time": "2003-07-07T23:45:22Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 21386, "is_private": false, "id": 40132, "time": "2003-07-08T00:33:46Z", "creator": "conor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-07-08T00:33:46Z", "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in CVS - thanks"}]
