Presumably this occurs on all 64-bit versions of Windows.\n\nA good solution for this would be to comply with Windows conventions and install data in \"\\ProgramData\" instead of \"\\Program Files\" or \"\\Program Files (x86)\". Things like logs, configuration files, etc really should be installed there. Doing so would also avoid the problem of (x86) creeping into the folder name and triggering this bug.\n\nGenerally, you would want to setup data and logs in the Windows Known Folder '%ALLUSERSPROFILE%' or '%ProgramData%'.
