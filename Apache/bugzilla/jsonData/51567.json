[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "jonwilmoth@yahoo.com", "text": "The http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html docs do a great job of defining the priority of classloaders for a deployment where CATALINA_HOME is the same as CATALINA_BASE.  Through some experimentation it appears CATALINA_BASE/lib is also searched for classes.  It would be nice to see the docs reflect the additional location(s) searched and the order in which they are.  For example will CATALINA_BASE/lib/some-classes.jar take precedence over CATALINA_HOME/lib/some-classes.jar?", "id": 148228, "time": "2011-07-27T18:20:34Z", "bug_id": 51567, "creation_time": "2011-07-27T18:20:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51567, "is_private": false, "id": 148273, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-07-29T12:53:14Z", "time": "2011-07-29T12:53:14Z", "text": "BASE takes priority over HOME.\nclasses take priority over JARs.\n\nI have updated the docs to reflect this.
