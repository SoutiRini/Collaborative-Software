[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "XML-style JSP tags, such as <jsp:scriptlet>code</jsp:scriptlet> or \n<jsp:expression>expr</jsp:expression> are not supported by Jasper. I have read \nseveral popular books that, like the JSP specifications, list those tags as part \nof the JSP standard.\n\nI checked the most recent version of Jasper, and that support is not there.\nThe reason to use XML-style tags is that it makes the code easier to format \nusing, for example, Emacs in xsl-mode. The indentation of nested tags is handled \nautomatically with XML-style tags.\n\nI have a custom version of org/apache/jasper/compiler/Parser.java that \nis extended to support the <jsp:scriptlet> </jsp:scriptlet> syntax in addition \nto the default <% %>. The required changes are localized only to Parser.java \nfile. It took me about 15 minutes to do it, but would take under 5 for the next \none (or for someone who is familiar with the code.)
