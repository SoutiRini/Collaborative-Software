So I modified the existing Get.java to add the timeout option.  I wanted to share this with the ant community so I am including a patch that has my changes (made against the 1.7.0 source code).  To use simply add the \"timeout=#\" to the get tag (# is the number of seconds before the get operation it timed out).  I hope this is useful.  This patch is Java 1.4.2 compatible."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "your patch will only work if the download is actually writing to the stream.
