At the moment I need to either add the if controller as a child or parent, move the child elements of the simple controller to the if controller and then remove the simpler controller. It would be much more convenient to add e.g. a \"Convert to..\" context menu option, sampler to the \"Add Parent\" context menu option. \n\nRegards,\nNoel"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 151677, "time": "2011-11-21T00:24:28Z", "bug_id": 46921, "creation_time": "2011-11-21T00:24:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "It's easy enough to add a new sampler and delete the old one.\n\nHowever, replacing a Controller with many children is not as easy.\nImplemented in SVN:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1204302&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 46921 - Add Ability to Change Controller elements\n\nAdded:\n   jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/ChangeParent.java   (with props)\nModified:\n   jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/ActionNames.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/util/MenuFactory.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/resources/messages.properties\n   jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml"}]
