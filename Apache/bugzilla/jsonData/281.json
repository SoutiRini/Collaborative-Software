I think a lot of people shy away from WARs partially because it would involve stopping and starting Tomcat.\r\n\r\nI like WARs though because they would make the deployment much easier.  Also, this would allow ISP's to more easily allow a deployment interface where administrators could upload a WAR archive and have it automatically deployed...\r\n\r\nIf it is decided that this would be a good thing to implement, I would like to help out.
