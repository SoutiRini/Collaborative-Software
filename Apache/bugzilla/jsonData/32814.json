It is a secure cookie that is digitally signed.\n\nWhen my browser has that cookie, I can no longer connect to Tomcat through SSL.  If I manage the \ncookies and remove that one cookie, I can once again connect to Tomcat through SSL.  Throughout \nthis, I can connect to Tomcat when I don't use SSL.\n\nI can't find any debugging or logging information about what is happening.  It's like the browser no \nlonger reaches Tomcat.\n\nSafari says The error was: \u201cbad server response\u201d (NSURLErrorDomain:-1011).\nAlso cannot connect with Netscape 7.02.   It simply says the document contains no data.\n\nI set the debugging level to 4 everywhere in server.xml and enabled the request dumper, but I still \ncannot see any sign that the request reaches Tomcat.\n\nThanks for your help.\n==Leonard"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 69179, "creation_time": "2005-01-03T19:25:30Z", "time": "2005-01-03T19:25:30Z", "bug_id": 32814, "text": "If the request reached Tomcat, the RequestDumperValve would show its details.  \nIf the request doesn't reach Tomcat, it's not a Tomcat problem.
