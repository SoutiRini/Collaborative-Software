The current code sets an absolute line width in the AFP output when it should set a relative multiplier of the default line width. The end result is that the line width is different at different renderer resolutions. This patch fixes that and also adds support to fractional line widths. Since the default line width is device dependent this patch also adds a new optional entry to fop.xconf, line-width-correction (under the afp renderer element), so that the line width output can be manually tuned to a particular device (printer, viewer)."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53242, "attachment_id": 28790, "is_private": false, "id": 159095, "time": "2012-05-16T13:58:40Z", "creator": "lmpmbernardo@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-05-16T13:58:40Z", "text": "Created attachment 28790\nsupporting material\n\nThe attached files include an example, and two AFP output files (at 300dpi and 2880 dpi) before and after the patch is applied.
