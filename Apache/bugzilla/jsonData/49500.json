[{"text": "We are getting proxy timeout due to using reverse proxy running Primavera web services using Apache 2.0.59 as the web server.  We sent the issue to Primavera support and they have indicated that this is an Apache bug 37770.  I would like to understand the extent of Apache bug 37770 and is it present in this version of Apache 2.0.59 and is it fixed in 2.0.63?  Are there any configuration changes we can make which would reduce or resolve the frequency of these proxy timeouts?\n\nI don't know why our original application was installed on 2.0 in 2007, however if we were to upgrade the latest of Apache 2.2, what differences can we expect to configure to get the same compatibility as 2.0?\n\nThank you for whatever help you can give.\n\nTuyen.", "tags": [], "creator": "tuyen.nguyen@teradyne.com", "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 137889, "time": "2010-06-25T07:33:47Z", "bug_id": 49500, "creation_time": "2010-06-25T07:33:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Bugzilla is for reporting bugs, not for discussion or support.
