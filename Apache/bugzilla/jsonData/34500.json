I want to create a fileset or something similar that will allow me \nto specify files from multiple directories (not necessarily with the same base \ndirectory e.g. some files on C: some on G: etc).  Currently I can't see a way \nto do this because the fileset needs a dir attribute as the base directory.\nI realise that a path allows something like this but I can't use paths because \nI need to copy the files and copy does not support paths."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "There are some more details of the issue I encountered at:\nhttp://www.experts-\nexchange.com/Programming/Programming_Languages/Java/Q_21390310.html", "is_private": false, "id": 73762, "creator": "stefangoor@gmail.com", "time": "2005-04-18T13:11:01Z", "bug_id": 34500, "creation_time": "2005-04-18T13:11:01Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34500, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 73763, "time": "2005-04-18T13:19:38Z", "creator": "phil.weighill-smith@volantis.com", "creation_time": "2005-04-18T13:19:38Z", "text": "Could you use multiple <filelist/>s or <fileset/>s instead?"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "(In reply to comment #2)\n> Could you use multiple <filelist/>s or <fileset/>s instead?\n\nNot really, I need to group together a number of jar files that can be found \non a number of different drives.  This collection of jars then needs to be \nused in the classpath for compilation and copied to a directory for packing \ninto a .ear file.\n\nBecause there are so many of these jars and many possible locations, it is not \nreally appropriate to have multiple filesets.  Also the location of the jars \nfrequently changes depending on which version are being used i.e. released, \nbeta etc.\n\nThanks,\nStefan\n\n", "attachment_id": null, "id": 73789, "creation_time": "2005-04-19T09:49:33Z", "time": "2005-04-19T09:49:33Z", "creator": "stefangoor@gmail.com", "bug_id": 34500, "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34500, "attachment_id": null, "id": 73791, "time": "2005-04-19T11:38:30Z", "creator": "stevel@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-04-19T11:38:30Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Short term, I'd suggest NTFS mount points as a workaround: mount your secondary\ndrives under the main one, so they do all have a common root."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "jglick@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 18128 ***", "id": 73833, "time": "2005-04-19T20:58:15Z", "bug_id": 34500, "creation_time": "2005-04-19T20:58:15Z", "attachment_id": null}]
