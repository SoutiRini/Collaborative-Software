Perl CGI script that\nwrites some debugging information to stderr. Sometimes it hangs on that very\nthing, writing to stderr -- if I run strace this is what I see on the script:\n\nam@croco:/home/httpd> sudo strace -p 12038\nwrite(2, \"Web::Page::parse - path=\\'/bits/m\"..., 54\n\nAt the same time, apache that forked off that perl script:\n\nam@croco:~> sudo strace -p 12019\npoll(\n\n\nIf I wait long enough apache gets (I guess) an alarm and breaks out of that poll\nwith EINTR, then sometimes it hangs again sometimes works fine through the end\nof that script.\n\nThe same script always hangs in the same place, if I modify it -- it starts to\nhang in a different place -- so I guess it depends not on timing, but on memory\nallocation somehow.\n\nAny ideas?
