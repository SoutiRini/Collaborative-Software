The filenames of the generated documents are \ngenerated, too, and for some types of PDFs they become very long. Obviously \nthere some AR versions which cannot handle printing of a document which such a \nlong filename. At that point it also makes sense that printing after saving \nworks. The user probably would have chosen a much shorter filename.\n\nThank you,\nStephan", "attachment_id": null, "id": 68227, "creator": "stephan.naecker@dresdner-bank.com", "time": "2004-12-10T08:34:27Z", "bug_id": 32600, "creation_time": "2004-12-10T08:34:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 32600, "attachment_id": null, "id": 156642, "time": "2012-04-01T13:50:49Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:50:49Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs"}]
