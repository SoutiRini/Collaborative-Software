[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I've only tested this on tomcat8 with IE, but the logic looks the same (at least in the ApplicationPart class) so it may affect other versions. Steps to reproduce are:\n\n* Startup tomcat with a user/role setup for manager-gui\n* Log in and attempt to deploy a WAR from the Manager application\n\n1) Click \"Browse...\" button and select a war file in field WAR file to deploy => File is selected via \"input\" element with type \"file\"\n\n    C:\\temp\\test.war\n\n2. Click deploy\n3. Status of operation is OK\n4. Displayed context of the application is shown:\n\n    /C:temptest\n\n5. Application fails to start\n\nAdditional information:\n\nI've traced the problem down to org.apache.catalina.manager.HTMLManagerServlet:242; warPart.getSubmittedFileName() strips the '\\' characters from the filename and therefore makes it incorrect before the context creation occurs. The logic for that method is encapsulated in the org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationPart.getSubmittedFileName() method (line 152 where the call to HttpParser.unquote() returns the bad result). I would submit a patch for it, but I'm not exactly sure in what cases the \\s should be stripped as the logic only works correctly at the moment with linux (I assume).", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 60371, "id": 194985, "time": "2016-11-14T20:02:09Z", "creator": "csutherl@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-11-14T20:02:09Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "text": "This might be related to 59115 and the issue in IE?", "id": 194987, "time": "2016-11-14T20:17:24Z", "bug_id": 60371, "creation_time": "2016-11-14T20:17:24Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Yep, this is IE not following the specs.
