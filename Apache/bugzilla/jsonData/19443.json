When the \nserver is built with modules that use the __floatdisf symbol it can't be \nstarted. e.g.:\n\n  Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/libproxy.so into server:\n  ld.so.1: ../bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file\n  /usr/local/apache/libexec/libproxy.so: symbol __floatdisf: referenced\n  symbol not found\n\nThe missing symbol is in libgcc.a. Use\n\n  % gcc -print-libgcc-file-name\n\nto see where that file is. Once found you have to relink the module with that \nfile. You can also look for it in the gcc tree, e.g. under gcc-3.2.1/gcc.\n\nFirst, configure and install Apache. Next, relink mod_proxy.so or \nmod_negotiation.so, or whatever the module that reports the problem with libgcc.\na.\n\n  % cd apache_1.3.27/src/modules\n  % ld -G -o mod_proxy.so mod_proxy.lo /pathto/libgcc.a\n\n(adjust the /pathto/ to point to the right file from the gcc output stage.)\n\nYou can now verify with nm that mod_proxy.so includes that symbol.\n\n====\n\nFollowing these instructions I was able to get past my problem with mod_status.  \nI'm unclear if this is a problem with the Makefile or did I configure it wrong \nwhen I built it.\n\nHere are the particulars for my environment:\n\n# uname -a\nSunOS sarlacc 5.8 Generic_108528-19 sun4u sparc\n\n# gcc -v\nReading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/2.95.3/specs\ngcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)\n\n./configure --prefix=/home/krasmuss/projects/apache2/www/apache \n--enable-mods-shared=all --disable-auth-digest --with-mpm=worker\n\nRegards,\nKirk Rasmussen"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19443, "text": "My impression is that this is a problem with an improperly installed\ngcc.
