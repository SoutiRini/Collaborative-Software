If the header had already\nbeen set, the new value overwrites the previous one. The containsHeader method\ncan be used to test for the presence of a header before setting its value.\n----spec SRV5.2 headers--------\nThe setHeader method sets a header with a given name and value. A previous\nheader is replaced by the new header. Where a set of header values exist for the\nname, the values are cleared and replaced with the new value.\n\n----------------\nSubjectively speaking, there is no unsetHeader() and you can imagine that the\nJSR wouldn't have forgotten about that. The .reset() is the only way to clear\nheaders. The behavior of setHeader(name, null) on a non-existing header is to\nactually add an entry in the headers with a null value. This indicates the\ntomcat code can at least support null values. Therefore, replacement of an\nexisting value with null is supported.\n\nOtherwise, it remains impossible to clear just one: since you cannot find\nexisting headers names nor values, you cannot back them up prior to reset and\ncannot repopulate the existing headers you want to keep (ex: from a servlet\nfilter in orthogonal code). So, the api subjectively indicates that clearing a\nheader is done through setHeader(null) although not declaratively spec'ed out.\nin the jsr.
