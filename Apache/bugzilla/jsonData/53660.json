You can't expect RTF to behave in the same way as a PDF and it would be wrong for us to do this just so it can fall in line with another format. Although the specification is somewhat vague on the matter, there is no encompassing table object to ensure it conforms neatly to a rectangle shape. Instead, you define a series of \\trowd with contained \\cell items which share a positioning control (to align cells to appear uniform in columns). As such, it is up to the person defining the table to ensure how the table is written.\n\nThe simple fix here is to add the correct number of cells to each row.
