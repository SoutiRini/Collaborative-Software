I'm thinking of a\ncentralized asset store. The assets in that store could be referenced\nwithin xml docs by appropiate tags.\n\nImagine a document using markup like this:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n\n<html\n\txmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" \n\txmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" \n\txmlns:lenya=\"http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/page-envelope/1.0\"\n \txmlns:asset=\"http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/asset/1.0\"\n>\n    \n<body>\n\t<p>Hello, the <asset:ref-link id=\"w3\"/> is leading the Web to its full\npotential.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nThe <asset:ref-link> tag will be transformed to a normal <a> tag by a\nxsl file called asset2xhtml which is triggered by\npublication-sitemap.xconf. From this point on, link management could be\nquite easy maintained by a asset manager.....\n\nAttached you will find an example asset store and a modified\npublication-sitemap.xmap.\n\n\nIt would be interesting for me, what you think about an asset store like\npointed out above.\n\nNOTE: The attached files and the code in here is less then draft!\n", "attachment_id": null, "id": 71448, "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "time": "2005-02-24T01:38:26Z", "bug_id": 24600, "creation_time": "2005-02-24T01:38:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 14354\nProposed format for central asset store", "attachment_id": 14354, "id": 71449, "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "time": "2005-02-24T01:40:19Z", "bug_id": 24600, "creation_time": "2005-02-24T01:40:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "text": "This is obsolete since we have UUIDs and the \"resource\" resource type.", "is_private": false, "id": 102087, "creator": "andreas@apache.org", "time": "2007-04-23T05:05:09Z", "bug_id": 24600, "creation_time": "2007-04-23T05:05:09Z", "attachment_id": null}]
