If\nI use <Context path=\"\" ...>, my app appears to load fine, but then Tomcat seems\nto attempt to load it a second time, and I get the following error:\n\nWARN [main] JDBCExceptionReporter.logExceptions(35) | SQL Error: 0, SQLState: null\nERROR [main] JDBCExceptionReporter.logExceptions(42) | Cannot load JDBC driver\nclass 'null'\nWARN [main] SessionFactoryImpl.<init>(163) | Could not obtain connection metadata\njava.sql.SQLException: Cannot load JDBC driver class 'null'\n\nFrom this, I assumed that Tomcat was trying to load my app both at the root\ncontext path (\"\") and a context path that's the same as the directory (\"/cct\").\n So I created a second xml file in webapps, and named it cct2.xml and changed\nthe path to \"/cct\".  I don't get the error above, but the app does indeed load\ntwice.  I was hoping I could turn off this load-the-second-one behavior by\nchanging unpackWARs and/or autoDeploy to false on my <Host> element, but no such\nluck.  Is there a way to fix this?\n\nI can successfully use the app at http://localhost/, but I'd rather not see\nthese errors, and I'd rather not see it load twice.  \n\nI'm using Tomcat 4.1.18, JDK 1.4.1_01 on Win2K and RedHat 8.0.\n\nOne workaround I found was to change the name of my app's directory to ROOT and\nuse that as the path for my context.  \n\nIs this expected/anticipated behavior?", "id": 30664, "time": "2003-02-04T16:07:53Z", "creator": "mraible@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-02-04T16:07:53Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "medthomas@ntlworld.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 50022, "time": "2004-01-04T20:03:52Z", "bug_id": 16762, "creation_time": "2004-01-04T20:03:52Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 23267 ***"}]
