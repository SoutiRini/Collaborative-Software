Cache-control: no-cache=\"set-cookie, set-cookie2\"\n\t3.C. Location (new location, i.e. /login2)\n\t\nHaving the JMeter call \"/login\" and with follow redirect or redirect automatically will simply send JMeter into infinite loop. WSP insist that the call after the 302 to NOT have the cookie X1 as the header was also instructing the calling NOT to store such cookie with  (Cache-control: no-cache=\"set-cookie, set-cookie2\"). All Browsers do respect that and call the new page location \"/login2\" WITHOUT the \"X1\" cookie.  \n\nThis gave us very very hard time and simply made it almost impossible to use JMeter with WSP. \n\nThis also opened the our eyes for 2 other limitations in JMeter. \n\n1. PostProcess, only apply to the last call in \"follow redirect\" chained sampler, if this can be run in every call, we could have simply cleared the bad cookie ourselves.\n\n2. We even went as far as creating our own follow redirect loop. But the problem we couldn't find a way to group or ignore the 302 calls (i.e. in the tree view)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "Not sure I understand what is the purpose of sending a cookie that is not allowed to be stored.
