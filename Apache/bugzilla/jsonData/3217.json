When installing IBM VisualAge for Java Enterprise, this entry is \nadded to the classpath: C:\\IBM Connectors\\classes.  The problem here in lies \nwith the fact that VAJ adds it without \" \" around the entry which contains \nblank spaces.  When running the ant.bat I kept getting a NoClassDefinitionFound \nexception.  It took me a half an hour to notice the blank space in the system \nclasspath and subsequently put the requisite \" \" around the entry.  This fixed \nthe problem and the ant test ran fine.  \n\nThis maybe something you might want to add to the documentation just help \ndevelopers avoid confusion and the mandatory banging of the head against the \nproverbeal wall.\n\nRegards,\nScott T.
