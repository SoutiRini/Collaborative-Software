I think the problem is in the class \nLineArea. The instance works for hyphenation correctly only after it renders a text which \nhits the right border of an area. After that all member variables have now right values for \nhyphenation.\n\nexample:\n\nI have two <fo:block>-tags, which contains the same text und attributes. The first <\nfo:block> is wrapped for the first time at all at the end of line. So the last word of the line is \nhyphenated. The same thing happens (of course) to the second block. The result isn't the \nsame.\n\n\t<fo:block font-size=\"7pt\"\n\t\t\t  font-family=\"arial\"\n\t\t\t  font-weight=\"normal\"\n\t\t\t  text-align=\"left\"\n\t\t\t  space-after=\"1.5mm\"\n\t\t\t  color=\"#000000\">\n\t\t\t  bla bla T-D1-Company bla bla\n\t</fo:block>\n\t<fo:block font-size=\"7pt\"\n\t\t\t  font-family=\"arial\"\n\t\t\t  font-weight=\"normal\"\n\t\t\t  text-align=\"left\"\n\t\t\t  space-after=\"1.5mm\"\n\t\t\t  color=\"#000000\">\n\t\t\t  bla bla T-D1-Company bla bla\n\t</fo:block>\n\nresult:\nbla bla om-\nT-D1-Cpany bla bla \n\nbla bla T-D1-\nCompany bla bla \n\nAs you can see the string \"T-D1-Company\" is hyphenated to \"om-T-D1-Cpany\" which is \nwrong. But the second hyphenation of the same string is right. \n\nIf you now change the content of the first block, so there is no hyphenation needed, then \nit works fine. The hyphenation of the second block is right. This is my work around for that \nfeature...:-)\n\nI know I should send the complete fo-document...I try to find a \"small\" example to show it. \nI hope you can understand my bug report...:-)\n\n-Michael"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14478, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 27214, "time": "2002-12-01T15:50:17Z", "creator": "j3322ptm@yahoo.de", "creation_time": "2002-12-01T15:50:17Z", "text": "Fixed in CVS maintenance branch"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 156138, "time": "2012-04-01T07:00:41Z", "bug_id": 14478, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:00:41Z", "is_private": false}]
