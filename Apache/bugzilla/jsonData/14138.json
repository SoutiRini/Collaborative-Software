[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "1) Application/User properties - This controls the placement of the \napplication frame on the desktop, \nthe splitpane divider locations, open projects, last visited directory when \nopening or saving, text \nfonts and colors for console pane and source viewer, etc...\n\n2) Preference Manager - Allows the creation of editors for preferences for \neach module if desired.\n\n3) New property editor - The new property editor is created by Introspecting \nthe selected task creating\nappropriate field for the getter/setter bean property.  Since Ant tends to not \nhave getters a middle\npiece was created to port the setters to properties thus giving read/write \ncapability to an otherwise\nwrite only property.\n\n4) New visual look for the editors - Follows a lot like the eclipse editor for \ntheir xml pieces (I don't\nknow how better to explain it, it's a must see addition).\n\n5) Property Helper - Much like a code completion piece in an IDE except this \nonly helps with the property\nselection.  If a user types a $ and then nothing for predetermined time up \npops a property chooser with \na list of already defined properties.\n\n6) Source Viewer - Shows the document that is being created.  No editing \ncapability.  Color coding\n(preference editor does not currently work).\n\n7) Cut/Paste/Copy - Functionality allows the user to Cut/Paste or Copy/Paste \nany tree node \n(Type/Task/Property/Target) in the navigator and across projects.\n\n8) Help - This is the JavaHelp system, but currently is not functioning.  \nPlans to change to a web browser\nlauncher if we move to a Java WebStart deployment plan.  The only way to keep \nthe JavaHelp system is to\nJar all the documentation that is produced for Ant.\n\n9) Wizard - The wizard is now accessible from a menu within the running \napplication.
