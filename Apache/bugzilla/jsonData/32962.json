[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\nI know - MPM perchild is unstable.\n\nBut there is a big problem. As you can read on the page (in header), it's really\nunsecure to provide webhosting with PHP support. The only way, how to make it\nsecure is to use Perchild and run each VirtualHost under it's own UID.\n\nI know - it has several performance implications, but I consider this approach\nto be the only way out. It's better than runing several hunderts instances of Apache\n\nAnd I know - PHP is not stable with multitherading MPMs - but this is another\nchapter.\n\nSomebody should make Perchild stable. If not - every webhoster in the world will\nrun into big troubles ...\n\nI'm ready to calaborate. Just write me, what can I do...\n\nRegards\n    Tony", "is_private": false, "id": 69265, "creator": "karasek@ceskyserver.cz", "time": "2005-01-06T13:04:46Z", "bug_id": 32962, "creation_time": "2005-01-06T13:04:46Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "is_private": false, "text": "The only thing that can be done is that someone can take on perchild maintenance\nand start testing it and submitting patches to fix it.
