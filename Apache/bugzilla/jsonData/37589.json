But someone has to have the time and motivation to\nactually do it. You've got access to the source code. Patches are welcome!!! :-)\n\nBTW, FOP Trunk/0.90alpha1 supports setting all the above through the\nFOUserAgent. Granted, it's not the same as setting these values through the FO\ninput and we don't support XMP metadata, yet. But everyone is invited to help\nimprove.", "id": 82728, "time": "2005-11-22T11:08:34Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-11-22T11:08:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37589, "attachment_id": null, "id": 82735, "time": "2005-11-22T20:04:27Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-11-22T20:04:27Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I've added your tip to the website sources.
