I.e, I see all the drop shadow, even though\nthe document is supposedly exactly the same.\n\nAny ideas??\n\nThanks,\n-Archie\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\nArchie Cobbs      *        CTO, Awarix        *      http://www.awarix.com"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37276, "attachment_id": 16820, "id": 81843, "time": "2005-10-27T18:55:21Z", "creator": "archie@dellroad.org", "creation_time": "2005-10-27T18:55:21Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 16820\nTest program that demonstrates the bug\n\nRun this test a few times.
