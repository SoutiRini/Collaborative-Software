As I am in the situation of having to keep all classes under /WEB-INF/classes/, I wrote a patch to add this capability for Tomcat. So with this patch it is possible to sign a .war file and to have the classes contained in the .war files signed and run correctly withing a Tomcat with enabled security manager.\n\nCurrently only packed war files are supported (so uncompress in server.xml must be false). Perhaps there is an easier way of getting the file name of the original war file, enabling a support also for uncompressed .war files.\n\nAttached is the patch file in diff -u format.", "id": 152925, "time": "2012-01-19T13:43:10Z", "creator": "tomcatmailing@ttsecure.org", "creation_time": "2012-01-19T13:43:10Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
