Neither can I see how any of the changes yet to be made to 6.0.x would impact this.\n\nAlthough this issue is raised against TC6 on Windows, it appears you are using a 3rd party packaged Tomcat 5.5.20 on linux. I can't recall any difference between TC6 and TC5 that would account for this either.\n\nIt is hard to see how this happens. I suspect a configuration issue. Please use the users list to debug further.\n\nAs a first step you might want to test using an ASF Tomcat distribution as some 3rd party distributions have exhibited odd behaviour in the past."}]
