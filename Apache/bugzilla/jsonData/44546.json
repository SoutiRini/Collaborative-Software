I'm using Jasper via the maven2 jspc plugin and so have no idea what version it is. I'm guessing it's Tomcat 5. I'm also guessing it's a problem with Jasper and not the plugin.\n\nNow onto the bug...\n\nWhen I don't use jspc the application works perfectly. \n\n2008-03-06 10:43:52,622 ERROR [org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[jboss.web].[localhost].[/WhenShouldITakeMyMeds].[jsp.WEB_002dINF.jsp.createSchedule_js\np]] Servlet.service() for servlet jsp.WEB_002dINF.jsp.createSchedule_jsp threw exception\njavax.servlet.jsp.JspTagException: No message found under code '' for locale 'en_US'.\n        at org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.MessageTag.doStartTagInternal(MessageTag.java:184)\n        at org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.RequestContextAwareTag.doStartTag(RequestContextAwareTag.java:77)\n        at org.apache.jsp.tag.web.formRow_tag._jspx_meth_spring_message_0(org.apache.jsp.tag.web.formRow_tag:224)\n        at org.apache.jsp.tag.web.formRow_tag.doTag(org.apache.jsp.tag.web.formRow_tag:141)\n        at jsp.WEB_002dINF.jsp.createSchedule_jsp._jspx_meth_tags_formRow_0(jsp.WEB_002dINF.jsp.createSchedule_jsp:199)\n\n\nThe line causing the problems is in a tag file called standardHead.tag which sets the title, meta information, imports css etc.\n\n<%@ include file=\"/WEB-INF/includes/useTags.jsp\" %>\n\n<%@ attribute name=\"code\" required=\"true\" %>\n\n<head>\n\t<title><spring:message code=\"site.title\"/> - <spring:message code=\"${code}\"/></title>\n\t<jsp:doBody />\t\n</head>\n\nOther message codes throughout the site work fine, but when they are passed as attributes to a tag file, they don't.\n\nOther infomation that may be of interest - I'm compiling with java 6, but targetting java 5, and running ubuntu 7.10.

If you can tell me how to precompile the JSPs just using jasper, I'll happily do that to isolate the issue from maven2"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44546, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 114379, "time": "2008-03-06T13:21:49Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-03-06T13:21:49Z", "text": "http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/jasper-howto.html#Web%20Application%20Compilation\n\nI am sssuming this is a configuration issue for now.
