So, when we try to do some other operation we get an error : \"Cannot change transaction isolation level in the middle of a transaction\"\nThus, we have to forcefully commit the validation query, by making defaultAutoCommit=true in our datasource configuration.\nAny insight on this is much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nDenuwanthi.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 177790, "creation_time": "2014-09-12T09:01:24Z", "time": "2014-09-12T09:01:24Z", "creator": "denuwanthi.hasanthika@gmail.com", "bug_id": 56974, "is_private": false}]
