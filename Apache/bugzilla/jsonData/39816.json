[{"text": "On AIX, using IBM's RPM packaging of libtool (libtool-1.5.8-1), a\n'./buildconf.sh' in the Apache top directory causes an error when APR's\n'buildconf' is being run, because it cannot find the libtool helper libtool.m4.\n\nThe reason is (from srclib/apr/buildconf):\n\n  libtoolize=`build/PrintPath glibtoolize libtoolize`\n\n...which, using the IBM RPM, yields:\n\n  /usr/bin/libtoolize\n\nLater on, the path is extracted:\n\n  ltpath=`dirname $libtoolize`\n  ltfile=${LIBTOOL_M4-`cd $ltpath/../share/aclocal ; pwd`/libtool.m4}\n\n...yielding /usr/bin as the path, and resulting in an attempt to enter the\ndirectory /usr/bin/../share/aclocal, i.e. /usr/share/aclocal, which does not\nexist on the system.\n\n\nThe underlying problem is that the RPM has created a symbolic link\n/usr/bin/libtoolize -> ../../opt/freeware/bin/libtoolize, and the system's PATH\nhas /usr/bin as its first component, so 'libtoolize' is \"found\" there, and hence\nAPR assumes that /usr/share/aclocal should exist (and assumes that libtool.m4 is\nto be found there).\n\nThe actual location of the libtool.m4 file is\n/opt/freeware/share/aclocal/libtool.m4.\n\n\nShould I blame IBM for not also symlinking /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 ->\n/opt/freeware/share/aclocal/libtool.m4, or would it be possible to perform some\nfurther detection in APR's 'buildconf', or can I somehow set LIBTOOL_M4 when\nperforming './buildconf.sh' without that setting getting lost somewhere on the way?\n\nYour thoughts on this issue would be much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nBest regards,\nBj\u00f6rn", "tags": [], "creator": "Bjorn.Wiberg@uadm.uu.se", "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 90236, "time": "2006-06-15T08:44:54Z", "bug_id": 39816, "creation_time": "2006-06-15T08:44:54Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "1) You shouldn't need to run buildconf to build Apache 2.0.58 on AIX.\nThus, the libtool on the system shouldn't be important.\n2) If you do need to run buildconf for some reason, and you're having\nlibtool-related issues, install the GNU tools from source and see if you\nencounter a problem.
