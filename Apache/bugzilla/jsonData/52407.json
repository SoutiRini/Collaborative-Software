Proposal: \"default\" attribute for this tag. \n\nReal life case: on my project we use Ant for platform-independent ability of calling some command like utilities, and need to provide some parameter via -D{name}={value}. In some cases the values are pretty static so it would be nice to omit them in a command line. The problem is that we must handle such 'omitted' params on a level of java code of our utilities. And it would be great if the definition of the task looked like:\n\n<target name=\"mycall\">\n  <java ...>\n    <arg value=\"${url}\" default=\"http://mmm.com\"/>\n  </java>\n</target>\n\nIf appropriate parameter is not specified by a user in a command line, Ant script would handle this and substitute a proper value. Benefit: no need to handle default values on the level of java code. \n\nRegards, \nIvan", "id": 152503, "time": "2012-01-01T11:15:05Z", "bug_id": 52407, "creation_time": "2012-01-01T11:15:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "There already is a way to provide default values for properties, the property task.\n\nWhat you are trying to do is\n\n<target name=\"mycall\">\n  <property name=\"url\" value=\"http://mmm.com\"/>\n  <java ...>\n    <arg value=\"${url}\"/>\n  </java>\n</target>\n\nwhere the property task won't do anything if the url property has already been set via the command line.\n\nAnother option would be the props Antlib with something like\n\n  <java ...>\n    <arg value=\"${url:=http://mmm.com}\"/>\n  </java>\n\nbut since it hasn't been released yet, I'm reluctant to recommending it.", "id": 152723, "time": "2012-01-12T15:47:01Z", "bug_id": 52407, "creation_time": "2012-01-12T15:47:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
