However, when the comparison operator is something like \"not equals\" then the result should be TRUE even when the one value is a Number and the other is a String.  Currently it is FALSE in this case, which doesn't match Excel's behavior, and is logically incorrect (I'm not willing to say those two are always equivalent).\n\nAlso affects 4.0-dev, which is where I'll address it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61761, "attachment_id": null, "id": 202139, "time": "2017-11-15T08:41:16Z", "creator": "gwoolsey@apache.org", "creation_time": "2017-11-15T08:41:16Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Fixed in r1815298"}]
