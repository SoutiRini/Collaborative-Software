Although \nmembers of the British insurance industry might expect strings of the form NN \nto be permissible as gDay values, there's no guarantee that all other users \nwould have a similar expectation; a program that was written with the \nexpectation that any value validated against gDay has the form ---NN would \nbehave incorrectly if it suddenly had to deal with values of the form NN as \nwell.\n\nA solution for that industry's purposes might be to define a type that is a \nunion of gDay and a type that is a suitable restriction of the string type or \npositiveInteger type.\n\nOtherwise, you really ought to raise this is a requirement to the XML Schema \nWorking Group."}]
