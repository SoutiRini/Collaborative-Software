It is in the file \"ContentImpl.java\", in the \npackage \"org.apache.slide.content\". Here is the code snippet of it(around line \n460):\n\n// set the display name (in case of copy)\nif (!Configuration.useBinding(namespace.getUri(token, strUri).getStore())) {\n if(revisionDescriptor.getName() == null || revisionDescriptor.getName().length\n() == 0){\n           revisionDescriptor.setName(new UriPath(strUri).lastSegment());\n        }\n}\nThen I commented the If-Condition \"if(revisionDescriptor.getName().....)\", \nwithout changing the body of that condition.
