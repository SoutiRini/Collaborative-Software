I also note\nthat the current version of WinVNC4, which is also open sourced, has appropriate\ncode to handle these behaviors under this platform.  That code might be a good\nstarting point if work is ever to be finished incorporating Apache properly into\nthe 9x OS.  I know it would be invaluable to me to be able to terminate the\nprocess gracefully on shutdown as easily as VNC does.  Please consider taking a\nlook at this compatibility issue for a future version.
