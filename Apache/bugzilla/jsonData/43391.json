[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43391, "text": "According to the JVM Instruction Set, ARRAYLENGTH pops a value from the stack\nand pushes a value to the stack. In BCEL, it only implements StackProducer, so\nit creates an incorrectly high stack height. The Constants class already has the\ncorrect value for it, but since the instruction does not implement StackConsumer\nit is never used. The easiest solution is to change\nsrc\\java\\src\\java\\org\\apache\\bcel\\generic\\ARRAYLENGTH.java to implement\nStackConsumer. This will fix the bug.\n\nI didn't attach a patch for this because the change is so tiny.", "id": 108179, "time": "2007-09-13T16:03:06Z", "creator": "zappacky@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-09-13T16:03:06Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43391, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks!
