[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nI have migrated my current Web Application from Tomcat 6.0.26 to Tomcat 7.0.8\n\nIn Tomcat 7 there was a problem finding my custom written Tag Libraries.\nE.g. I have one tag library descriptor in /WEB-INF/tags/filter.tld\nIn the jsp file I try to get this tag library with uri=/filter\n\nIn Tomcat 6 everything works fine, in 7 I get JasperException saying he did\nnot find the file. (FileNotFoundException)\n\nDuring debug I found out that the TldLocationsCache#tldScanResourcePaths\nignores all files in /WEB-INF/tags. Have a look around line 310 there is\nfollowing condition:\n\nif (path.startsWith(\"/WEB-INF/tags/\") && !path.endsWith(\"implicit.tld\")) {\n     continue;\n}\n\nAt this point he ignores my tag library cause it does not (and should not) end\nwith \"implicit.tld\".\nFrom my point of view the negotiation sign \"!\" is wrong. It should ignore all\nimplicit.tld like it is described in oracle\u00b4s jsp reference, instead he ignores\nall others. I recompiled it without that sign and everything is working out of the box!\n\nI am a bit wondering that no one else found out this mistake, cause no \ntag library should work in this way. Or I am doing something very wrong\nat this stage?\n\nThanks in advance,\nandre", "attachment_id": null, "id": 144306, "creator": "andreslu@gmx.net", "time": "2011-02-15T09:47:04Z", "bug_id": 50783, "creation_time": "2011-02-15T09:47:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "As per section JSP.8.4.3 of the JSP 2.2 specification.", "id": 144323, "time": "2011-02-15T12:19:40Z", "bug_id": 50783, "creation_time": "2011-02-15T12:19:40Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
