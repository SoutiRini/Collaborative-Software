Specifically \nit will not run on my Solaris 8 01/00. This is because libsendfile.so.1 library \nwas not introduced in the SUNWcsl package until 10/01. If you try to start \nhttpd on a 01/00 version of Solaris 8 you get a library not found message.\n\n# more /etc/release\n                           Solaris 8 s28_38shwp2 SPARC\n           Copyright 2000 Sun Microsystems, Inc.
