This was due to the line endings in the source archive I downloaded.  After speaking with the community (Mark, Felix, Violeta, others) I discovered that I should be using the src tar gz, instead of the zip file, to build on MAC.\n\nThe root of this problem is line endings not clearly defined in the documentation.  This is a place to put a patch for the documentation that will clearly indicate what will define line endings in the build process."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "andrewlanecarr@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 194836, "time": "2016-11-05T17:21:34Z", "bug_id": 60344, "creation_time": "2016-11-05T17:21:34Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Also, Mark suggested we clearly define this in the documentation, see snippet below:\n\n>>> ...it would be great if you could turn them into a patch \n>>> for the website - probably this page (part of the main wbesite):\n>>> http://tomcat.apache.org/svn.html\n>>> and/or this file (part of the docs):\n>>> http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/building.html"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Site fixed as well as\n- trunk for 9.0.0.M16 onwards\n- 8.5.x for 8.5.10 onwards\n- 8.0.x for 8.0.40 onwards\n- 7.0.x for 7.0.74 onwards\n\nMark", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 60344, "id": 195826, "time": "2017-01-03T17:50:06Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2017-01-03T17:50:06Z", "is_private": false}]
