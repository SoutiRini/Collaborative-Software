It was not that important and actually I wrote the XMLSocketHubReceiver to connect my LOG4RPG to Chainsaw to ease my life.\n\nHonestly I obviously never tested the XMLSocketHubReceiver with a Java client, because I had to write a XMLSocketAppender to do that now. All I did so far was to connect Chainsaw with my RPG applications running on an IBM i5 (= AS/400).\n\nIf you like, I can send two Eclipse projects to you to test the receiver. The first project configures and starts Chainsaw, so you do not really need it. The second project is the XMLSocketHubReceiver along with the brand new XMLSocketAppender (just a clone of the SocketAppender) and a test driver. The test driver is pretty simple. It configures a XMLSocketAppender and sends 60 log events to Chainsaw.\n\nBoth projects are around 5MB.\n\nThomas.", "id": 167280, "time": "2013-05-18T21:59:57Z", "bug_id": 41006, "creation_time": "2013-05-18T21:59:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41006, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 167283, "time": "2013-05-19T09:08:38Z", "creator": "grobmeier@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-05-19T09:08:38Z", "text": "Very cool folks.
