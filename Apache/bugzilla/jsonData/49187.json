I have attached the information that the user has provided below. If you have any questions please let me know.\n\n===================\n\n\nBinary package hint: apache2\n\nOn a lucid server we see apache segmentation faulting at a high rate. This causes svn checkouts to fail depending on the client (e.g. on Ubunut 9.10 subversion with neon as dav lib is okay, serf is not). I was able to reproduce it with a minimal setup:\n\nUsing lucid from today, i.e. with\n\nwith mods-enabled:\nalias auth_basic authz_default authz_host cache dav dav_svn deflate info mem_cache mime\n\ndav_svn.conf:\n<Location /svn>\n  DAV svn\n  SVNParentPath /var/lib/svn\n  SVNListParentPath on\n  SVNPathAuthz off\n</Location>\n\nmem_cache.conf is untouched. I created an svn repo /var/lib/svn/svn_memcache (see attachment). With some clients I cannot check it out, it fails for bad.root segfaulting apache. wget http://localhost/svn/svn_memcache/bad.root never succeeds.\n\nIf I disable mem_cache it works. (Yes, I know that we shouldn't have it enabled for serving svn to begin with and I am thankful for mem_cache pointing this out but that's not the point here :-)\n\nCheers, Axel.\n\n================\n\n\n\nSure, here it is.\n\n#0 0x00007ffff5cc613e in ??
