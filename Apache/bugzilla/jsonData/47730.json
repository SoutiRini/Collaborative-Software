I'm unsure which of the remaining build events would also return a null Properties object.\n\nA documentation  alternative would be to write this information once in the Project.getProperties() javadoc, then add @see javadoc comments for this method in all the javadoc for the build events, buildStarted included."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47730, "attachment_id": null, "id": 129911, "time": "2009-08-25T00:40:02Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-08-25T00:40:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "svn revision 807505"}]
