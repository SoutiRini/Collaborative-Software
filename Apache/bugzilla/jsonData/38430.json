We have allocated 2GB\nof swap space for the processes running in the server, But the tomcat server is\nclaiming most of the memory in RAM and the swap space. When we start an instance\nof the server, it spwans 63 java processes and on issuing the  shutdown request,\n11 processes still remains in memory.\n\nOnce the swap space is completely eaten up, the server will automatically\nshutdown and we need to restart it. This is happening every 2-3 hrs and as this\nis our production server we are having troubles answering queries of our clients.\n\nWe would like to fix this problem ASAP and get the server to run properly.\nKindly help us by giving your valuable suggestions in this regard.\n\nThanks and Regards\nJugs"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38430, "attachment_id": null, "id": 85160, "time": "2006-01-28T16:36:57Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-01-28T16:36:57Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.\n\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/findhelp.html will direct you to a more appropriate\nforum for your question."}]
