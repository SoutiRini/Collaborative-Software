This class, however, is\ndeclared as final in both tested Xalan versions and XPathUtil thus fails to\nload. This renders all xml jstl tags unusable.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Add any xml jstl tag with a select attribute to a jsp page.\n2) Try to view the page. A ServletException as the result of a ValidationError\nwill occur.
