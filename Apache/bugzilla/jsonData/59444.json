That way it is impossible to define Content Type, Expire, Cache Control and other Headers by means of configuration parameters. However, it is still possible to output headers by the php script directly, but this is not always an acceptable solution.\n\nInstead, any Cache-Control, Expire or other headers that were defined to fit a special Mimetype, VirtualHost, Path, File or Location should remain an and be sent out even if the request is redirected and its response generated through mod_fcgid as action handler."}]
