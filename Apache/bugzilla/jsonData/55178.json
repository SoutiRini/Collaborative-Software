They are accompanied by documentation (though I've sadly not been able to extend French language version documentation for the modules):\n\n* mod_authn_ldap: Allow authentication with SASL\n\nThe first patch adds a directive to specify the SASL mechanism. This alone is not enough for much practical use (apart from anonymous binds, or credentials supplied via other means, such as pre-initialized Kerberos credentials cache), but lays foundation for sane extending. It would be easy to e.g. add PLAIN authentication without hardcoding it, as is done in bug #51757.\n\n* mod_authn_ldap: Allow specifying SASL interaction\n\nThis allows for running a command when SASL interaction is required to obtain credentials. The actual conversation is very mechanism dependent (bug #51757 is a good example how could it be extended for PLAIN mechanism), this just delegates the work to a command. An example in documentation shows how to use this to obtain Kerberos TGT to initialize credentials cache for GSSAPI mechanism to succeed."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 30517\nmod_authn_ldap: Allow specifying SASL interaction", "attachment_id": 30517, "id": 168202, "creator": "lkundrak@v3.sk", "time": "2013-07-01T20:26:12Z", "bug_id": 55178, "creation_time": "2013-07-01T20:26:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55178, "text": "http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/201307.mbox/%3C201307140941.04198.sf@sfritsch.de%3E", "id": 174131, "time": "2014-03-27T14:53:03Z", "creator": "lkundrak@v3.sk", "creation_time": "2014-03-27T14:53:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
