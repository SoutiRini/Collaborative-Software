Then I found the \nWin32DisableAcceptEx directive, which solved the problem.\n\nI've read the documentation for the directive, so I know the bug itself might be \nrelated to something external to Apache (although exiting virus scanners, \nfirewalls etc on my computer didn't help). How widepread is this problem? If the \nbug itself is completely out of Apache's control, I suggest some enhancements \nwhich might help others encountering the same problem:\n\n- Sniff the behaviour of AcceptEx() upon starting Apache (if this is feasible), \nand log any potential problems found. (I did not encounter the error condition \nmentioned in the Win32DisableAcceptEx directive documentation - NO indication of \na problem was given to me.) \n- Add the directive to the Windows-distributed httpd.conf in the WinNT MPM \nsection (commented out by default, I would guess), making it clear to the user \nthat there might be a potential problem lurking."}, {"text": "patches welcome, going to close out this dup user config report", "tags": [], "bug_id": 37177, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 112032, "time": "2007-12-21T21:10:31Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-12-21T21:10:31Z", "attachment_id": null}]
