The end flow doesn't fit in the \"last\" SPM, so it flow in a \"rest\" SPM\nand then append an empty \"last\" SPM. This is correct, the last page is a \"last\"\nSPM layout.\nThis gives 3 pages: FIRST, REST, LAST\n\n2) The second page-sequence is identical to the first, apart from the\nforce-page-count=\"even\" attribute. In this case. We get 4 pages as expected by\nthe force-page-count to even.\nBut we get FIRST, REST, LAST, REST, instead of FIRST, REST, REST, LAST.\n\nGuillaume.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42779, "id": 104905, "time": "2007-06-29T07:12:36Z", "creator": "guillaume.levrero@free.fr", "creation_time": "2007-06-29T07:12:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 20421\nFO to repoduce BUG.", "bug_id": 42779, "attachment_id": 20421, "id": 104906, "time": "2007-06-29T07:13:14Z", "creator": "guillaume.levrero@free.fr", "creation_time": "2007-06-29T07:13:14Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42779, "attachment_id": null, "text": "*** Bug 42852 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 105273, "time": "2007-07-11T01:01:32Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-11T01:01:32Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42779, "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to comment #2)\n> *** Bug 42852 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***\n\nHowever, see also that bug for another sample fo file.", "id": 105274, "time": "2007-07-11T01:03:11Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-11T01:03:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "change status from ASSIGNED to NEW for consistency", "id": 157919, "time": "2012-04-11T06:18:00Z", "bug_id": 42779, "creation_time": "2012-04-11T06:18:00Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42779, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 51962 ***", "id": 160776, "time": "2012-07-21T20:04:35Z", "creator": "matthias8283@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2012-07-21T20:04:35Z", "is_private": false}]
