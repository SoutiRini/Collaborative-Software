As soons \nas the client click on the 'stop' button or whatever that closes the socket \nbetween browser and server, one httpd process enters an infinite loop  with one \nAjp13Connectector thread. Trussing the looping apache process, it looks like \nthis :\n\n6766/1:         send(7, \"12 4\\0\\0\", 4, 0)                       = 4\n6766/1:         recv(7, \" A B\\003\", 4, 0)                       = 4\n6766/1:         recv(7, \"061FFA\", 3, 0)                         = 3\n\nreading AJP protocol : Send me more data, sorry I've none left.\nMy quick and dirty hack was to pass my forms into GET method, and kill the \nlooping httpd processes (it turned my production servers back into a stable \nbehaviour, hopefully !).. I don't have any patch to submit, sorry.\n\nHope this helps"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8613, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This was fixed a long time ago.
