[{"text": "Commit notes:\n (1) More refactoring of the code.\nSummary of Changes\n - SlideShow, Sheet and Shape should be navigatable in both directions, i.e.\ngiven a shape it should be possible to get the owning sheet and given a sheet \nget the owning SlideShow:\n\nShape shape = ....;\nSheet sheet = shape.getSheet();\nSlideShow ppt = sheet.getSlideShow();\n\nI added the required members and accessors to Sheet and Shape. Also had to make\nSlideShow.getDocumentRecord public \nsince we need to access it outside of usermodel package.\n\n\n- Added default constructors to create new TextBytesAtom, StyleTextPropAtom,\nEscherTextboxWrapper and TextHeaderAtom\n\n- added PPDrawing.addTextboxWrapper. \nIf we add a new EscherTextbox we need to tell about it to the owning PPDrawing\ncontainer.\n\n (2) TextBox shape is implemented. It depends on Bug 39177 (TextRun.setText sets\nincorrect length of text in the underlying StyleTextPropAtom).\nSo this bug becomes a blocker.\nNick, do you have serious reasons to delay commit with its fix? \nI'm ready to discuss it or take responsibility to write more tests, etc. \n\n (3) A quick how-to guide on how to work with shapes in HSLF.\n(See src\\documentation\\content\\xdocs\\hslf\\how-to.xml)\nIf see that the English is clumsy or there are errors please change them without\nhesitation.\n\n (4) src\\scratchpad\\src\\org\\apache\\poi\\hslf\\data\\empty.ppt\nChanged document properties, set Author and Company to Apache Software Foundation.\n\nBest Regards, Yegor Kozlov", "tags": [], "bug_id": 39256, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 87712, "time": "2006-04-09T16:53:30Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2006-04-09T16:53:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39256, "attachment_id": 18046, "text": "Created attachment 18046\npatch with changes", "id": 87713, "time": "2006-04-09T16:54:22Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2006-04-09T16:54:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39256, "attachment_id": 18047, "text": "Created attachment 18047\narchive with the affected source code", "id": 87714, "time": "2006-04-09T16:55:27Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2006-04-09T16:55:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "text": "Thanks, I've committed this with only a few tweaks (mostly to comments).
