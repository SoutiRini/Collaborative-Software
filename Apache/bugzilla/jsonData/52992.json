It's rather cracking than improvement - because of my very limited time I was not able to code it better as I don't know FOP well enough. I hope that FOP developers will implement that solution making it more universal. \n\nFind attached modifications. I've used proper metric (src/codegen/fonts/Helvetica*.xml) provided by Bogus\u0142aw Fries (he accept this contribution) and altered some source files from src/java/org/apache/fop/pdf, all modifications are surrounded by:\n    // <tjudycki>\n    // </tjudycki>\nThe last modified file is build.xml - parameter encoding is set to CEEncoding instead of WinAnsiEncoding.\n\nThe solution is described here http://tv.com.pl/stepbystep/fop_pdf/\n\nRegards,\n\nTomasz Judycki"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52992, "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "id": 157489, "time": "2012-04-07T01:43:49Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:43:49Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
