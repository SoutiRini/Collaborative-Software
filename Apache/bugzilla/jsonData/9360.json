[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9360, "text": "I have a couple of classes that have static methods that are invoked for XSL \ntransformation. This works fine with Tomcat 4.0.1. In 4.0.3, the method is \nnever invoked and no exceptions are thrown at that statement, and the flow just \nstops there. I created another class that can be instantiated with no static \nmethods, the Object does not get instantiated, all other Object and method \ncalls work fine.\n\nsome code from that part \n\n//*************************\nSystem.out.println(\"came after Null in  DB before transform \"); \nhtmlData = com.pulsar.players.xml.XMLUtilitiesNew.transform(this.getXSLPath\n(),currentXML);\n\n//*********\n\nThe print statement is executed , even \"this.getXSLPath()\" is executed but it \ndoes not go into the method!!\n\nIt baffled me a whole day, in a debugger this code works fine, but when it is \nexecuted through Tomcat 4.0.3, it failed again and again and ...\n\nThe quandry I am in is that the app I am developing works fine, but do not have \nthe source or an executable for verion 4.0.1, which I would need for any \ndeployment!!!\n\nI will try reinstalling 4.0.3 and see if there is any difference.
