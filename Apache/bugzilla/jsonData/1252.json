This program has recently\nbeen enhanced and now complains about a \"security exposure\" in the standalone\nHTTP server included with Tomcat.  Specifically, it sends this HTTP request:\n\nPOST / HTTP/1.0\nContent-Length: %s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s\n\n(with an extra \\r\\n on the end to denote an empty body)\n\nThe idea here is to test for a badly-written C program the uses the given\nstring as a printf() pattern string (see http://julianor.tripod.com/tn-usfs.txt\nfor more information on these types of programs).\n\nTomcat reacts to this request by closing the socket, giving no response.  The\nsecurity program interprets this as a failure; it presumes it managed to crash\nthe server.  The security program is, of course, misinterpreting the result.\nTomcat does not crash.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that Tomcat should be\nresponding with \"400 Bad Request\" instead.  If the security program receives\nany response at all, the server \"passes\" the test.\n\nI know this is a nit, but it would be very helpful to me if it were fixed.\nI haven't tried this on Tomcat 4."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "cmanolache@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 1797, "time": "2001-04-09T15:22:45Z", "bug_id": 1252, "creation_time": "2001-04-09T15:22:45Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Fixed in 3.3."}]
