Just found some time to reinvestigate the issue in detail.\n\nMy report is actually invalid as it turns out. For the 32-bit builds all is working fine and for the 64-bit builds which I ran into the build issue which led to this bugreport, it was actually my converted 64-bit project which was incorrectly set up.\n\nI just learned that the proper extension name for modules is .so also on Windows so instead of the makefile change depicted here, the proper way to fix my issue is for me to correctly set the output file for the mod-projects to *.so (which I olverlooked).\n\nSorry for the noise and thanks for taking the time to check on the report."}]
