Debug code is buggy when: (1) it causes abnormal termination or (2) it fails to tell you what to do to fix your code. So, based upon this definition of buggy debug code, I would set the severity at least no less than \"normal.\"\n\nSecond, even if you leave the Severity as \"enhancement\" you can still meet an earlier Target Milestone if you simply enumerate the list of files are when you render the \"newest source\" and the \"oldest target file\". Something like this:\n\nFileResource \"somefile\" is the newest source of {\"filea\" [mtime], \"fileb\" [mtime],...}\n\nWho cares if the list is long?
