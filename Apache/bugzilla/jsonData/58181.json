[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58181, "is_private": false, "text": "i would like to give documents a higher freshness timeout when they haven't been modified for a long time. documents, that have a more recent modifications time should have a lower freshness timeout. So I would like to do something like:\n\nExpiresByType text/html \"now minus modification\"\n\nThe primary problem here is that mod_expire does only support \"plus\" and not \"minus\". There was a patch for minus here: https://paste.apache.org/aLzH but I didn't test that. Any reason why \"minus\" for a use case like this is not supported?", "id": 184169, "time": "2015-07-25T16:25:41Z", "creator": "bjoern@j3e.de", "creation_time": "2015-07-25T16:25:41Z", "attachment_id": null}]
