While these are not typically used in config files - they are valid whitespace characters, and not all editors display them as a special character. (TextMate2 and Eclipse do while VIM and EMACS do not). Some editors also insert them automatically which is how they made their way into our config files to begin with.\n\nThe expected behavior would be to have Apache treat these characters like any other whitespace character and operate normally without resetting connections.\n\nThanks!\nMichael"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54869, "text": "what files / directives?
