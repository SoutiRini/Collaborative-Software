As such, some issues with the prior\nimplementation concerning performance and synchronization have been eliminated.\n\nBackwards compatibility has been maintained.  Some methods no longer serve a\npurpose (e.g. remove()) but remain for backwards compatibility.  Also, a child\nthread needs to explicitly inherit a parent thread's context, as was the case\nbefore the change.\n\nAlso included is a simple test case for the NDC class.\n\nI will post CVS patches as attachments ASAP."}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 9796\nCVS patches for NDC enhancement", "bug_id": 25890, "attachment_id": 9796, "id": 50030, "time": "2004-01-04T23:30:58Z", "creator": "rdecampo@twcny.rr.com", "creation_time": "2004-01-04T23:30:58Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 9797\nJUnit test case for NDC", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 25890, "id": 50031, "time": "2004-01-04T23:31:42Z", "creator": "rdecampo@twcny.rr.com", "creation_time": "2004-01-04T23:31:42Z", "attachment_id": 9797}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "rdecampo@twcny.rr.com", "attachment_id": 9798, "is_private": false, "id": 50032, "time": "2004-01-04T23:32:11Z", "bug_id": 25890, "creation_time": "2004-01-04T23:32:11Z", "text": "Created attachment 9798\nWitness for JUnit NDC test case"}, {"count": 4, "text": "Created attachment 9799\nProperties for NDC test case", "bug_id": 25890, "attachment_id": 9799, "id": 50033, "time": "2004-01-04T23:32:53Z", "creator": "rdecampo@twcny.rr.com", "creation_time": "2004-01-04T23:32:53Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
