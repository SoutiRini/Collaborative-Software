[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53595, "text": "When server quality values are specified in either a type map or AddType directive as a \"qs\" media type parameter for use by MultiViews during content negotiation, the \"qs\" parameter is sent with the media type to clients (e.g. in the Content-Type header).  This appears to be in violation of the IETF RFCs as no registered media type has a \"qs\" parameter and RFC 2616 does not include it in the grammar for the Content-Type header.\n\nIdeally either the \"qs\" parameter would be removed, or MultiViews would provide an alternative mechanism for specifying server quality values which does not involve changing the media type.\n\nThis problem was originally brought up in 2002 on httpd-users[1] and http-dev[2], and it was also discussed on ietf-http-wg[3] and I recently raised the issue on httpd-dev before filing this bug report[4].\n\nI realize the chances of this bug being fixed are slim, but I am opening this bug report so that progress can be tracked, it can be more easily found by people affected, and to keep it visible to those who might be able to fix it.\n\nCheers,\nKevin\n\n1. http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-users/200202.mbox/%3CELEDJONBOPPAEGANDEEIKEEKCBAA.joshua@slive.ca%3E\n2. http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200202.mbox/%3C0adf01c1b994$645169c0$94c0b0d0@v505%3E\n3.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2002AprJun/0032.html\n4.  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/201207.mbox/%3C20120720175741.GB25068%40kevinzilla%3E", "id": 160866, "time": "2012-07-24T16:25:16Z", "creator": "kevin@kevinlocke.name", "creation_time": "2012-07-24T16:25:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
