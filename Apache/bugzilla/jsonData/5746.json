The <exception-type> element is used for assigning\nerror pages to exceptions.  The Servlet 2.2 doesn't say much about how the\nhandling should work. The Servlet 2.3 does address this area and I am assuming\nthat it is appropriate to take the Servet 2.3 spec as a clarification of what\nServlet 2.2 should have implemented.  The Servlet 2.3 spec states in SRV9.9.2:\n\n    If a servlet generates an error that is not handled by the error page\n    mechanism as described above, the container must ensure the status code of\n    the response is set to status code 500.\n\nThis says the 500 status code is applied after the handling, and doesn't\nimply that another pass through the handling should be done.  Thus, unhandled\nexceptions won't be redirected to your specified \"500\" error page.\n\nSince sendError(500) works, I'm marking this as WORKSFORME.
