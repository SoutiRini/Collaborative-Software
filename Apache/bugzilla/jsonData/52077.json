[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nWe have configured Jboss to initialise Log4j with our log4j.xml rather than use Jboss's inbuilt log4j.We are using RollingFileAppender which is set up to rollover the log file on reaching a size limit of 1MB.The rollover happens without any issues.We see a weird issue after the rollover.For ex:Rollover happens and we have to files - server.log.1(1 MB) and server.log(6 KB).Now if our application logs anything the new log entries go to server.log but the existing log entries are overwritten.The logs start from the start of the file rather than append to the bottom.The old log server.log.1 remains as it is.\nThis happens randomly and most of the time when the new log size is quite small.\n\nSince Jboss comes with its own log4j set-up I have tried to increase Jboss server logging to see if Jboss is initialising the appenders again even though we are using our own log4j.xml.So far I haven't seen anything of that sort happening in the jboss logs.Has anybody come across this issue or is this a known issue with log4j.\n\nSuhana", "attachment_id": null, "id": 150877, "creator": "suhanamathoor@gmail.com", "time": "2011-10-24T16:38:31Z", "bug_id": 52077, "creation_time": "2011-10-24T16:38:31Z", "is_private": false}]
