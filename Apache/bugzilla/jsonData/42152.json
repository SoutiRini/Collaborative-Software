The JVM\nshould insulate Tomcat from such issues and therefore I do not believe this is a\nTomcat issue.\n\nAn upgrade to the latest Sun JVM may help.\n\nSince it appears you take security issues seriously you might also want to\nconsider the unpatched vulnerabilities in Tomcat 5.0.x. See\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/security-5.html for details. Even with 5.0.30, there\nare at least 3 important vulnerabilities. An upgrade to the latest 5.5.x would\nresolve these.\n\nIf you need further assistance with this issue please use the Tomcat users\nmailing list.\n", "tags": [], "bug_id": 42152, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 101911, "time": "2007-04-18T19:42:20Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-04-18T19:42:20Z", "attachment_id": null}]
