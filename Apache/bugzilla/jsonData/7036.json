But since Mozilla use Unicode to display Multibyte characters\nso it refuses to process raw Big5 data, that's why my data get cut (my guessing).\n\nBut if I paste UTF-8 Chinese data into Mozilla(en), then the getParameter will\nget the data. However, what kind of data that is actually sent out depends on\nthe encoding of the current editing page.\n\nSo here is the case:\npage encoding data entered data received\n-------------|----------- |-----------|\n  UTF-8          UTF-8        UTF-8\n  BIG5           UTF-8        BIG5\n  GB2312         UTF-8        GB2312\n---------------------------------------\nI didn't use request.setCharacterEncoding because Forte for Java 3 doesn't\nsupport j2ee 1.3.1 yet. I believe it should work, as long as you know what kind\nof encoding data you are receiving.\n\nIf it's on Chinese OS, then I could enter Chinese directly(big5 or gb2312), I\nguess Mozilla did the conversion base on the default locale before it sends the\ndata.\n\nIE6 works the same way as mozilla.
