In this case there is nothing to validate.\n\nIf the vaue is string then it is up to you how to check: you can fetch the string value and check it against a regex or write a validator yourself.\n\nthe code might look as follows:\n\n        switch(cell.getCellType()){\n            case Cell.CELL_TYPE_NUMERIC:\n                date = cell.getDateCellValue();\n                break;\n            case Cell.CELL_TYPE_STRING:\n                String sval = cell.getStringCellValue();\n                if(sval.matches(\"\\\\d\\\\d/\\\\d\\\\d/\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\")){  // dd/mm/yyyy\n                    // parse as a date\n                }\n        }\n \nnote that internally Excel stores dates as numbers, that is why the first case is Cell.CELL_TYPE_NUMERIC'\n\nYegor"}]
