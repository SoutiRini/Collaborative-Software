So when these files are built into the \napplication ear and pushed to another server (not exploded)...I receive errors \nbecause the Catalog xml files cannot be found.\n\nIt appears that CatalogManager.readProperties correctly retrieves the \nCatalogManager.properties:\n\nCatalogManager.class.getResource(\"/\"+propertyFile);\n\nWhich correctly works for jar'd files.\n\nBut the CatalogManager then uses the file system to retrieve the Catalog xml \nfiles in CatalogManager.getCatalogFiles():\n\nabsURI = new URL(propertyFileURI, catalogFile);\n\nThis is causing my application to fail because the when my ear is deployed, the \njar files containing my code/properties/xml files, is not exploded to the file \nsystem.  Therefore it cannot seem to find the Catalog xml files, but does find \nthe CatalogManager.properties file.\n\nSorry if I created this incorrectly with the severity, I am new to this.  But \nif this is an issue, I have to implement a work around immediately.  Any help \nwould be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n-jay"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33070, "text": "Just additional information.\n\nThe CatalogManager.properties file is in one jar and the Catalog xml files are \nin different jars.
