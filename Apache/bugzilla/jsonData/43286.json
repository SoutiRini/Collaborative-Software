The problem is \nthat I can not install php into folder \"C:\\Program Files\\...\". The space here \nbroke the php library dependency. Install to \"C:\\php5\" is fine.\n\nThanks!", "creator": "koifans@shaw.ca", "attachment_id": null, "id": 107677, "time": "2007-09-04T01:28:37Z", "bug_id": 43286, "creation_time": "2007-09-04T01:28:37Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
