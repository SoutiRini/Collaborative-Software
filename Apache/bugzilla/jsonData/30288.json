I couldn't find an ant core\ntask or optional task to do this. So, I have written my own, I am willing to\ndonate this task to the ant project if you are interested. I will also document\nit and do whatever you deem necessary to make it \"production\" level. If you do\nnot feel this should be incorporated into a future version of Ant please let me\nknow and then I will just make the code available on my website for others to\nuse from there."}]
