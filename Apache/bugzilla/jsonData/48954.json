I can't comment on the functionality itself, but I noticed a few general issues:\n- the new EncodingTriplet class is missing from the patch. You must svn add the new class before creating the patch\n- there are other compilation errors: a new parameter was added to AbstractPageObject.createTagLogicalElement but the corresponding method calls haven't been updated. Likewise for the TagLogicalElement constructor\n- the method AbstractTripletStructuredObject.setFullyQualifiedName is no longer visible\n- there are some checkstyle issues in the new code\n\nIn AFPPageSetup:\n- there is a setter for encoding, so that field can be made private\n\nIn AFPPageSetupElement:\n- catching Exception is evil (in most cases). In this case I suppose you just want to catch NumberFormatException\n\nIn TagLogicalElement:\n- do you really want to store the encoding as an Integer? IIUC the int value is wrapped into an Integer in AFPPageSetup and then unwrapped in TagLogicalElement.setEncoding. It seems to me that the int value could directly be passed around\n\n\nThanks,\nVincent", "tags": [], "bug_id": 48954, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 135617, "time": "2010-03-25T11:16:34Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-03-25T11:16:34Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "peter.hancock@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 25184, "text": "Created attachment 25184\npatch of implementation with suggested fixes\n\nPatch updated from Vincent's initial response", "id": 135633, "time": "2010-03-25T17:00:02Z", "bug_id": 48954, "creation_time": "2010-03-25T17:00:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "peter.hancock@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi Vincent,\n\nI taken on board all off your directions and suggestions.
