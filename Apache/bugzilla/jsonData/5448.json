[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5448, "text": "This is a major refactoring of the Star Team tasks, based on some code that was contributed by the Cruise Control team.  It deprecates the old <starteam> task, replacing it with a much simpler <starteamcheckout> task.  It also features a <starteamlabel> task.  The enhancements in the old task were backported into the Cruise Control code.  This framework implements a visitor pattern which should enable a checkin task to be written in short order.
