[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I was asked by somebody in the office to extend JMeter so that when running\ntests, and threads stop (due to failure) to make a way to restart the thread. \nWhat I have done is to create a new Visualizer that lists all the running\nthreads, and allows you to right click on them in the list and stop/restart\nthem.  However, this required a few changes to the way JMeter works.  \n\n1.    When the initial parsing of the test tree occurs, a new\n\ntraverser was added that passed an instance of the engine being used to all test\nplan tree objects that are derived from AbstractVisualizer.\n\n2.    AbstractVisualizer was extended to receive the engine instance.\n\n3.    StandardJMeterEngine was extended to be able to restart threads,\n\nand accept JMeterEngineMonitors.\n\n4.    JMeterThread was extended to fire events to JMeterThreadMonitor\n\n(which was also extended) to indicate when it started.\n\n5.    A new class JMeterEngineMonitor was created to monitor when\n\nengines create threads, when their threads are stopped, and when the test\nstarts/stops.\n\n6.    New visualizer class ThreadWatcherVisualizer, and\n\nThreadWatcherTableDataModel were created for the GUI.\n\n7.    messeages.properties was modified to add the extra strings for\n\nthe visualizer.\n\n\nThe visualizer is used by addeding it to the test plan, then when a test is\nrunning, you can see/change the running status of all the threads.\n\nWhen all threads are stopped - the test stops.  I have attached a patch file to\nthis email. \n\n- Nnamdi", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 36378, "id": 79049, "time": "2005-08-26T14:02:49Z", "creator": "patrick.onyeyiri@corizon.com", "creation_time": "2005-08-26T14:02:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36378, "text": "Created attachment 16210\nPatch file", "id": 79050, "attachment_id": 16210, "creator": "patrick.onyeyiri@corizon.com", "creation_time": "2005-08-26T14:03:59Z", "time": "2005-08-26T14:03:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36378, "attachment_id": null, "id": 89510, "time": "2006-05-26T00:08:45Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-05-26T00:08:45Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 37811 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 3, "text": "Yannick said me privately that changing the Product entry was not what he wanted to do.", "bug_id": 36378, "is_private": false, "id": 135785, "time": "2010-03-30T09:18:11Z", "creator": "pascal.sancho@takoma.fr", "creation_time": "2010-03-30T09:18:11Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36378, "attachment_id": null, "id": 160713, "time": "2012-07-18T10:51:04Z", "creator": "TIGAROCKS@GMAIL.COM", "creation_time": "2012-07-18T10:51:04Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Hi Guys,\n\nThis seems to be a great feature! and has been on the shelf for a while.\n\nAny news on when then patch can be applies?\n\nCheers,\n\nRavi"}, {"count": 5, "text": "As far as I can tell, the suggested feature only works for GUI mode.\n\nAlso, a thread only stops due to failure if the test plan is configured to do so; normally a thread will continue running until the test ends.\n\nJMeter Thread Groups now support \"Start Next Loop\" on error.", "bug_id": 36378, "attachment_id": null, "id": 161860, "time": "2012-08-31T01:00:14Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-08-31T01:00:14Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
