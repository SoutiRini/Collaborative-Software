First I changed it back to \"&\" but XML validation failed. \nSo I typed \"&amp;\" what is of course \"&\" substitute in XML, and now everything \nworks OK.\n\nSo the solution is to write statement with URL in this form:\n\nconnectionURL=\"jdbc:mysql://localhost/authority?user=dbuser&amp;password=dbpass\"\n                                                           ^^^^^\n\nI hope it will help somebody.", "id": 12461, "time": "2002-03-28T15:58:26Z", "bug_id": 7580, "creation_time": "2002-03-28T15:58:26Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 7580, "is_private": false, "id": 14363, "time": "2002-04-22T20:46:30Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-22T20:46:30Z", "tags": [], "text": "Fixed.
