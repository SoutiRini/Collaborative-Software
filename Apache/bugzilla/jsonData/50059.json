[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "To reproduce:\n1. Make a Servlet 3.0 webapp (lets name it foo) with metadata-complete=\"true\" attribute set on the web-app element in the /WEB-IBNF/web.xml.\n2. Make a jar holding a single /META-INF/resources/index.html file. The jar should be placed in /WEB-INF/lib (lets name it bar.jar).\n3. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and in browser go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\n\nExpected result: 200 response and index.html served.\nActual result: 404\n\nIf you modify the web.xml to metadata-complete=\"false\" and restart the app now /foo/index.html will respond as expected.\n\nI tried the same webapp with Glassfish v3.0.1 and it works as expected regardless what I set in metadata-complete attribute.\n\nI made a quick look in the servlet 3.0 spec and as far as I can see metadata-complete only regulates annotation and web fragment processing. In the example bar.jar has nothing to do with annotations and it is not a web fragment either but it is still handled differently depending on the metadata-complete attribute.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 50059, "id": 140583, "time": "2010-10-08T07:57:25Z", "creator": "kiralyattila.hu@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-10-08T07:57:25Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the report.
