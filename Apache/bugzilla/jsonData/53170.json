The sampler parameters to be\npopulated are specified using (configurable) flags.  The HTML Result object to\nuse defaults to the previous response - however, a Result Store can be\nspecified, and it will be used instead.  \n\n\nI think a form-filler could be useful, particularly for forms with dynamic field names. Also for lists - it would be useful to be able to pick list items by number.\n\nIt would be useful to be able to refer to input fields by position as well as number.\n\nBut this needs a bit more thought on how to make this easy to use.\n\n\nSee patch proposal in issue 40011", "is_private": false}]
