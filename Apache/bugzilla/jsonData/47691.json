This prevents certain things that a user building httpd\nmight want to do.\n\nFirst off, --tag is not needed if the C or C++ compiler used during the build\nis identical (read: string comparison) to that used during configure time.\nThe libtool script then uses the appropriate set of values by matching the\ncompiler name.  This is less efficient than telling libtool which set of\nvalues to use by passing --tag, but not a problem.\n\nHowever, sometimes one wants to override the compiler at 'make' time, for\nexample to use purify as indicated above.  The error you then get from\n  make CC='purify gcc'\n\nis something like\n\n  libtool: compile: unable to infer tagged configuration\n  libtool: compile: specify a tag with `--tag'\n\nand could have been prevented with the following patch."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47691, "text": "Created attachment 27833\nfix the same problem for apxs\n\nPlease apply Ralf's patch, and also the one I'm attaching now which fixes the same problem for apxs.
