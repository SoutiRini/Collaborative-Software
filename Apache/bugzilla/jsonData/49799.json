This new feature of JSP 2.2 is described in the Specs in JSP.5.10.\n\nTable JSP.5-7 Attributes for the <jsp:attribute> standard action\n\nomit (optional) Valid values are true and false. If true, and when\nused with <jsp:element>, the attribute in the element being\nouput is omitted. Ignored when used with a standard or\ncustom action. Defaults to false.\n\nThere is an introduction text here: \nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=14471459\n\nand I'm trying to make this work in my setup but I'm failing. Or I don't get the point.\n\nThe following works:\n<jsp:element name=\"p\">\n\t<jsp:attribute name=\"style\" omit=\"true\" >color:red</jsp:attribute>\n\nThe following does NOT work:\n<jsp:element name=\"p\">\n\t<jsp:attribute name=\"style\" omit=\"<%=jspExpressionTrue%>\" >color:red</jsp:attribute>\n\nThe following does NOT work either:\n<jsp:element name=\"p\">\n\t<jsp:attribute name=\"style\" omit=\"${trueEL}\" >color:red</jsp:attribute>\n\nFull JSP code in my attachment. I actually use the JSP-document (XML / JSPX-)syntax, but it does not work in any of the JSP dialects.\n\n\nSo I don't get the point why I should not be able to use EL in the omit-attribute, because then it's kind of useless.\n\n\nI use\nWindows Vista 64bit\nJavaSE 1.6\nApache Tomcat 7.0.0 and Apche Tomcat 7.0.2beta\nJSTL 1.1.2\n\nAll setup together in a typical \"Dynamic Web Project\" in Eclipse 3.6 Helios", "id": 139349, "time": "2010-08-22T16:44:10Z", "creator": "Philipp.Jurewicz@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2010-08-22T16:44:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25926}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49799, "attachment_id": null, "text": "The expected behaviour is undefined since the EBNF in JSP.1.3.10.1 does not include the omit attribute at all.\n\nThe behaviour you are expecting sounds reasonable to me (even if it does make the code a tad more complicated than it is currently).
