[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 24860\nPatch against trunk r900635\n\nLdapExtSampler has two Hashtables: ldapContexts and ldapConnections. One should cache DirContext instances per thread, the other LDAPExtClient instances.\n\nBut inspection of the class LDAPExtClient shows, that all of it's method can be declared static. All data needed is always passed in as method arguments. So there's no need to use a Hashtable of instances. Also: the ldapConnections Hashtable wasn't filled correctly. So let's turn to static methods and remove the Hashtable.\n\nIt seems the ext ldap sampler was broken for more complex bind, search, unbind tests and at least those work with the patch applied.\n\nPatch is against trunk, but the same situation occurs in 2.3.4.", "attachment_id": 24860, "bug_id": 48573, "id": 133701, "time": "2010-01-19T07:56:23Z", "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2010-01-19T07:56:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Good catch:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=901444&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 48573 - LDAPExtSampler directory context handling", "attachment_id": null, "id": 133756, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "time": "2010-01-20T15:52:21Z", "bug_id": 48573, "creation_time": "2010-01-20T15:52:21Z", "is_private": false}]
