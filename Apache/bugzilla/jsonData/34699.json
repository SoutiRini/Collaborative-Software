We don't recommend or support this whole idea:\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#passwdauth\n\n2. The use of the <Limit> section is incorrect and dangerous:\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#limit\n\n3. It appears you are trying to use a 1.3 module in 2.0.  This will not work.\n\n4. The technique for adding third-party modules is documented here:\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/programs/configure.html#modules\n\n5. This is a question that should be directed to a user support forum like the\nusers at httpd.apache.org mailing list, not the bug database."}]
