It will alternatly read the servlet request input stream and decode the stream into parameters, then use getParameterNames() and getParameterValues() to read the parameters.  The two methods should return the same string.  (They do not).  \r\nIn my first testing against Catalina 4.0.b1 I notice extremely long response time, and the jvm associated with the servlet is spinning in execute state for up to 3 minutes whenever I read the servlet input stream before getting the parameter names and values.  When I read the parameter names and values, the jvm executes a normal amount of time."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 459, "text": "This bug should have been entered against Tomcat4.
