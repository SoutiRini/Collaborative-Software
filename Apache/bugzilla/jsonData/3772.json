It got its paws into my windows \nregistry.  I have removed the program since, but it left jdk/jre information in \nmy registry.\n\nThe problem I'm having with Tomcat is that it chose a jdk/jre when it \ninstalled, without letting me specify a different one.  In this case, I assume \nit pulled the information from the registry...as a result, when it tries to \ncompile JPSs, it fails because that jre doesn't actually exist, and I get a \nClassNotFoundException.\n\nI'll be able to get around this (I hope), but it's a major hassle than can \neasily be avoided in the future by allowing the installer to choose the jdk/jre \nlocation.  Maybe an improvement in jdk locator code would be to check for a \nwindows JAVA_HOME environment variable first, since this would generally be a \nbetter guess at what the user wants."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3772, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This problem will be fixed in a future version of the installer (the current \ntechnology doesn't allow this).", "id": 5909, "time": "2001-09-21T23:10:30Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-09-21T23:10:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 8301, "time": "2001-11-26T23:48:05Z", "bug_id": 3772, "creation_time": "2001-11-26T23:48:05Z", "tags": [], "text": "Reopen before marking as fixed."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3772, "attachment_id": null, "id": 8302, "time": "2001-11-26T23:49:58Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-11-26T23:49:58Z", "is_private": false, "text": "NSIS 1.58 and up supports reading environment variables.\nThe installer has been updated to use this (it will use JAVA_HOME first, and if \nit is not found, will try the registry).
