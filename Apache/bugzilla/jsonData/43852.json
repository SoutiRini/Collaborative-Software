After executing the JUnitReport task on \u00e1\u00e1\u00e9\u00e9\u00f3\u00f3.class, I've\ngot, for example, all-tests.html defined with charset US_ASCII (in the META\ntag), and including hyperlink references to\n\"/0_%C3%A1%C3%A1%C3%A9%C3%A9%C3%B3%C3%B3.html\", which looks like an URL-encoded\nUTF-8 encoding. (Also notice the '/' at the beginning, which makes my browser\nwant to locate file:///0_<class-name-here>, but I still have the main problem,\nbecause I tested with other pages too.) My browser couldn't find that file,\nprobably because $LANG is different to UTF-8, and i can tell for sure that I\nhave a 0_\u00e1\u00e1\u00e9\u00e9\u00f3\u00f3.html in the HTML output directory just the way it should be.\n\nCan you add support for HTML output encoding, perhaps with using system property\n'file.encoding' or what is better, please?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nUi.: I don't think this to be a high priority issue, since there is a belief\nthat a real software developer should use English-only symbol names anyway. I\njust don't like limiting myself to a specific character set when Java can handle\nencodings properly.\n\nAdditionally, though I have no problems with <junit> XML encoding, since it is\nencoded properly in UTF-8, however, someone might need the ability to change XML\nencoding. Probably it's a good idea to consider this too."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43852, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 110489, "time": "2007-11-13T09:47:26Z", "creator": "angrywolf@flashmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-11-13T09:47:26Z", "text": "Sorry, I spelled 'US-ASCII' incorrectly in the description.
