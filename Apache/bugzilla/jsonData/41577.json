From what \nI have been able to determine from researching this in various places - this \nbehavior is attributed to an ie \"bug\".  While this problem may manifest as a \nresult of an ie bug, that is irrelevant because this issue affects anyone \nusing ie who attempts access this type of application - seems to me to be a \nshow stopper limitation of Tomcat.  I certainly can't use a Tomcat version \nbeyond 4.1 until this is fixed in Tomcat, because I can't expect my customers \nto abandon using ie for Firefox.
