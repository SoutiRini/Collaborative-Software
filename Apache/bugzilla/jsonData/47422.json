This means the jars you need to build jbpm-web - which are not part of Ant and must be installed separately (they are not maintained by Ant developers either) - are simply not there.\n\nWithout information like where you've placed those extra jars on your filesystem and how you invoke Ant on the command line, there is no chance to help you out.\n\nPlease use the user@ant mailing list or the appropriate jbpm-web support channel for more help."}]
