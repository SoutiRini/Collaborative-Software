In older JDK releases, the message digest algorithm used was SHA-1. If this new option is not specified, SHA-256 will be used on JDK 7 Updates and later JDK family versions. On JDK 6 Updates, SHA-1 will remain the default but a warning will be printed to the standard output stream.\"\n\nAlso see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8038837.", "is_private": false, "id": 196567, "creator": "eric.friess@realobjects.com", "time": "2017-01-30T16:46:03Z", "bug_id": 60665, "creation_time": "2017-01-30T16:46:03Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60665, "is_private": false, "id": 197720, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2017-03-16T17:04:54Z", "time": "2017-03-16T17:04:54Z", "text": "has been added with commit c11dcf2"}]
