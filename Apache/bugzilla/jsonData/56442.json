[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56442, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I was attempting to deploy my war file with an endpoint annotation defined in it to my tomcat server. When I deployed it, I received no error messages, but the endpoint was returning 404.\n\nI switched to tomcat 7.0.52 and dropped the war file in there. I received a stack trace because one of the dependent classes was not included in the war file. Once I fixed the classptath problems, the error disappeared and the endpoint showed up. I moved this back to tomcat 8.0.5 and it is now working fine.\n\nThe problem is that the error does not show up in the log. An error on the dependent class needs to show up in the log to tell the deployer there is a problem with the endpoint instead of silently not standing it up.\n\nThis problem can be re-created by creating a basic endpoint with one dependent class not in the class path.", "id": 174759, "time": "2014-04-22T12:50:50Z", "creator": "thehl@corrisoft.com", "creation_time": "2014-04-22T12:50:50Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56442, "attachment_id": null, "text": "The CNFE is already logged with a clean install of 8.0.x.", "id": 174766, "time": "2014-04-22T15:41:30Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-04-22T15:41:30Z", "is_private": false}]
