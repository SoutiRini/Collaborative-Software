I cannot find such a Makefile in the Apache Httpd 2.0.49 distribution\n(probably missing from previous versions too), neither in the build directory,\nnor in the install directory. The makefile found in 'modules/ssl' doesn't make\nseem to be the one either, and there is non in the 'certs' directory of the\nbuild tree. Thus IMHO, neither the description of SSLCACertificatePath in the\nmanual, nor the explanation of the directive in 'ssl[-std].conf' file seem to\nreflect the reality of today.\n\n--- from the manual ---\nThe files in this directory have to be PEM-encoded and are accessed through hash\n filenames. So usually you can't just place the Certificate files there: you\nalso have to create symbolic links named hash-value.N. And you should always\nmake sure this directory contains the appropriate symbolic links. Use the\nMakefile which comes with mod_ssl to accomplish this task.\n-----------------------\n\nWhere can I find that makefile or a tool for creating those symbolic links?\nShouldn't such a tool be installed in 'bin/' together with 'httpd' and 'apachectrl'?\n\nBest Regards,\nRolf Sponsel"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28112, "text": "I think this makefile is a relic of the days before mod_ssl was part of httpd. \nShould we just remove the docs about it?", "count": 1, "id": 75919, "time": "2005-06-03T03:26:53Z", "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "creation_time": "2005-06-03T03:26:53Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28112, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This has been fixed in 2.0.
