The behavior of timers in Java cannot be specified in the JLS as the behavior is both hardware/OS dependent/NTP. Further more, certain configurations cause the call to go off CPU. On CPU support requires threads to return to the same core (depending upon which clock you\u2019re configured to use and which model/rev of CPU you are using). So, there are all kinds of subtleties than mean more often than not the values reported will be wrong\u2026 hopefully not significantly wrong but\u2026 And unfortunately there isn\u2019t much you can do about it but try to know which clock your kernel is configured to use and if NTP is running.\n\nRegards,\nKirk", "id": 177020, "time": "2014-08-08T14:43:51Z", "bug_id": 39860, "creation_time": "2014-08-08T14:43:51Z", "is_private": false}]
