[{"count": 0, "text": "Hi *,\n\nwe use Tomcat together with weblogic which enforces us to compile our jsp's \nmanually.\n\nAfter having compiled our jsp's with JSPC I tried to compile the generated \nsources and got the error:\ncannot resolve symbol org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspException\n\nE.g.:\n  public final void _jspx_init() throws org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspException {\n  }\n\nIn fact this class doesn't seem to exist in 4.1.18.\nThe same is true for version 4.1.24.\n\nI found the org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspException in version 4.01 (jasper-\nruntime.jar) and took that one additionally in my classpath which seemed to \nhelp.\n\nBut now I got the error:\nXXXXXX.java should be declared abstract; it does not define getIncludes() in \norg.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.\n\nMy next Error is after using JSPC I get source files with the size of 0 kb and \nalso being generated in the wrong dirctory (seems to be related to bug 18477).\n\nNow I am totally stuck. Any suggestions?\n\nI am not really sure wether to post this as three diefferent bugs or not. Hope \nthis ok.\n\nAndreas Ullmann", "bug_id": 18992, "attachment_id": null, "id": 35112, "time": "2003-04-14T12:22:28Z", "creator": "andreas.ullmann@start.de", "creation_time": "2003-04-14T12:22:28Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 35129, "time": "2003-04-14T17:16:52Z", "bug_id": 18992, "creation_time": "2003-04-14T17:16:52Z", "text": "If you have compiled your JSP pages with a older version of Jasper, and then try\nto compile your .java with a newer version of jasper, you'll get what you\ndeserved.
