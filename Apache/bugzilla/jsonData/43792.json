In my case the LDAP\ndirectory cannot be searched w/o successful authentication and for\nadministrative reasons we cannot afford to keep the user/pass pair in the\nconfiguration file.\n\nThe patch does not change the way, the actual authentication & following checks\nmade by the module work, but only make it fallback to the user supplied\nuser/pass pair on the 2x bind calls.\n\nPlease let me know whether this is considered a worthy feature at all, and I'll\nbe happy to provide a cleaner patch."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43792, "attachment_id": 21084, "is_private": false, "id": 110223, "time": "2007-11-04T09:58:54Z", "creator": "apache@tchorbadjiev.com", "creation_time": "2007-11-04T09:58:54Z", "text": "Created attachment 21084\nthe patch"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43792, "attachment_id": null, "id": 135384, "time": "2010-03-16T15:39:29Z", "creator": "peter.thomas@readi-systems.com", "creation_time": "2010-03-16T15:39:29Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Orthogonal to your suggested patch, but a possible alternative:  Can you use mutual SASL authentication over SSL/TLS as an alternative to a hard-coded or dynamic binddn and password?"}]
