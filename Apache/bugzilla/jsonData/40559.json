[{"text": "Apologies if you've seen this problem before, but I was unable to find it\nelsewhere so I'm sending it to you guys (see below).  I would really\nappreciate some help with this.\n\nBTW I couldn't find the link to bugzilla on the apr project home page, so\noriginally submitted it to the bugs@apr.apache.org list directly.  It would be\nhelpful if the reject message could give the bugzilla url (and if the project\nmenu could include a link to it).  It took some effort to find this site.\n\nThanks\n\nJess\n\nI'm trying to build apr-1.2.7, but there are warnings when running\nconfigure and when I later run make, it refuses to build altogether.
