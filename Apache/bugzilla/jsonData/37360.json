Then, when it attempts to register the service, it\ncannot find the executable so installation fails. \n\nIt is possible that distributing a 64-bit installer and binary will fix this\nproblem.", "id": 82135, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 37360, "creation_time": "2005-11-04T22:15:59Z", "time": "2005-11-04T22:15:59Z", "is_private": false}]
