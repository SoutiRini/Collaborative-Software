[{"text": "Created attachment 23283\nExcel Spreadsheet\n\nI received a classcastedexception when trying to execute the shiftRows method.  I have attached the spreadsheet that caused the problem.  All you have to do is open the workbook, get the sheet and try to shift some rows and you should get the exception.  To fix the problem I just added a try-catch.

POI currently does not adjust data validations during shiftRows().  If the shifted rows don't affect the data validation regions, this will not be a problem for you.  Otherwise, please open a new bugzilla to request that enhancement.\n\nData validations is one of several potential adjustments that POI doesn't do yet.
