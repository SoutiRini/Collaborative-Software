This is particularly important to us due to having multiple backends, where the inode will be different depending on which backend is used.  As a result we do not want the inode to be part of our etag.  Unfortunately, mod_dav_fs does not respect the FileETag directive, and always includes the inode as part of the etag.  This causes a problem for davfs2, which uses etags to determine if a cached file is still valid.  davfs retrieves files with a GET, which uses the etag defined by the core, but when doing a directory listing, uses PROPFIND, which uses the mod_dav_fs etag, which is then different.  This invalidates the cache of every file on every directory listing.  mod_dav_fs should respect the FileETag directive so that these etags match."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mharo@google.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 146436, "time": "2011-05-18T22:18:40Z", "bug_id": 51224, "creation_time": "2011-05-18T22:18:40Z", "text": "The use case for this bug is multiple servers using DAV with read-only files behind a load balancer."}]
