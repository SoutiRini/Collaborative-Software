[{"text": "FOP currently always creates a file ID in the PDF trailer even though it's optional. It is required mostly be PDF/A and PDF/X. It may make sense to disable the generation via a configuration item. We probably shouldn't disable it by default because some people may rely on it by now.\n\nSecond, the metadata date is always set to the current date even if it is given in an XMP packet. That also prohibits binary equality.\n\nAdding this would allow Forrest to produce the same PDFs from run to run so they don't cause SVN diffs all the time.", "tags": [], "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 137779, "time": "2010-06-21T08:38:57Z", "bug_id": 49479, "creation_time": "2010-06-21T08:38:57Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49479, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 157479, "time": "2012-04-07T01:43:37Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:43:37Z", "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review"}]
