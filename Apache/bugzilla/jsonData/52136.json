It also introduces a regex for finding the Junit test files, the reason I've done this is because some of the tests were being ignored because they didn't appear in a TestSuite. I also think the output produced by junit on the command line more readable.\n\nHowever, in order to use a regex (**/*TestCase.java), this means that any class in the test file that isn't intended to run (helper files or abstract classes) cannot be called *TestCase.java. I think that's a fairly well established tradition.", "attachment_id": 27895, "id": 151191, "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "time": "2011-11-04T14:21:20Z", "bug_id": 52136, "creation_time": "2011-11-04T14:21:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Patch applied in rev. 1198853:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?revision=1198853&view=revision\n\nI inferred from the patch the files that were renamed, in order to preserve Subversion history.
