In that project, some documentations are written in XML\nand converted to XHTML by XSLT.  In order for Apache HTTPD to recognize file\nextension and the file is properly content-negotiated, Japanese files are named\n*.xml.ja. We want the output XHTML file to be named *.html.ja.jis. Default\nconversion is to replace string after last dot with new extension so if we\nspecifiy html.ja.jis as an extension, the name will be *.xml.html.ja.jis. This\nis not a desirable name.  Nested mapper element will solve this problem.\n\nI'll attach the patch to implement it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11249, "attachment_id": 2515, "id": 20353, "time": "2002-07-29T09:25:22Z", "creator": "yoshiki@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-07-29T09:25:22Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 2515\nA patch to enable nested mapper element in style task."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11249, "attachment_id": null, "id": 55391, "time": "2004-04-06T12:54:25Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-04-06T12:54:25Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 7879 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11249, "attachment_id": null, "id": 55878, "time": "2004-04-16T08:37:35Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-04-16T08:37:35Z", "is_private": false, "text": "added in CVS."}]
