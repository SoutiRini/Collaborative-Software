[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59613, "text": "Hi, \n\nStaring from 2.2 (or even earlier?), mod_auth_ldap is renamed to mod_authnz_ldap. But the logging and helper messages of mod_authnz_ldap still refer to the old name, i.e., \"auth_ldap\".\n\nThe following patch makes the module name consistent to the users. It only changes the logging and helper messages, rather than data structures or function names (which are not visible to the users).\n\nThe patch changes the following 4 patterns:\n\n1. In mod_authnz_ldap, every authn/authz log is prefixed with\n\"auth_ldap authenticate:\" or \"auth_ldap authorize\"\nThe patch changes \"auth_ldap\" to \"authnz_ldap\"\n\n2. There are some logs use the prefix \"ldap authorize\" and the patch changes \"ldap\" to \"authnz_ldap\" (these has nothing to do with util_ldap.\n\n3. In addition, it changes \"auth_ldap\" to \"authnz_ldap\" in 3 helper message for the directives in this module. \n\n4. In comments where the old name is used.\n\nP.S. I examined all the log statement and helper message, so it should not introduce any inconsistencies.", "id": 191171, "time": "2016-05-22T20:25:51Z", "creator": "tixu@cs.ucsd.edu", "creation_time": "2016-05-22T20:25:51Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59613, "attachment_id": 33863, "id": 191172, "time": "2016-05-22T20:27:03Z", "creator": "tixu@cs.ucsd.edu", "creation_time": "2016-05-22T20:27:03Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 33863\nPatch against trunk"}]
