Common solutions are to use the \ntaskdef to declare your task, or, if this is an optional task, to put the \noptional.jar in the lib directory of your ant installation (ANT_HOME).\"\n\nsays nothing of the fact that one should place the required libraries of the \noptional task in the lib directory as well. \n\nFor example, I was trying to run the junit task when I got this message. After \nsearching the documentation I finally found the \"Required Libraries\" section of \nthe installation part of the ant manual. The message could have gotten me there \nquicker if it where more clear about all of the required libraries not just \nmentioning the optional.jar.\n\nGreat work with ant, btw!
