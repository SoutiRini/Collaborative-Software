I would not mind \nwriting these myself but I don't know where to start and how would the Ant \nApache organization recognize my code and if they will put it with their next \nrelease.\n\nPlease contact me by email address vshekhar@gmail.com\n\nThank you\nVinayak", "id": 80701, "time": "2005-10-03T16:12:15Z", "creator": "vshekhar@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-10-03T16:12:15Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36897, "attachment_id": null, "id": 80719, "time": "2005-10-03T21:54:31Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-10-03T21:54:31Z", "is_private": false, "text": "you'd probably be best served by coding this functionality yourself and making \nit available yourself.  the ongoing problem with the SCM libraries is that, \nfor most products, we lack testers in the Ant developer camp, which reduces \nour confidence in any changes we might release affecting those libraries.
