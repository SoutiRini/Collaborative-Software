Note that it\nis not possible to ship the renderer with these fonts as they are licenced by\nIBM (or thrid party font providers). The font files required depend on the fonts\nyou are using but you will require the code page file and character set files.\nThe application assumes that a code page file has a .CDP suffix and character\nset files have the suffix of the DPI (for example .240).\n\n2) Define the fonts you are using in the afp-fonts.xml file an instance of this\nXML document may contain definitions for an arbitrary number of fonts that are\navailable to the AFP renderer.

If Web Maestro Clay could add a link to the sourceforge site that would be great, and perhaps \npublicise to your user mailing list?\n\nThere is some basic documentation which I'll continue to enhance, and I plan to migrate to the latest \nrelease when available. At that point I'll be in contact again to see if you wish to take the renderer in \nhouse.\n\nRegards, Pete.", "id": 64368, "time": "2004-09-29T15:19:19Z", "bug_id": 31213, "creation_time": "2004-09-29T15:19:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31213, "attachment_id": null, "id": 155583, "time": "2012-04-01T06:29:10Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:29:10Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed"}]
