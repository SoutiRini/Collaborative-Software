He/she can't edit the / context\nvia the admin utility.  Can't delete and recreate it with the changes you want.\n   The admin webapp should tell you that you can't delete the / context and\npossibly offer a suggestion on the proper way to make your changes.  \n\nJust as important, \"ROOT.xml\" does not exist and there is also mention of\nneeding to create it to override the default docbase.\n\nI won't bother you anymore.  It's just that I'm fairly familiar with installing\n4.x versions of Tomcat and it took me an hour to figure out how to get this done\nand I was hoping to save future users the trouble.  To do this, I'd suggest the\nfollowing changes:  \n\n#1:  Allow the admin utility to edit the docbase of the / context (best solution).\n-OR-\n#2:  Create the ROOT.xml file as part of the install so the user at least has a\nhint of where to go.\n\n"}]
