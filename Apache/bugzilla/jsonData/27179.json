[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 27179, "text": "Hi all, \n \nI have the following problem with Apache-2.0.48 running perchild MPM: Two \n\"ChildPerUserID\" directives in my httpd.conf file: \n \nChildPerUserID  lala    lala    2 \nChildPerUserID  test    test    2 \n \nand of course \"ServerLimit\" and \"NumServers\" before. Then I have two vhosts: \n \n<VirtualHost 192.168.19.14> \n    AssignUserID lala lala \n    ServerName lala.com \n    ... \n</VirtualHost> \n \n<VirtualHost 192.168.19.14> \n    AssignUserID test test \n    ServerName test.com \n    ... \n</VirtualHost> \n \nWhen I now start apache, I get NO errors on console or error log, and I can \naccess my first virtual host \"lala.com\". But if I try to access \"test.com\" \n(both set in /etc/hosts file), I get no response from server, like a timeout. \n \nIf I switch those ChildPerUserID directives (so line with \"test\" as first \nentry), then I can access virtual domain \"test.com\", but not \"lala.com\" ... \nso only the first entry seems to be valid. \n \nHow can I solve this issue? Is this perchild module marked as stable, or still \nin development phase? \n \nGreetings and TIA, Matthias \n \nPS: I can see httpd processes running via \"ps\", both as \"lala\" and as \"test\".", "id": 52832, "time": "2004-02-24T01:14:41Z", "creator": "haim@gentoo.org", "creation_time": "2004-02-24T01:14:41Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 54328, "time": "2004-03-21T11:36:59Z", "bug_id": 27179, "creation_time": "2004-03-21T11:36:59Z", "is_private": false, "text": "In case it isn't obvious, no Apache developers have done any work with perchild\nin quite a long time, other than trying to keep perchild up to date with changes\nthat have been made to the other MPMs.  Please consider the current experimental\nmodule  as a proving ground for some good ideas, but something that should be\nleft alone by folks not interested in debugging problems in it.\n"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27179, "attachment_id": null, "id": 75882, "time": "2005-06-03T01:45:36Z", "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "creation_time": "2005-06-03T01:45:36Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Perchild -> Won't Fix."}]
