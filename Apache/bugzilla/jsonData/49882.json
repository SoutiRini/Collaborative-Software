Thus the application is busy waiting and uses 100% of CPU time.\n\nSee the attached patch to resolve this issue. Found in version 1.4.2.\n\nRegards,\nStefan"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49882, "text": "fixed in trunk r1089433\nI'll consider backporting to 1.4.x after the upcoming 1.4.3 release", "id": 145584, "time": "2011-04-06T08:52:03Z", "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-04-06T08:52:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49882, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 145597, "time": "2011-04-06T13:12:00Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-04-06T13:12:00Z", "text": "I'd actually suggest to @bug this in the doxygen and fix at 1.5.0/2.0.0, so\nthat authors can know that the 1.4.x API did *not* support empty pollsets?"}]
