[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45900, "text": "For security reasons,etc, it is a generally nice thing to be able to mount\na src tree read-only from another system, then be able to type \"make install\" on the destination system.\n\nThis fails, with the current apache 2.2.9 src.\n\n\nmv: cannot rename libaprutil-1.so.0.3.0 to libaprutil-1.so.0.3.0U: Read-only file system\n\nin addition, having ONE system with a writeable /usr/local/src, and then mounting it read-only everywhere else, has additional problems.\nI cant just copy the compiled src tree to somewhere else and do make install, because you have hardcoded the full src tree path in.\nPlease stop doing that. Please use relative paths, and stop having \"make install\" do anything but copy files from src to destination. If you must do temporary things, do it in the destination directory?\n\nIt should be noted that this sort of situation would be just as applicable, if you were doing all this on the same system, but had a \"trusted\" user do compiles, and an \"untrusted\" user doing \"make install\".  This would also have the src tree be read-only, while destination is writable.", "id": 121024, "time": "2008-09-26T10:32:22Z", "creator": "phil@bolthole.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-26T10:32:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
