The problem is that it's got an embedded document in the reply, with its own namespace.\n\nThe problem is that I can't xpath on that embedded reply. I believa that this is a known limitation on the xpath processor used in XPATH extractor/asserter. I've also seen the workaround, using localName() of the node. For my specific needs, this is not that usable, since I need to qualify my assertion on an attribute value.\n\nIn SoapUI:s xpath-asserter/extracter, you can define a list of prefix/namespaces for the xpath. That would really solve all my needs! Would that be a feasible enhancement for the JMeter xpath-asserter/extractor?\n\nI've attached an xml result below.\n\nThe xpath-assertion I would need is: \n\n//ns2:term[@ns2:id=\"W13105\"]\n\nand that would be easy enough if I just could define a prefix namespace pair, like in SoapUI:\n\n\"ns2\"     \"http://www.uc.se/schemas/ucOrderReply/\"", "id": 167382, "time": "2013-05-23T14:24:27Z", "creator": "ingemar.allqvist@input-consulting.se", "creation_time": "2013-05-23T14:24:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 30316}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "text": "This is already possible using property:\nxpath.namespace.config \nin jmeter.properties.\n\nSee:\nhttp://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#XPath_Assertion\n\n\nIf that does not work for you then please provide the full XML including namespaces, current attachement is not enough.", "id": 167437, "time": "2013-05-27T20:32:39Z", "bug_id": 55013, "creation_time": "2013-05-27T20:32:39Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55013, "text": "Thanks for your reply,\nYes, your suggestion sort of works for me.
