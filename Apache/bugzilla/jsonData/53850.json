I believe that this one is failing because the internal PNG file is actually embedded (as mime64 within the SVG).

And then if you could comment out what you think the error can be going from I can reduce the test case.

Both xpdf and evince from my linux station have a broken rendering engine. Opening the file from acrobat reader works as expected.
