I want to run some junit test cases in that. But \n<junit> ignores my <classpath>. I am using ant 1.6.5. I have the following \nlink \nhttp://ant.apache.org/faq.html#delegating-classloader\n\nBut none of the solutions gives me my solution. Actually I am running ant in \nan environment. So I can not:\n\n1) Run ant as ant -lib ..... as my build file is implicitly invoked.\n2) I can not put all external libraries I  need in ANT_HOME and also therefore \ncan not keep junit.jar in ANT_HOME .\n3) I can not set classpath as including junit.jar since I am in an \nenvironment. Actually I tried setting that also, but it does not work.\n\nAll I can do is to modify my build.xml. So as this page suggests I modified it \nas follows:\n\n <taskdef name=\"junit\"\n            classname=\"org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.JUnitTask\">\n      <classpath>\n        <pathelement location=\"HOME-OF/junit/junit.jar\"/>\n\t<pathelement location=\"HOME-OF/ant-junit.jar\"/>\n      </classpath>\n </taskdef>  \n\nBut this also does not work.
