But they have to be escaped.\n\nIn any case, apache 1.3 didn't support multibyte codepages for filespecs.\nIn apache 2.0, internally -everything- is a utf-8 name, and URL's can be\ngiven in internationally portable utf-8 (properly escaped, of course.)\n\nClosing as won't fix - move to apache 2.0."}]
