This is because the thread name includes the thread number.\n\nThis can be fixed by trimming the -nnn suffix.\n\nHowever, I think there are still some other matters that need to be resolved:\n- if the Listener is under a single thread, should a parent be used?\n- should samples be grouped by the original thread group name, or by the \ngenerated name - which has a numeric suffix? In the former case, thread groups \ncan be merged by choosing identical names. If the latter, then samples are \nalways segregated into thread groups. I think the former is more versatile.\n\nComments?
