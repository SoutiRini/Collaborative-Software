If you could\npost a bug on bugzilla with a bugzilla attachment that shows the problem that\nwould be extremely helpful to ensure the problem is remembered and fixed.\n\n   Thanks!\nThomas.DeWeese@Kodak.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 43074, "creator": "denis@fireflydesign.com", "time": "2003-08-21T05:22:09Z", "bug_id": 22614, "creation_time": "2003-08-21T05:22:09Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "This is fixed in CVS.", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 44658, "time": "2003-09-25T11:17:31Z", "bug_id": 22614, "creation_time": "2003-09-25T11:17:31Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
