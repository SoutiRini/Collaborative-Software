With\nOWA users can upload files. This is not working if https is used on both side\n(ie the browser talks https to apache and apache https to the IIS behind it).\n\nBy writing a small sslproxy that plays man in the middle we were able to dump\nthe content of the session and find, that it seems to have something to do with\nthe mime separator. With Opera and certain IE versions we don't have a problem.\nWe allways have a problem with Mozilla. The only visible difference in the dump\nwas the length of the mime separator."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "It looks like to me that you are affected by bug #37145.
