[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40087, "text": "It appears that starting with JK 1.2.8, the JKMount directive became case \ninsensitive.  Thus, I cannot simultaneously have Tomcat webapps named \"/foo\" \nand \"/FOO\" and connect them to Apache (on Unix).\n\nThe relevant code appears to be the function \"jk_map_put\" in the file \njk/native/common/jk_map.c .  There is a call to \"strcasecmp\" which used to \nbe \"strcmp\" in version JK 1.2.6.\n\nI am wondering if this case insensitivity is a bug or a feature?  It seems to \nme that case insensitivity is correct on Windows and incorrect on Unix.
