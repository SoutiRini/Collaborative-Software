To be more precise about my use case:\n\nI have REST style app that uses JSON and HTTP verbs for all client interaction.\n When I tried to use HTTP PUT, with Content Encoding of \"application/json\",\nMethod of \"PUT\", and added a request parameter with my JSON data (Value = empty,\nEncode = not checked, Include Equals = not checked), I got the following as the\nrequest:\n\nPUT /resources/employees/user1 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-lori-time-1: 1192051198765\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\nReferer: http://localhost:8080/\nCache-Control: no-cache\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\nPragma: no-cache\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7)\nGecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7\nKeep-Alive: 300\nAccept:\ntext/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5\nHost: localhost:8080\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nWith no body.
