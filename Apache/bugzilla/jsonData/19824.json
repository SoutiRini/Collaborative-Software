One just has to add\ninsert a Resources element in the server.xml enabling it, e.g.:\n\n  <Context ....>\n     <Resources allowLinking=\"true\"/>\n  </Context>\n\nUnfortunately, this is not documented in the Tomcat docs.  Only by reading\nsource code and doing specific Tomcat mailing list and google searches based on\nmy reading was I able to figure this out!\"", "id": 39491, "time": "2003-06-26T15:45:46Z", "creator": "bugzilla@hayo.de", "creation_time": "2003-06-26T15:45:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19824, "text": "This is now documented for the resources element.", "id": 79376, "time": "2005-09-04T23:44:30Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-09-04T23:44:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
