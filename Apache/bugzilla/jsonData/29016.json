[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29016, "text": "When using Apache 2.0.49 as a forward caching proxy with mod_disk_cache the \ncache over time breaks images (using IE 6). This can easily be repeated with \nthe www.microsoft.com homepage. Proxy this page, then proxy alternate pages. At \nsome point when returning to the microsoft page the cache will serve the page \nwith broken images (i.e. images are not loaded). This does not occur with \nmod_mem_cache and I have repeated it on two different systems, Win 2003 & \nWinXP. It occurs with a vanilla apache setup, no extra modules loaded (besides \nproxy and caching modules of course). It occurs regardless of cache size or any \nsetting I try with mod_cache or mod_disk_cache.\n\nThis may apply to other Apache 2.0.x versions. The problem did not occur with \n1.3.x. It renders Apache 2.0.x unusable for me as a caching proxy server unless \nI use only mod_mem_cache which not as desireable.", "id": 57493, "time": "2004-05-15T23:31:45Z", "creator": "webform001@lewis.com.au", "creation_time": "2004-05-15T23:31:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29016, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I see something similar with mod_cache and mod_disk_cache installed: the mime\ntype is not preserved.
