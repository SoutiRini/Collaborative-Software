See the attached *.fo file for an example. The page should have been broken before point 25 to fit on the page, but instead it is broken after this point and point 25 overflows the footer.\n\nAll the best,\nChris", "id": 123161, "time": "2008-12-08T04:22:08Z", "creator": "Chris.Dams.nl@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-12-08T04:22:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 23002}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46363, "attachment_id": null, "id": 145213, "time": "2011-03-23T06:52:40Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-03-23T06:52:40Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 49608 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "See simpler test case attached in bug #49608", "id": 145214, "time": "2011-03-23T06:54:44Z", "bug_id": 46363, "creation_time": "2011-03-23T06:54:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46363, "text": "\nWithout even looking at the code, I can almost feel what is the issue here (see also my notes about the partial cause for Bugzilla 49801): ElementListUtils.calcContentLength(), which is used in list-layout to generate the 'list-parts'.\nDuring element-list buildup, this method calculates a content-length that does not take into account space-resolution (i.e. all the spaces are still unresolved SpaceElements).\nBy the time the algorithm has to compute the most optimal break, those elements will have been resolved. Some may have disappeared, others add a forced space of a certain width.\n\nSomething similar is bound to pop up for table-cells, sooner or later, as it also uses calcContentLength().\n\nBTW: it just occurred to me that we may want to have that method return a MinOptMax, rather than an int. As such, it could more easily take into account stretchability of spaces, without necessarily having to know more about the actual breaks or space-resolution...?", "id": 145218, "time": "2011-03-23T13:10:19Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-03-23T13:10:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "id": 157336, "time": "2012-04-07T01:41:39Z", "bug_id": 46363, "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:41:39Z", "is_private": false}]
