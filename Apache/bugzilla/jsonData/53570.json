This was actually fixed some time ago by Andreas. However during that investigation it was found that if no url wrapper was specified when using a application/PDF uri, a null pointer exception was thrown . This was because the DataURIResolver class was leaving the systemID value null which was being read and used by FOP later. I have now passed in the extra parameter of the uri to set the systemID and updated the test case to ensure that this problem is avoided regardless of where and how it is used."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 160864, "time": "2012-07-24T14:21:15Z", "bug_id": 53570, "creation_time": "2012-07-24T14:21:15Z", "tags": [], "text": "Committed to r1365074.
