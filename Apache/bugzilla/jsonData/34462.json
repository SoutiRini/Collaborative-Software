[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 34462, "text": "Having worked with ant for several years and versions, and reading the FAQs it \nseems that the optional.jar as well as its broken out form have caused a \nnumber of problems. Wouldn't it simply life for everyone if the optional tasks \nwere simply distributed in a different directory and therefore not loaded with \nthe system classloader at ANT startup? It is a real pain to work with ANT on a \ndevelopment system where mere developers aren't allowed to monkey \nwith \"system\" software. In an attempt to create some ANT scripts for a \nproject, I had to get the admins to modify the global profile information so \nthat I could use JDepend and JUnit. It shouldn't be that hard to use such \nfundamental tools with ANT.\n\nIf the optional jars were in a separate directory, then it would be a simple \nmatter of an antlib taskdef that would load the task information and the \ndependent jar at the same time. This solves several problems that have \nrequired a number of email messages on the mailing list and a FAQ question or \ntwo.\n* Optional jars aren't loaded unless they are needed.\n* Instructions are consistent for the optional jars and 3rd party ANT tasks \nmaking it far simpler to understand.\n* Class loader problems are eliminated because the task code is not loaded at \nANT startup.\n* It doesn't require system administrator privileges to use JUnit and JDepend \ntype tasks in a shared development environment.", "id": 73670, "time": "2005-04-14T23:52:11Z", "creator": "jltharp@att.com", "creation_time": "2005-04-14T23:52:11Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
