Clicking an item in Frame 3 sends 2 actions to the server. Action 1\ncauses frame 2 & 4 to get updated and action 2 causes frame 5 to get updated.\nThe problem is that frame 5 doesn't always get updated unless you click on the\nitem 2 or more times. Here is some code and javascript being used to send the\ncommmands to the server.\n\nonclick=\"javascript:loadFrames(<action commmand mid>,<action command bottom>)\"\n\nfunction (mid,bottom){\n  parent.frame_mid.location = mid;\n  parent.frame_bottom.location = bottom;\n  parent.frame_bottom.reload(true);\n} \n\nmid & bottom parameters are actually action commands of the following form:\n\n/Controller&cmd=call_list&id=xyz\n\nThe first statement always works without fail but the second doesn't. Can\nsomeone PLEASE give me clue as to what the hell is going on. I have searched for\nand tried every variation that I could find but no luck. \n\nDo I need to make the overridden service() function synchronized so the server\nthreads process everything in order?", "id": 41917, "time": "2003-08-01T00:41:21Z", "creator": "kevin.wilson@comtrol.com", "creation_time": "2003-08-01T00:41:21Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22039, "attachment_id": null, "id": 43624, "time": "2003-09-02T18:17:50Z", "creator": "yannc76@yahoo.de", "creation_time": "2003-09-02T18:17:50Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is not likely a bug with Tomcat, bug rather a browser/JS/Struts issue. \nPlease verify this problem exists *only* when using Tomcat as server before \nreopening."}]
