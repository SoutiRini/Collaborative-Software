The option to use the current behavior is still preserved.\n\nAdds a check box for static destinations to the JMSProducer sampler gui. If \"Use static destination\" is not checked then the destination the producer sends to will update each time the thread group loops. This way the producer can send to a different destination each time. If \"Use static destination\" is checked then the destination will be fixed the first time the thread group loops which is the current behavior."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50268, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 141709, "time": "2010-11-14T18:25:33Z", "creator": "milamber@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-11-14T18:25:33Z", "text": "Thanks for your patch.
