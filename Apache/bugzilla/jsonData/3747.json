Create two rows: 1st row contains \"param1\" and \"value1\". \n                    2nd row contains \"param2\" and \"value2\".\n2. Get into edit mode for the NAME column in row #1 by double-clicking on that \ncell. You should see a vertical bar in the text field.\n3. Click the DELETE button.\n\nThe expected result is for row #1 to be deleted, and row #2 moved up and into \nrow #1's place.  So, the table should now only have one row, with \nvalues \"param2\" and \"value2\".  Instead, our single row table contains the \nvalues \"param1\" and \"value2\".
