[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40011, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I have developed 4 new Test Elements for use in JMeter - figured i might as well\nsubmit them.  The four elements are:\n\nForm Filler (Pre Processor)\nResult Store (Post Processor)\nSystem Sampler (Sampler)\nMulti Value Regex Extractor (Post Processor)\n\nDetails about those elements:\nForm Filler (Pre-Processor): Extracts form elements from a HTML Result object,\nand then populates the sampler parameters.  The sampler parameters to be\npopulated are specified using (configurable) flags.  The HTML Result object to\nuse defaults to the previous response - however, a Result Store can be\nspecified, and it will be used instead.  \n\nResult Store (Post Processor): Takes the response object, and places it in a\nvariable.  The Result Store then places a reference to itself into the\nThreadContext, so that other elements can find and reference it.  Currently,\nonly the Form Filler (part of this collection) makes use of this Result Store.\n\nSystem Sampler (Sampler): A basic sampler object that can be used to execute\ncommands on the local machine.  Developed to allow the external processing of\ndata files part way through a test, it should allow execution of any command\nthat can be run from the command line.  In a basic attempt at completeness,\ncalls to sampleStart/sampleEnd are included.  Validation of the return code can\nbe enabled, and the expected return code can be specified.\n\nMulti Value Regex Extractor (Post Processor): An extension to the existing\nRegular Expression Extractor, the Multi Value version allows processing of all\nmatches.  Each match is formed into a template (as with the original version)\nbut afterwards, templates are strung together using a second configurable\ntemplate.  This element was implemented to allow for handling of multi-value\nHTML lists.\n\nTesting:\nThe elements have all been used in my current test scripts, but the testing has\nnot been too thorough - they were developed as a quick fix for specific problems\ni was having.\n\nSpecifically, the Form Filler has only been tested as a child to a single\nsampler.  It should work when placed at a higher level (each as child to a logic\ncontroller containing multiple samplers), but no guarantees :)\nThe Result Store has only been tested as a child to a single sampler.  It should\nprobably be restricted to this case, as it would not make sense for it to be\nused at a higher level (it can only hold one response object, so it should be\nunique for each sampler).  However, i am not currently certain of how to\nrestrict it.", "id": 91096, "time": "2006-07-11T09:21:24Z", "creator": "willinghamg@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-07-11T09:21:24Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40011, "attachment_id": 18585, "id": 91097, "time": "2006-07-11T09:22:02Z", "creator": "willinghamg@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-07-11T09:22:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 18585\nsource code for the new Test Elements"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "woolfel@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thank you for the contribution.
