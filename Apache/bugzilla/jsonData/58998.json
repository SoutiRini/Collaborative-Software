We should also add this to the API docs since it will cut down on debugging time for developers user the API for the websockets sendBinary method."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 188377, "time": "2016-02-11T22:16:08Z", "bug_id": 58998, "creation_time": "2016-02-11T22:16:08Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Is there anything actually unusual about this that would justify it ?
