Currently it seems there is no way to change this load order(eg. desc order or custom order). \n\nThe problem is, we have 5 applications of which one app exposes webservices. The rest 4 applications depends on the 5th application(which exposes webservice). When tomcat loads the applications, all 4 applications are listening/waiting for 5th app (app name starts with S) to startup. Hence there is a huge delay in starting the tomcat. It takes 15 to 20 minutes to start. \n\nIf there is an option to change this load order, it will be very helpful for people facing these problems.\n\nThanks,\nPalani"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This is a question for the users mailing list.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 45055, "id": 144413, "time": "2011-02-18T12:05:54Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-02-18T12:05:54Z", "attachment_id": null}]
