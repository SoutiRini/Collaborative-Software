[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47528, "text": "I'm using Apache 2.2.9, but I didn't find any changes in the newer versions that appear related to this issue.  I've set MaxRequestsPerChild to 500 in my Apache config.  If I watch the server-status page and refresh 500 times I see the PID for the process change and in my logs I see that the server restarted due to hitting hte max.  If I repeat this and go to 1000 requests no restart occurs, no matter how many more requests are issued the process doesn't restart.\n\nThis is a problem for us because the process seems to use more and more memory over time and since there is only a single process on Windows we are stuck with only 2 gigs to share between all the threads and our PHP code running on the server can tend to use lots of memory.  We end up with PHP running out of memory after the server has been up for a while and have to manually restart it.  I wanted to just use the MaxRequestsPerChild to gurantee we'd restart a couple times a day, but that isn't possible due to this bug.", "id": 128850, "time": "2009-07-14T13:32:09Z", "creator": "jmccaskey@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-07-14T13:32:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
