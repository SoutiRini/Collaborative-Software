However when\nI changed from using ant1.5.4 to ant1.6 my VSS get no longer works.  The\ncommand that I'm trying is:\n\n\t\t<vssget localpath=\"${new.starterpack.loc}\"\n\t\t\trecursive=\"true\"\n\t\t\tlabel=\"${vsslabel.starterpack}\"\n\t\t\tlogin=\"${vss.username},${vss.password}\"\n\t\t\tvsspath=\"${vsspath.starterpack}\"\n\t\t\tserverpath=\"${vss.starterSSDIR}\"\n\t\t\tautoresponse=\"Y\"\n\t\t\twritable=\"true\"\n\t\t/>\n\nThe error that I get back is:[vssget] Version not found\nFailed executing: ss Get $/path/to/Starter3.1 -D:\\\\Local\\\\Path\\\\Starter3.1\n-I-Y  -R -VL-L3.1.R12 -W -Yusername,*****\n\nThe params that are being passed in look like:\nvss.starterSrvr=servername\nvsslabel.starterpack=3.1.R12\nvsspath.starterpack=/path/to/Starter3.1\nvss.username=username\nvss.password=password\nnew.starterpack.loc=D:\\\\Local\\\\Path\\\\Starter3.1\n\nNow I read in the \"Whats New\" document that vss will no longer start off\nwith a '$' so I added that to my vsspath param:\nvsspath.starterpack=$/path/to/Starter3.1\n\nBut that didn't fix a thing.  In fact I get the same error.  So I'm\nofficially at a loss.  Is this a bug or am I missing something else more\nobvious?  And here's the kicker.  If I get rid of the '$' and change back to\nant1.5.4 everything works 100%.\n\nThis is what I get back from 1.5.4 with debug enabled:\n\nExecute:Java13CommandLauncher: Executing 'ss' with arguments:\n'Get'\n'$/path/to/Starter3.1'\n'-GLD:\\Local\\Path\\Starter3.1'\n'-I-Y'\n'-R'\n'-VL3.1.R12'\n'-W'\n'-Yusername,*******'\n\nI also tried the failonerror=\"false\" and it did finally get files but it\nseems to have ignored the label that I requested (this was with v1.6beta).\nWhen I do a diff in VSS between the labeled version and what ANT got there\nare several differences -- those differences being files that had been\nchecked in at a later date then the label.", "id": 45324, "time": "2003-10-09T22:10:04Z", "creator": "brentb@mmlive.com", "creation_time": "2003-10-09T22:10:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23711, "attachment_id": null, "id": 45343, "time": "2003-10-10T12:36:05Z", "creator": "antoine@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-10-10T12:36:05Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Ant 1.6beta seems to have a problem with the localpath part of the command line\n: -D:\\\\Local\\\\Path\\\\Starter3.1 instead of -GLD:\\\\Local\\\\Path\\\\Starter3.1\nI do not understand at a first glance where the problem comes from.\nMSVSSGET.java calls MSVSS#getLocalPath to build the argument localpath.
