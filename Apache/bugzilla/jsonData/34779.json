It seems \nthat the concatenation of the namespace and the name uniquely identify a value. \nBecause of this it is possible to delete values in other namespaces.\n\nFor an example of this behaviour try to set a property with namespace 'DAV:c' \nand name 'reationdate'. The 'DAV:creationdate' property will disappear.\n\nThis does not affect 'DAV:acl'. This is probably because it is stored different \nin the store than the other properties.\n\nI suspect the problem is in org.apache.slide.content.NodeRevisionDescriptor as \nit uses a concatenation of the namespace and the name without a special \nseparator as a key for the properties map.", "id": 74528, "time": "2005-05-06T14:30:51Z", "creator": "j.stuyts@hippo.nl", "creation_time": "2005-05-06T14:30:51Z", "is_private": false}]
