( XPath is a powerful method for selecting\n\nthings from XML files.\twww.w3.org/TR/xpath .)If the xpath is found and the\ndocument is parsable then the assertion is true.\nIt has the following three options.\n1. Validate (validate the xml against the DTD)\n2. Ignore Element White space.\n3. Tidy -Tidy feeds the file through the tidy, so that the xpath can be used\nwith HTML. \nIt also has an input field for matching XPaths, and a button\nto test weather the XPath expression is valid.\t\n\nThis patch could superceed XML Assertion as an XPath expression\nof / would do same thing as XML Assertion.  So this can both test\na document for well formed-ness and/or validness. \n\nIn order for this to superceed XML Assertion, it would need to be renamed\nXMLAssertion. In addition the message resources would need to be modified \nto reflect the menu correctly.\tSince XMLAssertion does not have any\nproperties, this should be otherwise compatibable.\n\nNote I posted a similar patch on the mailing list... my bad, but that\npatch requires jdom's XPath jars  which in turn depend on jaxen and saxen. \n\nThis patch has been rewritten to remove those dependencies.", "id": 69297, "time": "2005-01-06T22:46:06Z", "bug_id": 32976, "creation_time": "2005-01-06T22:46:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I've started adding this to the 2.0 branch.", "id": 69333, "time": "2005-01-07T11:53:20Z", "bug_id": 32976, "creation_time": "2005-01-07T11:53:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "jspears@astrology.com", "attachment_id": 13930, "text": "Created attachment 13930\nXPath Assertion addition of documentation and miscellinia.\n\n*Documentation has been added.\t\n*Made matching getter setter/methods, removed System.out.*\n*Reassigned log.debug/log.error/log.warn, to better reflect\n*Removed un-needed code in actionPerformed, and focusLost, focusGained\n*Removed unused variables.\n*Changed to Allow the setting of invalid XPaths (Not sure if this is a good\nthing), but in order to allow __functions to work, xpaths have sometimes to be\ninvalid.", "id": 69386, "time": "2005-01-07T19:54:37Z", "bug_id": 32976, "creation_time": "2005-01-07T19:54:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 32976, "text": "Created attachment 13936\nFixes synchronization adds negation\n\n*Made exception handling more specific.\n*Made the DocumentFactory and DocumentBuilder's synchronized\n*Added option to negate XPath, so one can have success if nothing is matched\n*removed final static ints not being used.\n*Added Layout manager to panel, so things layout better.\n*Updated documentation, and new screenshot.", "id": 69409, "time": "2005-01-07T23:40:21Z", "creator": "jspears@astrology.com", "creation_time": "2005-01-07T23:40:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 13936}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Code added to 2.0 branch.\n\nShould the validating builder throw an exception for warning and / or fatalError?", "id": 69437, "time": "2005-01-08T16:53:47Z", "bug_id": 32976, "creation_time": "2005-01-08T16:53:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 32976, "text": "Created attachment 13943\nXPath screenshot\n\nScreenshot for documentation.", "id": 69441, "time": "2005-01-08T20:52:27Z", "creator": "jspears@astrology.com", "creation_time": "2005-01-08T20:52:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 13943}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "jspears@astrology.com", "attachment_id": 14075, "text": "Created attachment 14075\nRefactored XPath assertion\n\nCreated new panels for the xml and xpath assertion.
