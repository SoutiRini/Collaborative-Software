[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Bug 32722 added test coverage analysis using Clover for the CVS HEAD.  This bug adds it to the \nv1_2branch.\n\nTest coverage analysis on the v1_2 branch should allow developers to identify compatibility issues that are \nnot tested in the current test suite so that tests can be added to check to insure compatibility between v \n1.2 and 1.3.  Instructions for use should be identical to CVS HEAD.\n\nModify tests/build.properties or specify -Dclover.jar to point to clover.jar.  Run tests/build.xml with target \n\"coverageReport\".  Currently ShortSocketServer has a  problem with finding clover.jar so those tests will \nfail, but when running for coverage analysis a test failure does not stop running the rest of the tests (since \ncoverage analysis can throw off some of the time sensitive tests).", "attachment_id": null, "id": 76867, "creation_time": "2005-07-01T06:37:29Z", "time": "2005-07-01T06:37:29Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "bug_id": 35572, "is_private": false}]
