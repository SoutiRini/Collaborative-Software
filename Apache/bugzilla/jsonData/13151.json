I'm still using the same IIS plugin that I used with \nTomcat 3.x and because it connects to AJP13 which Tomcat 4 still supports, it \nworks, but I'm not sure if there is a better way to do it with Tomcat 4 - \ndocumentation would be helpful. Thanks.\nAlso, I see no mention of the supposed new JMX admin front end in the 4.1.x \ndocumention. This new feature is hardly useful if there is no documentation \nabout it. I'm still using the old very simple text based admin front end where \nyou use the /manager URL and give simple commands like \"list\", etc. cause I \ndon't know any better.", "id": 23660, "time": "2002-09-30T17:55:21Z", "creator": "steve5m@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2002-09-30T17:55:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13151, "is_private": false, "text": "It is well known that open source projects lack good documentation.
