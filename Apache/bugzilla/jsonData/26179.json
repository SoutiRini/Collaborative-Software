When I try to run my code I get the following error:\nClassFormatError: Code attribute in native or abstract methods.\n\nI used BCELifier to regenerate a working class, and I get the same problem (so\nit's clearly a bug in BCEL).\n\nFor the ones unfamiliar with JNI, here is what I want to generate:\n\npublic class Test {\n\tpublic native static void run(Object a, String b, String c, String d, int e);\n\t\n\tstatic {\n\t\tSystem.loadLibrary(\"Test\");\n\t}\n}\n\nCould you please keep me informed by email about the status of this bug. Thanks.\n\nAlok Menghrajani\nalok.menghrajani@epfl.ch"}]
