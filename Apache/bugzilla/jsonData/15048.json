I suppose them to be shown in \nthe pdf one by one.  And, if the two images are size small enough, they can be \nplaced in 1 page together.  However, I find that no matter how small the images \nare, there must be a page break for each image.  The sample code is like this:\n:\n<fo:block page-break-before=\"avoid\" page-break-after=\"avoid\">\n  <xsl:for-each select=\"ADVICE/IMAGE\">\n    <fo:wrapper>\n     <fo:external-graphic>\n       <xsl:attribute name=\"src\"><xsl:value-of select=\".\"/></xsl:attribute>\n     </fo:external-graphic>\n    </fo:wrapper>\n  </xsl:for-each>\t\t\t\t\t\n</fo:block>\t\t\t\n:\n\nThen, I try to put another text block after the image block like this:\n<fo:block page-break-before=\"avoid\" page-break-after=\"avoid\">\n  <xsl:for-each select=\"ADVICE/IMAGE\">\n    <fo:wrapper>\n      <fo:external-graphic>\n\t<xsl:attribute name=\"src\"><xsl:value-of select=\".\"/></xsl:attribute>\n      </fo:external-graphic>\n    </fo:wrapper>\n    <fo:wrapper>Testing data line</fo:wrapper>\n  </xsl:for-each>\t\t\t\t\t\n</fo:block>\t\t\t\t\t\n<fo:block>Another testing data line</fo:block>\n\t\t\t\t\nThe first text 'Testing data line' can be shown just next to the each image \nsucessfully in the same page.  However, the last text 'Another testing data \nline' cannot be shown in the same page with the last image, even the last image \nis so small.  A page break is forced to appear just after the image.\n\nI have tried to use table cell for the display like this,\n<fo:table>\n  <fo:table-column column-width=\"20cm\"/>\n  <fo:table-body>\n    <xsl:for-each select=\"ADVICE/IMAGE\">\t\t\t\t        \n      <fo:table-row>\n        <fo:table-cell display-align=\"center\">\n          <fo:block text-align=\"center\">\n            <fo:external-graphic display-align=\"center\" text-align=\"center\">\n               <xsl:attribute name=\"src\"><xsl:value-of \nselect=\".\"/></xsl:attribute>\n            </fo:external-graphic>\t\n          </fo:block>\n        </fo:table-cell>\n      </fo:table-row>\n    </xsl:for-each>\n  </fo:table-body>\n</fo:table>\n\nBut the result is still the same.\n\nOn the other hand, I just put the same coding in the static content as region-\nbefore, it can be shown successfully without page break (I think it is still to \nregion-before cannot be page break).\n\nIs it the internal problem of FOP?
