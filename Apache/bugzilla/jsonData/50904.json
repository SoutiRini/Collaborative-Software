[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50904, "text": "Following the documentation for Tomcat 6 on the tomcat web site (also in webapps/docs/ in 6.0.32), I cannot configure the manager as \"manager-gui\" (this is a tc 7 feature, but listed in tc 6 docs).  \n\nStarting from a clean tomcat download, I modified manager.xml in conf/Catalina/localhost as per directions (substituting correct full path for docBase), and modified conf/tomcat-users.xml to contain\n  <role rolename=\"manager-gui\"/>\n  <user name=\"mui\" password=\"mytomcat\" roles=\"manager-gui\" />\n\nIf I try to open http://localhost:8080/manager/list, I get a 403 Access Denied error.  \n\nIf I use the previous manager configuration, e.g. \n  <role rolename=\"manager\"/>\n  <user name=\"mui\" password=\"mytomcat\" roles=\"manager\" />\n\nthen it works.  Note the webapps/manager/WEB-INF/web.xml file has \"manager-gui\" defined, but the manager-gui role doesn't seem to work.  \n\nThe only other mods I made were to create a little script called bin/runcat.sh to start tomcat using jsvc as per setup instructions, and to copy a few .war files into webapps/ to test the server, which works just fine.  Also I'm using RedHat 5 (RHEL 5.5).  I logged in as a non-privileged user (e.g. not root), and installed and ran tomcat as root.  Is running tc as root a bad idea?  \n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug in documentation, or in the manager webapp.", "id": 144881, "time": "2011-03-09T14:47:10Z", "creator": "bfetler@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-03-09T14:47:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50904, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This works.
