[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "There seems to be a problem when converting and/or resizing svg images w/ batik transcoders, which results in the drawing being clipped.  \n\nTo reproduce the problem, load the following image (http://www.croczilla.com/bits_and_pieces/svg/samples/butterfly/butterfly.svg) into the Batik SVG viewer (Squiggle).  When the Squiggle window is smaller than the image when it's loaded, you will see that even increasing window size after loading, the image is still not visible entirely.  \n\nIt seems Batik applies the hidden overflow value to all svg elements including the root one where the specification treats it differently. \n\nThe SVG specifications says:\n-------------\n\"The initial value for \u2018overflow\u2019 as defined in [CSS2-overflow] is 'visible', and this applies also to the root \u2018svg\u2019 element; however, for child elements of an SVG document, SVG's user agent style sheet overrides this initial value and sets the \u2018overflow\u2019 property on elements that establish new viewports (e.g., \u2018svg\u2019 elements), \u2018pattern\u2019 elements and \u2018marker\u2019 elements to the value 'hidden'.\" \n-------------\n\n(Removing the top level SVG clipping fixes it.)", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 50808, "id": 144424, "time": "2011-02-18T16:22:31Z", "creator": "lizet@us.ibm.com", "creation_time": "2011-02-18T16:22:31Z", "is_private": false}]
