It seems like it has neither been reported nor been fixed in the meantime.\n\nDirectories which have a ProxyPass directive configured are not listed in the index created by mod_autoindex.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a virtual server with \"DocumentRoot /test\"\n2. Enable \"Options +Indexes\" for directory /test\n3. Create directory /test/bla\n4. Set \"ProxyPass /bla http://example.com/\" for the virtual server\n5. Access the virtual server using a web browser\n\nThe directory \"bla\" will be missing from the index, even though it physically exists. Setting \"IndexOptions +ShowForbidden\" does not fix this. When removing the ProxyPass directive, the directory is shown.", "id": 186917, "time": "2015-12-13T01:47:58Z", "creator": "cdauth+bz.apache.org@cdauth.eu", "creation_time": "2015-12-13T01:47:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
