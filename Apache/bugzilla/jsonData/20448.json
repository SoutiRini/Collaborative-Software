[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20448, "text": "I installed Apache using the MSI installer located at \nhttp://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi.  Once Apache was installed, I attempted \nto view the installed documentation using Internet Explorer 6 and opening the \nindex.html file with it.  I was surprised to discover that there was no \nindex.html file, but only a language specific index.html.en file.  Of course IE \n6 refused to open the file since it did not have a .html extension.  So I then \nopened the index.html.en file with Netscape.  I was then able to view the index \npage but when I clicked on a link, it attempted to link to another HTML file \nthat did not have the .en suffix.  Since that file did not exist (the file had \na .en suffix when it should not have), the link failed with a 404 error.\n\nFrustrated, I finally gave up on viewing the installed documentation & took a \nlook at the online documentation instead.  Unfortunately this was of limited \nuse because I could not do a search thru just the installed documentation.  So \nI then attempted to do a straight text search through the installed \ndocumentation using the Windows 2000 \"Search...\" dialog...\n\nWhen I attempted to do a text search in the docs directory for PHP, I ended up \nwith a ton of hits, most of which were useless to me.  Because there are \nseveral copies of the documentation in different languages, as well as a \nboatload of XML files that it appears I don't need to view the docs, I ended up \nwith a ton of hits, most of which were on HTML documents in languages that I \ndon't know or XML files which I don't care about.  In short, the current \nshipped format of the documentation makes it impossible to do a text search for \nanything.\n\nToday a friend told me that if I viewed the documentation through the Apache \nweb server, then these problems would all mysteriously go away (less the \ninability to do a text search).  I can't tell you how frustrating it was not to \nbe able to use the documentation.  My issue with viewing the documentation over \nApache is that I want to be able to view the docs by opening the files directly \nwith a browser.  The reason for this is that I do not want to host the Apache \ndocumentation on my web server.  People that will be visiting my web site have \nno need to view the documentation, and I do not want to make it accessible to \nthem.\n\nWouldn't it be possible to either ship the documentation separately from Apache \nin language specific bundles?  Or wouldn't it be possible to put the docs for \neach language in a separate directory so that one could do a text search on \njust one copy of the docs?  Also, is it necessary to ship the XML files with a \nbinary distribution?  The Apache source isn't shipped in the binary \ninstallation, and near as I can tell, the XML files are only needed to generate \nthe documentation, and as an end-user, I really don't want to see them at all.", "id": 38259, "time": "2003-06-03T14:33:03Z", "creator": "cdearborn@secluda.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-03T14:33:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "is_private": false, "id": 38279, "creation_time": "2003-06-03T17:12:32Z", "time": "2003-06-03T17:12:32Z", "bug_id": 20448, "text": "The distributed documentation is intended to be viewed via webserver and *is*\nusable that way.\nYou may, however, download a language specific CHM file for windows, that may\nmeet  your needs better, see <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/httpd/docs/>.\n\nThe XML files are also distributed by intention, to make it easier for people to\nprovide patches etc.\n\nThanks for using Apache.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20448, "text": "It is true that the documentation is useable if hosted from the Apache web \nserver, however, as I have stated below, I do not want to host the \ndocumentation on my web server.
