As \nthe .bat file runs an ongoing process that has a user defined termination \n(closure of the window), the process process could not be terminated and so \nthe build also hung.\n\nExpected Results: .bat file executed, but from another new DOS window, which \ncan then be terminated by the user.\n\nBuild Date & Platform: Build 2005-01-17 on PC OS Windows XP SP2.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 69777, "creator": "Tom.Davies.UK@gmail.com", "time": "2005-01-17T18:18:38Z", "bug_id": 33139, "creation_time": "2005-01-17T18:18:38Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "Created attachment 14034\nopen.exe, use ShellExecuteEx() to open files\n\nTry using this app to start the batch file.
