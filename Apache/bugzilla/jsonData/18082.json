Please excuse me if this is known issue or if I am posting in a \nwrong place.\n I have compiled httpd-2.0.44 and webapp from jakarta-tomcat-connectors-4.1.18-\nsrc\nAll of compilation is fine and I think my configuration is correct too. When I \ntry to startup apache I am getting:\nSyntax error on line 1079 of /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf:\nInvalid port number (p<1) No \"Port\" statement found\n\nIn my httpd.conf I have (these are just main parts of config for this issue:\nListen 80\nServerName my.domain.com:80\nLoadModule webapp_module modules/mod_webapp.so\n\nand then for virtual host:\n\nWebAppConnection warpConnection warp localhost:8008\n\nin Virtual Host Directive:\nWebAppDeploy /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/examples warpConnection /examples\n..and like I mentioned apachectl throws error: Syntax error on line 1079 \nof /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf:\nInvalid port number (p<1) No \"Port\" statement found\n\nI belive webapp module is looking for Port statement/settings but Port \nstatement is depriciated in httpd-2.0.44 and has been replaced with Listen \nstatement. Please correct me if I am wrong or point out for any information \nregarding this. I appreciate your help.\n\n--Alex\nmsdn@spider.scorpions.net", "id": 33313, "time": "2003-03-17T22:20:22Z", "creator": "msdn@spider.scorpions.net", "creation_time": "2003-03-17T22:20:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18082, "text": "Hello guies,\n\nI got the same problem than Alex.\nI am running httpd-2.0.40-8, jakarta-tomcat-4.1.24-LE-jdk14\n with  jakarta-tomcat-connectors-4.1.24-src.\n\nThanks a lot for your fantastic job on this product !!!", "id": 34251, "time": "2003-04-01T15:39:44Z", "creator": "jlavenant@argosinc.com", "creation_time": "2003-04-01T15:39:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "text": "\"mod_webapp is deprecated and unsupported due to lack of developer interest.\nPlease use mod_jk, or jk2\"", "id": 35493, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 18082, "creation_time": "2003-04-18T13:18:47Z", "time": "2003-04-18T13:18:47Z", "is_private": false}]
