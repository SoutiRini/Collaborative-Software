The tables\nlook fine in the AWT, PDF, and PS documents but when I render the document\nusing the PCL renderer and send the PCL to the printer all of the left and\nright cell borders seem to move down and start from the the bottom of the table,\nso I have the top border, no side borders, then the bottom border with the side\nborders extending downwards.  The length of the side borders seem to be fine,\njust the positioning seem to be a problem.  Does anyone have a bug-fix or a\nsolution.\nPS. I am setting my table borders using the border-width and border-style\nattributes in the table-cell tag.\nThanks, hope someone can help - if you need more info please contact me - \namitr@hemtech.co.za", "id": 7257, "time": "2001-10-29T07:46:53Z", "creator": "amitr@hemtech.co.za", "creation_time": "2001-10-29T07:46:53Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "art_w@eastpoint.com", "text": "This should be fixed with version 1.13 of PCLRenderer.java.
