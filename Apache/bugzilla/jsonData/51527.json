I guess I did not read the documentation well enough, it already provides a millisecond representation. I usually scan-read documentation and the millisec-option is not provided in the format-list, but instead mentioned separately. I guess that is why I missed it. \n\nIn my test case, I do need an Epoch in seconds, as you mentioned. To this end, it would be useful to add another option to __time() to provide *seconds* since 1970/00/00 00:00:00, as you mentioned. In my test plan, I need to send the current time in seconds for many HTTP request. Starting the Java interpreter in order to convert millisec to second is just a waist of CPU cycles. \n\nI hope you can add it!"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51527, "is_private": false, "count": 3, "id": 162452, "time": "2012-09-28T14:02:10Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-09-28T14:02:10Z", "text": "URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1391471&view=rev\nLog:\n__time() function : add another option to __time() to provide *seconds* since epoch\nAdded /dddd division option\nBugzilla Id: 51527\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/TimeFunction.java\n    jmeter/trunk/test/src/org/apache/jmeter/functions/TestTimeFunction.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/usermanual/functions.xml"}]
