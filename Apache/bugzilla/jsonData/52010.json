[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52010, "attachment_id": null, "text": "As discussed, the layout engine tests have been changed such that rather than the build.xml injecting System properties the defaults are set. These System property dependencies haven't been removed so should a user/developer want to inject parameters they are free to do so. \n\nOther than the injecting of parameters, I've left much of the mechanism by which the layout tests run mostly the same. The only notable difference is that I've reduced a bit of the code duplication in both the build.xml and the test code. \n\nAlso, now ALL the unit tests use the \"junit-run\" macro, this is purely to minimize code duplication. However, all the ant targets remain, none of them have been removed, so functionality is exactly the same as before, but hopefully the code is a little cleaner.", "id": 150458, "time": "2011-10-11T09:44:59Z", "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-11T09:44:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "Created attachment 27757\ntests changes", "tags": [], "bug_id": 52010, "attachment_id": 27757, "count": 1, "id": 150459, "time": "2011-10-11T09:45:23Z", "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-11T09:45:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Committed.\n\nThanks again Mehdi!", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 52010, "id": 150752, "time": "2011-10-19T10:28:49Z", "creator": "peter.hancock@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-19T10:28:49Z", "attachment_id": null}]
