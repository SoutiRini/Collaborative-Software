More buck passing.  Seems pretty clear to me that if tomcat won't start as a service, and tomcat is providing the service code, then we have a bug in tomcat.  It doesn't matter to me as a user of tomcat where the source of the problem is - this bug should still be open for tracking until the source of the problem is fixed, or a workaround is put into the tomcat installer - either via the installer, or by using a new version of commons-daemon which has a workaround.  \n\nWith the bug open, maybe then this bug would attract a developer who knows c well enough to implement a workaround in commons-daemon to actually fix this problem.  Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure I know even less c than Mark, so that developer won't be me.\n\n\nI have opened a bug in commons-daemon:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DAEMON-110\n\nAnd, I'll risk wasting your time by reopening this bug - because I strongly feel that this bug shouldn't be closed until the DAEMON bug is resolved, if that is the path that is taken.  At worst, maybe the churn of reopening and closing this bug will attract another developer who has the skills necessary to actually fix this issue for the rest of the tomcat users.\n"}, {"count": 31, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41538, "attachment_id": null, "id": 118562, "creation_time": "2008-07-11T07:14:39Z", "time": "2008-07-11T07:14:39Z", "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "text": "The solution is to add %JAVA_HOME%\\jre\\bin to the system PATH environment variable reboot and then start the service.\n\nI'm closing this issues as WONTFIX, but I left the DEAMON-110 issue opened.\nSee how it will be solvable for XP SP1+ windows versions, so it wont be fixed\nfor every OS we support.\nThere is a hack to try to preload msvcrt71.dll directly, but this might not\nwork because of additional dependencies.
