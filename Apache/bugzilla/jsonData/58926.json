[{"count": 0, "text": "A group of related improvements to the apxs tool.\n\n0001: a fix to the module-name fallback search -- which I have now discovered is already submitted under PR43033. It appears to be identical to the patch submitted there, and I include it only because the later patches are based on top of it.\n\n0002: Removal of unused code that was orphaned after httpd 1.3.\n\n0003: The module name is only used when apxs is asked to activate a module (-a or -A), but apxs always errors out if it can't determine a module name. This patch only performs the search for a name if the user is trying to activate the module during installation.\n\n0004: Whitespace fixes (tabs -> 8 spaces, removal of trailing whitespace). Note that the __DATA__ portion of the code is not touched by this patch.", "bug_id": 58926, "attachment_id": null, "id": 187993, "time": "2016-01-28T00:03:04Z", "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-01-28T00:03:04Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58926, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 33497\n0001: apxs: fix module name fallback", "id": 187994, "time": "2016-01-28T00:04:33Z", "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-01-28T00:04:33Z", "attachment_id": 33497}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58926, "attachment_id": 33498, "text": "Created attachment 33498\n0002: apxs: remove Apache 1.3 code", "id": 187995, "time": "2016-01-28T00:04:56Z", "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-01-28T00:04:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "attachment_id": 33499, "is_private": false, "id": 187996, "time": "2016-01-28T00:05:26Z", "bug_id": 58926, "creation_time": "2016-01-28T00:05:26Z", "text": "Created attachment 33499\n0003: apxs: search for module names only when activating"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58926, "attachment_id": 33500, "id": 187997, "time": "2016-01-28T00:05:44Z", "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-01-28T00:05:44Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 33500\n0004: apxs: fix whitespace problems"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58926, "attachment_id": null, "id": 187998, "time": "2016-01-28T00:08:55Z", "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-01-28T00:08:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Note that each patch is based on the previous one (the Diff link appears to be based directly on trunk, so it's a little misleading).
