The FreeMind developers say this is a Batik problem.\n\nWhen exporting a PDF file from FreeMind to PDF across a LAN, it can take 20-30 \nminutes to create a 1MB PDF file.  When exporting the same FreeMind file to \nPDF on a local disk, export is almost instantaneous.\n\nFilemon from Sysinternals (http://www.sysinternals.com) reports that the PDF \nfile is being created in 1 byte increments.  For a 1MB file, that equates to \nover 1 million write requests.  Across a LAN, this many packets over such a \nshort period of time will cause a large number of collisions, requiring many \nretransmits.  The problem is worse if there is moderate network traffic on the \nLAN from other hosts.\n\nWindows XP Pro SP2\nJRE 1.5.0_12\nFreeMind 0.8.0"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43904, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 110733, "time": "2007-11-19T09:26:55Z", "creator": "andrewk8@sbcglobal.net", "creation_time": "2007-11-19T09:26:55Z", "text": "Quote from FreeMind developer:  \"for the PDF Export, we use Batik from Apache \nand don't have any influence on the time it needs.\"\n\nReported as bug # 1832631 in FreeMind."}, {"count": 2, "text": "The author of the SVG/PDF plug-in forgot to wrap the FileOutputStream with a\nBufferedOutputStream:\nhttp://freemind.cvs.sourceforge.net/freemind/freemind/plugins/svg/ExportPdf.java?view=markup\n\nBut I'll make sure that the PDF transcoder does this, too.
