[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29486, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Team,\n\nThe following patch removes the event-driven messaging between fo.FOTreeHandler \nand apps.Document (used to activate the layout of each page sequence) and \ninstead consolidates the formatPageSequence() activation into \nfo.FOTreeHandler.  In effect, the business logic to start the layout process \nfor each fo:page-sequence is consolidated from 5 classes (Driver, Document, \nFOTreeHandler, fo.FOTreeListener, fo.FOTreeEvent) back into one \n(fo.FOTreeHandler).\n\nThis change is nothing new--it is closely similar in functionality to the \nformer LayoutMgr.LayoutHandler [1], that we maintained through August of last \nyear.  (It is this class that became FOTreeHandler once this functionality was \ntaken out.)\n\n[1] http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-\nfop/src/java/org/apache/fop/layoutmgr/Attic/LayoutHandler.java?rev=1.5&view=auto\n\nWith this change, two classes will be dropped:  fo.FOTreeListener and \nfo.FOTreeEvent, two simplified (Driver and Document), and even the class \nretaining the logic (FOTreeHandler) will not be much larger, because all the \nevent messaging logic has been removed from it.  Streamlining this code will \nalso aid in better comprehension of the process, hopefully making the code less \nintimidating/more attractive for others to work with.\n\nWill apply unless too much grief over the next couple of days!\n\nThanks,\nGlen", "id": 58976, "time": "2004-06-09T23:41:53Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-09T23:41:53Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "text": "Created attachment 11807\npatch file", "id": 58977, "time": "2004-06-09T23:42:46Z", "bug_id": 29486, "creation_time": "2004-06-09T23:42:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 11807}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Applied.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 29486, "id": 59123, "time": "2004-06-11T17:21:28Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-11T17:21:28Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29486, "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 155594, "time": "2012-04-01T06:29:47Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:29:47Z", "is_private": false}]
