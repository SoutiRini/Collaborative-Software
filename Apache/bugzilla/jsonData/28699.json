[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28699, "text": "I am not sure if this is the way the software is originally designed to do, at\nleast one person is extremely annoyed by the fact, because a part of my test\nconsists of error case handling tests. In other words, I expect that a certain\nerror such as 404 (not found) comes back and I want my response assertion\nelement to match that.\n\nSteps:\n1. launch JMeter, add a thread group to the root test plan.\n2. Under the thread, add an http sampler, View Results in Table listener and\nView Results Tree listener.\n3. Under http sampler, add a response assertion.\n4. In the http sampler, add a valid web server ip address, port#, protocol used.\nThen in the path, just enter something bogus like \"doesnotexist.htm\", assuming\nthe file does not exist.\n5. In the response assertion, choose \"Response Code\" in the Response Field to\nTest. Then in the Patterns to Test table, just have a row with \"404\". Verify\nthat Pattern Matching Rule is \"Contains\".\n6. Run the test.\nResult: If you look at View Results in Table, the check box column is not\nchecked, indicating that the test was a failure. If you look at View Results\nTree and expand the tree, you'll see the HTTP Request test shown in red, further\nindicating that the test was a failure. If you look at the HTTP response code in\nthe actual result, you'll see 404.
