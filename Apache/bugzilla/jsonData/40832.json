[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "We have been using Tomcat 5.5.9 running SSL with no apparent problems, we \nrecently attempted to upgrade to Tomcat 5.5.17, however, the SSL configuration \nalthough the same as the 5.5.9, fails to run properly. A URL such as \nhttp://domain:443/page does work, however, https://domain/page does not, it \nappears to just timeout. Having reverted back (uninstalled and re-installed) to \nthe 5.5.9 version, SSL again operates correctly.  The only difference I can \nnote is that when installing the 5.5.17 version we did select the native DLL, \nwhereas, this was not available for 5.5.9. We did not try 5.5.17 without the \nnative DLL.

Can you point me to the congiguration that I \nshould be using? When you say \"native connector\" are you referring to JK or \nAPR? - The behavior of this same configuration in verion 5.5.9 is different. \nIn 5.5.9 https:// operates as one would expect, whereas in 5.5.17 it does not?\nhttps:// fails to respond, only http://domain:443 responds.\nCan you explain the difference since the setup configuration has not changed?\nThanks Bob\n\n", "id": 95566, "time": "2006-11-08T05:50:32Z", "creator": "bobd@nevo.com", "creation_time": "2006-11-08T05:50:32Z", "is_private": false}]
