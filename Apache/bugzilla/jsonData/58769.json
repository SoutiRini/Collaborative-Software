Still you can't put CustomLog |/myscript in main config since it will not catch anything if you already got CustomLog /logs/vhostXX-log in vhosts", "id": 187122, "time": "2015-12-25T01:34:41Z", "creator": "apache-bugs.a2@x25.pl", "creation_time": "2015-12-25T01:34:41Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Looking at trunk code I see that you added new GlobalLog which I suspect adresses this issue in apache 2.5 (?).
