We were pulling the\nnetwork cable to simulate catastrophic switch port failure or interface failure.\nWe were testing under load, using synchronous replication.  We found that\nexisting replication sockets would honor our timeout (ackTimeout)\nconfigurations, but new connections established because of pool growth or\nretries would not timeout socket connect attempts.
