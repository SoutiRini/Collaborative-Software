[{"count": 0, "text": "Due to Sun bug 4665037\n(http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4665037) rmi in linux may\nnot work if the name resolution is not properly configured.\n\nThe problem is that under linux the jmeter server  in rmi will be bound to ip\n127.0.0.1 instead of the real (externally reachable) ip address of the machine.\nSo although the jmeter master will be able to locate the \"JMeterEngine\"\ninstances via the RMI registry. It will not be able to connect to the actual\ninstances. \n\nActually JMeter will not complain when this happens it doesn't tell you anything\nwhen launching jmeter-server  ( not even in logs) and it will silently fail when\ntrying to start the remote instances (no trace in the logs). \n\nIt's very easy to include a check in RemoteJMeterEngineImpl.java to check\nInetAddress.getLocalHost().isLoopbackAddress() and raise an exception or at\nleast log it. \n\n\nAlso it would be very convenient to add log statements in the catch\njava.rmi.xxxxException blocks in the ClientJMeterEngine.java. \n\n\n} catch (java.rmi.ConnectException e) {\n  log.error(\"rmi exception\", e);\n\nbecause otherwise this kind of failures go unnoticed.", "bug_id": 41028, "is_private": false, "id": 96122, "time": "2006-11-23T07:27:03Z", "creator": "ruben.laguna@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-11-23T07:27:03Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41028, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 19207\nPath to detect if the system is trying to register a loopback address to the rmi registry\n\nThis patch detects if the the address we are binding to the rmiregistry is a\nloopback address and throws an exception if this is the case.", "id": 96389, "time": "2006-11-29T23:48:41Z", "creator": "ruben.laguna@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-11-29T23:48:41Z", "attachment_id": 19207}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41028, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 111789, "time": "2007-12-13T16:31:34Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-12-13T16:31:34Z", "text": "Thanks for the patch.\n\nImplemented in SVN r604072."}]
