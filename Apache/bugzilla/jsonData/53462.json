For instance if a user accesses /me@vt.edu/test/ then I would like to serve the content of file /me@vt.edu/test (if it exists).\n\nLegimitate request?\n\nI'm using this rule:\n\nRewriteRule ^(.*@.*/.+)/$ $1\n\nin an attempt to strip the trailing slash.\n\nmod_rewrite says in its log:\n\napplying pattern '^(.*@.*/.+)/$' to uri 'me@vt.edu/test/'\nrewrite 'me@vt.edu/test/' -> 'me@vt.edu/test'\ninitial URL equal rewritten URL: /myserverpath/me@vt.edu/test [IGNORING REWRITE]\n\nNo! The initial URL was me@vt.edu/test/ and it's NOT equal to the rewritten URL.\n\nInterestingly, if I use a redirect, as in\n\nRewriteRule ^(.*@.*/.+)/$ $1 [R]\n\nit works, but of course is very inefficient (and does not work with clients that don't automatically follow redirects!)\n\nI think this should work, hence file this as a bug.  Thanks."}]
