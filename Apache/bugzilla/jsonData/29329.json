It requires such convoluted logic, \nthat a few simple if else then constructs become a huge mess which requires you \nto create \"fake\" targets (since that is the only tag that supports conditional \nexecution) to set properties.  What should have been a half page of simple \nlogic has become two pages of hacks to set various properties in \"fake\" targets \nin order to get ant to do what I want.\n\nThere has to be a better solution than what currently exists.\nI would eagerly sacrafice backwards compatibility in order to get better \ncondition constructs.  Having <antcall> support conditionals, and improving the \nexisting \"if\" syntax to checking more than if a property has been defined would \nbe huge improvements.\n\nFor example <target ...    if=\"project == 'my_project' and exists ${src_dir}\"/>\n\nThat's my request.\nAnyway, thanks again for making an otherwise great tool.", "id": 58481, "time": "2004-06-01T18:33:25Z", "creator": "jwenners@incsystem.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-01T18:33:25Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 29329, "is_private": false, "id": 58487, "time": "2004-06-01T18:47:23Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-06-01T18:47:23Z", "tags": [], "text": "All you have to do is incorporate ant-contrib's <if> and possibly other tasks..."}]
