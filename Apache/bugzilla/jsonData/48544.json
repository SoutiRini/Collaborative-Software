The class is here:\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/xssf/eventusermodel/XLSX2CSV.java\n\nI recently found a bug in an embedded class, ReadonlySharedStringsTable, that is triggered by a workbook that contains only numbers and therefore has no shared strings table.  I've attached a small patch that revises the constructor to check that the ArrayList of package parts is not empty before grabbing the first item.
