This is not related to bug 43616. I strongly\nsuspect that this is due to the fact that collapsed borders are not considered\nto lie half in the before and after margin for tables which are inside another\ntable. You can circumvent the problem by specifying border-collapse=\"separate\"\non the inner tables. You will have to rework your border specifications a bit,\nbut you should still be able to achieve the layout you need. Please ask on\nfop-users if you need more explanations.\n\nDetails: the merging algorithm seems to forget that the border-before/after on a\ntable with collapsing borders lie half in the margin. Thus the total size of the\nmerged sequence is bigger than expected, and overflows the page size. Whereas\nwhen adding the areas, borders are actually put half in the margins, so that on\nthe visual results it looks like there is still room for the last 2 lines."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43712, "is_private": false, "id": 111130, "creation_time": "2007-11-27T03:17:50Z", "time": "2007-11-27T03:17:50Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "text": "My bad, the problem was totally unrelated...\n\nborder-collapse is an inheritable property, so if it is set to \"separate\" on an\nouter table it will also be set to \"separate\" on inner tables. I've checked and\nit works properly.\n\nThe problem here was due to a bug that I fixed in revision 596727: the height of\nsome elements was counted twice, once in a glue and once in a box.
