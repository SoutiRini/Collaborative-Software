[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "mike@ds808.net", "text": "I tried the tomcat 3.2 security example using basic authentication with tomcat \n4 standalone.  It works fine.  As soon as I use the tomcat 4 ajp13 connector \nwith iis5, it does not work.  Where I expect the logon form to appear, it \nsimply just goes directly to a tomcat 4.2.b1 http status 403 - access to the \nrequested resource has been denied screen.  I expected tomcat to respond with a \nStatus: 401 unauthorized and a WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"xxxx\" response.  \nI even tried it with the /manager webapp with the same results.  I even tried \nit with form base authentication with same results.
