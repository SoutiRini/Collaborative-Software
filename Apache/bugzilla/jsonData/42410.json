[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "At my job I wrote an ant task which I believe can be extremely useful to put\ninto ant... This task does the following:\nTake a file \"target file\" and replace a token in that target file with the token\nitself, a newline, and entire contents of a \"source file\".\n\nThis is specifically written to work with XML and not a flat file, but the task\nwould create some comment markers so that the changes can be undone (by\nspecifying the \"source file\" and the markers will provide info on what needs to\nbe deleted). The goal was also to ensure that more than 1 run would not create\nduplicate code in the \"target file\", as well as the ability to undo the changes.\n\nThe idea is for doing things like: Modifying web.xml to inject it with new\ninformation (lets say we modify some client's install) by injecting web.xml with\n some other file which contains a list of custom servlet mappings.\n\nIn any case, I thought I would put the idea out there, if you guys like it I can\nsend you what I have, it needs some work to make it a completely generic\nant-task but it seems like a nice thing to have. I do not know how many people\nneed this sort of functionality. Maybe this is more inline with the ant-contrib\nlibrary?\n\n--Dmitriy", "is_private": false, "id": 103187, "creation_time": "2007-05-14T09:06:13Z", "time": "2007-05-14T09:06:13Z", "creator": "dlikhten@gmail.com", "bug_id": 42410, "attachment_id": null}]
