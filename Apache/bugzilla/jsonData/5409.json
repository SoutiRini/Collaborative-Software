[{"count": 0, "text": "Hi,\nTC generates quite a few log files and I think it's a good\nidea to have TC remove these files automatically. Some of us\nonly look at log files if there are problems.

Perhaps there should\nbe a parameter named something like 'maxLogFileAge' and with\na value of '5' and that all log files older than 5 days are\nremoved.\n\nThanks", "bug_id": 5409, "is_private": false, "id": 8892, "time": "2001-12-13T06:49:17Z", "creator": "lpv@texas.net", "creation_time": "2001-12-13T06:49:17Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "craig.mcclanahan@sun.com", "is_private": false, "id": 8939, "creation_time": "2001-12-14T18:34:09Z", "time": "2001-12-14T18:34:09Z", "bug_id": 5409, "text": "This kind of task is what operating system facilities like \"cron\" (in Unix) or\nthe task scheduler (in Windows) are for.
