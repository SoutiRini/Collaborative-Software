To do the deployment the server needs to be restarted.  \nI know the properties are correctly set as they work when I put them in the\ntomcat_server/conf/context.xml file.\nIs there a way we can set the resources globally + using hot deployment?\n\n\nSolution 1 and 2: Works but are not useful for a production environment.\n\n1) When putting the resources in the tomcat_server/conf/context.xml, hot\ndeployment will work.  The drawback is that there can only be 1 context be\ndefined for the Tomcat server.  This means that we can only run 1 application on\n1 Tomcat server. This option I cannot use as I need to be able to several\napplications on 1 Tomcat server.\n\n2) When putting the resources in the META-INF/context.xml directory of the web\napplication.  This solution works properly.  This implies that we need to build\na new war file for each environment.  But our company policy is that we need to\nbe able to deploy the same war file on different environments.\n\t\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nGuy", "id": 104588, "time": "2007-06-20T23:38:35Z", "creator": "gvsg_immo@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2007-06-20T23:38:35Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42712, "is_private": false, "id": 105162, "time": "2007-07-06T18:42:29Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-07-06T18:42:29Z", "tags": [], "text": "Bugzilla is not support forum.
