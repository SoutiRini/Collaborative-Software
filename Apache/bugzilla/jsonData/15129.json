[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15129, "text": "Dreamweaver version: Dreamweaver Ultradev 4\nTomcat Version: Tomcat 4.1, using default port 8080\n\nFolowing the instructions given in the documentation for this component, I \ndownloaded all appropriate applications, placed the CTLX WAR files in the \nTomcat directory (including ultradev4-tutorial.war and TLDParser.war), and set \nall the necessary environment variables on my machine. I also ran the \nextension ctlx.mxp in order to place the extension in Dreamweaver.\n\nOver the course of testing the CTLX, I discovered the following inadequacies \nin the distribution:\n\n1: Tomcat is unable to run http://localhost:8080/ultradev4-tutorial/ctl-\nmessage.jsp. It returns an error 404. After some work, I discovered that the \nreason for its failure is that the web.xml file has the following tag library \nreference:\n\n  <taglib>\n    <taglib-uri>/WEB-INF/app.tld</taglib-uri>\n    <taglib-location>/WEB-INF/app.tld</taglib-location>\n  </taglib>\n\nThe app.tld file is not included in the ultradev4-tutorial.war file (and \nconsequently not in the application when Tomcat runs), so Tomcat fails to \naccess the application. The only way to get around this problem is to \neliminate the taglib reference.\n\n2: The web.xml file for the ultradev4-tutorial application also contains \ntaglib references to several standard struts tld files that are also missing \nfrom ultradev4-tutorial.war. In order for the application to work properly in \nTomcat, these files must be included in the WEB-INF directory, or the taglib \nreferences must be removed.\n\n3: The tutorial instructs us to Copy the struts.tld, struts-bean.tld and \nstruts-logic.tld files from TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ultradev4-tutorial/WEB-INF/ to\nTOMCAT_HOME/webapps/TLDParser/tlds\". After doing this, restarting Tomcat, and \nfollowing the instructions for creating a \"site\" in Ultradev, I attempted to \naccess the tag libraries as instructed in the tutorial:\n\n\"Open the extension's 'Use a Custom Tag Library' floater by selecting \nWindow|Use Custom Tags.\"\n\nUnfortunately, no tag libraries appear in the Custom Tag Library floater. \nInstead there is a great deal of HTML indicating that an error occurred. The \ndocumentation suggests that the floater behaves in this way when required \njavabeans are missing from the custom tag. According to the documentation:\n\n\"Many custom tag libraries include tags that require the presence of beans or \nvariables to compile correctly. If one of these requirements is not met, the \nserver will return an error message that will be displayed in Live Data Mode. \nTo avoid such errors, make sure the all necessary beans are deployed on the \nserver, and all necessary variables have been set before enabling Live Data \nMode\"\n\nUpon checking all \"variables\", I was able to determine that they were properly \nset. Furthermore, since I was only using the struts tag libraries, I made sure \nthat the ultradev4-tutorial application had the struts.jar file in its \nlibrary. I used no other tag libraries; consequently I required no other \nJavabeans for the application. Apparently, something required is missing from \nthe distribution that is required in order to allow Dreamweaver to properly \naccess the Struts tag libraries.\n\nObviously, for the reasons given above, the Ultradev 4 CTLX is completely \nunusable as it is currently being distributed. Someone please fix the \ninadequacies described in this report -- and please test it in order to make \nsure that it has everything that it needs so that someone running the tutorial \ncan actually do what the instructions say???\n\nThank you.", "id": 27482, "time": "2002-12-06T00:59:52Z", "creator": "rbrown@CeltCorp.com", "creation_time": "2002-12-06T00:59:52Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15129, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Resolving.
