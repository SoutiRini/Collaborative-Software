The requirement at our end is to log all the \u201cjava.util.logging\u201d related logging messages to custom log files using log4j.xml.\n\nI see \u201cjul-log4j-bridge\u201d can be used to achieve this requirement from the URL http://people.apache.org/~psmith/logging.apache.org/sandbox/jul-log4j-bridge/intro.html. However the URL also mentioned that \u201cThis library will not work with log4j 1.2.14 or earlier\u201d.\n\nCould you please let me know the way to configure these \u201cjava.util.logging\u201d related log messages to custom log files using log4j.xml (version 1.2.11). \n\nThanks in advance. \n\nRegards, \nReshmi"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 160694, "time": "2012-07-17T16:04:51Z", "bug_id": 53557, "creation_time": "2012-07-17T16:04:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "If you are able to add a new library (jul-log4j-bridge.jar) to your project, why are you not able to upgrade your current version of Log4j to the latest (or at least 1.2.14) as required by the jul-log4j-bridge library?\n\nThe requirement is not arbitrary.  Your only option (other than modifying source code yourself) is to upgrade Log4j to comply with the requirement."}]
