Not sure where they'd get that idea from).\n\nAll of THAT aside, so little code is changed, and it's mostle just shuffling \nheader includes, I'd question if the patch was even copyrightable in the first \nplace.\n\nWe've submitted many patches upstream in the past, and will continue to do so \nin the future.  If this one slipped through the cracks, it's only because it \nwas so small and insignificant, not because of the license.  By all means, \ntake it, give it a new home in ASF SVN, let us stop carrying it around in our \npackage.\n\n...
