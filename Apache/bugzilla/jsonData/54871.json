Default is true\"\n\nFrom line 53:\n\nprivate boolean includeCellComments = false;\n\n\nClearly, the default is in fact false.  This could easily cause some poor developer to spend a great deal of time pulling out their hair, saying very unkind things to their monitors, and wondering why on earth the cell comments are not being extracted.\n\nI have attached a patch file to fix the issue.  There was a choice between changing the default behaviour and changing the javadoc to match the default behaviour.  I have opted for the latter as it's less likely to break code which is already working and because it matches the behaviour of the ExcelExtractor.", "id": 166734, "time": "2013-04-19T22:35:10Z", "bug_id": 54871, "creation_time": "2013-04-19T22:35:10Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54871, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks, fixed in r1496510, will go live next time the site is published.", "id": 168040, "time": "2013-06-25T15:05:46Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2013-06-25T15:05:46Z", "is_private": false}]
