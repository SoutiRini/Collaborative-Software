But in the new version of JSF, which is JSF 1.2.9 from\nJuly/17/2008, init() is not called.\n\nI wrote a bug against JSF, and they said that I should write a bug against Tomcat 6, and mention the DefaultAnnotationProcessor.  So this is the bug.\n\nThe URL of my JSF bug is\n\nhttps://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=800", "bug_id": 45869, "attachment_id": null, "id": 120900, "time": "2008-09-23T17:50:07Z", "creator": "removeps-code@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-23T17:50:07Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 45285 ***", "bug_id": 45869, "attachment_id": null, "id": 120912, "time": "2008-09-24T05:18:40Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-09-24T05:18:40Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
