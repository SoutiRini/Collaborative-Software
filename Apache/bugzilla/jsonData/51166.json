I have that problem too.\n\nI completely converted my web site to html from php to work around this problem, and now I can get 64 clients, using worker.c but no more.\n\nI looked into the source a little.\n\nIt seems that the worker_pre_config in worker.c is erroneously setting\nmax clients to 10 for some reason having to do with whether\nThreadsPerChild has been set.\n\nThen when set_max_clients runs, MaxClients is set to 64 instead of 3\ntimes 64 where I want it to be.  This is causing my site to loose traffic.  I have been trying to resolve this problem since about the 20th of last month.\n\nI have attached my httpd.conf\n\nThanks,\n\nMarion McCoskey"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51166, "text": "Where's the error log, httpd -V,  and some sign this config file attached is use, and that your MaxClients isn't 192?\n\nWhat's in conf.d/*.conf?", "id": 146182, "time": "2011-05-07T11:48:40Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-05-07T11:48:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "mckyyy@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "There was a .conf file in conf.d that was causing the problem.
