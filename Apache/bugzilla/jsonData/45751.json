After I started it up, I sent a request to it.(You can see the request in the attachment, its name is \"1.txt\"). Everytime, I got the same strange response.There are three strange codes(\"211a \" , \"5c\" and \"0\") in the response. You can see the response in the attachment. Its name is ouptut.txt.\n\nI have to clarify that the server I started up and the client were on the same computer. I wrote a java program (compiled on JDK: 1.6.0_04) to send the request. You can see it in the attachment. Its name is \"SendRequest3.java\". If you want to repeat my experiment, you should do the following steps:\n\n1) start up the server (in one Terminal): \"./httpd\"\n2) compile \"SendRequest3.java\"\n3\uff09run the test case (in another Terminal while on the same computer that the server is running on): \"java SendRequest3 1\" . The \"SendRequest3.class\" and \"1.txt\" should be in the same folder.\n\nCould you investigate the reason for those strange codes in the response from the server ? I am debugging it but I have not found the real reason for it.\n\nMy email address is wangwenhua06@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": 22529, "bug_id": 45751, "id": 120398, "time": "2008-09-05T08:19:17Z", "creator": "wangwenhua06@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-05T08:19:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45751, "attachment_id": null, "id": 120399, "time": "2008-09-05T08:22:30Z", "creator": "wangwenhua06@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-09-05T08:22:30Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Maybe, this bug is a security bug.
