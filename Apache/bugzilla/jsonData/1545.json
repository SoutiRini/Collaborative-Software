Having global filters was anoying as it reduced teh ability to be \nselective. So I made the filters behave more like patternsets/filesets.\nAlthough not sure about the reference stuff. (its coming)\n\nSo first I created a new FilterSet date type.\nI moved all the filtering functinality from Project and Filter into the \nFilterSet class. \n\nFilterSet elemets take attrbiutes begintoken and endtoken to give flexibility \nfor filter matcheing rather than just @foobar@.\n\nIt also takes nested elements filter elements that have the same for as the \nold filter task. Plus added a filtersfile element that takes a file attribute \nbeing a file name.\n\nI made the Filter task use the filterset but set globally in Project.\n\nI then modified copy to use the filtersets rather than the global filters on \nProject.\n\nI added filterset functionality to the SqlExec task. For useing plsql etc ie \ncan substitute &amp;foobar. \n\nI like to copy sources before compiling for reasons I dont wish to detail to \nallowed the substitution of the output from a compiler so I could substitute \nthe beginning of file paths with the repos root instead (so it ide's you dont \nend up editing the copy :)\n\nHope this clears it up a little. All of this is in the doc patches that are \nincluded in the patch.\n\nMichael"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1545, "attachment_id": null, "id": 2423, "time": "2001-05-13T17:04:05Z", "creator": "elod@itfais.com", "creation_time": "2001-05-13T17:04:05Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Should add the ability to conditionally load a filtersfile -- if the the file \ndoesn't exist, then it shouldn't fail the build only perhaps logging a \nwarning message.\n"}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1545, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 4272, "time": "2001-08-04T08:03:24Z", "creator": "conor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-08-04T08:03:24Z", "text": "I have committed the basic filterset stuff with some major changes: Reference \nsupport, multiple filtersets in copy, better backward compatability for the \nchanges in Project, extraction of FileUtils, etc.\n\nI have not implemented the SQL and Javac changes as I wanted to concentrate on \nthe basic functionality first and then look at those separately.
