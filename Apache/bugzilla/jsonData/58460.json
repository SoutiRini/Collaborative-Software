This cannot be converted back to an Excel Date as the year is now less than 1900.\n\nIn such a case, the comparison excelDate == DateUtil.getExcelDate(DateUtil.getJavaDate(excelDate,false)) also fails.\n\nIt is not immediately apparent that excel dates in the interval [0, 1) do not have an equivalent Date value in Java. A naive user might expect such a value to be converted to 1900-01-01 xx:xx:xx instead of 1989-12-31 xx:xx:xx.\n\nPlease document this behaviour in the getDateCellValue() method and in the DateUtil class."}]
