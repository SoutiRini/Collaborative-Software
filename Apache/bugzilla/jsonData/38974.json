Apache is setup as a reverse proxy and only accepts HTTPS traffic\n2. Tomcat is used as the backend server and the communication between Apache \nand Tomcat is over plain HTTP (no HTTPS).\n\nThe actions are:\n\n1. The client sends a multipart POST request.\n2. Apache forwards the request to the Tomcat server. Using ethereal we found \nthat in the forwarded message the first part of the multipart message is gone!\n\nNotes:\n\n1. When accessing Apache over HTTP instead of HTTPS the multipart message is \nforwared correctly: no parts are lost.\n2. Using Apache 2.0.54 instead of 2.0.55 this problem does not occur.", "id": 86831, "time": "2006-03-15T08:26:21Z", "creator": "arjan.schaaf@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-03-15T08:26:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38974, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 37145 ***", "id": 86833, "time": "2006-03-15T09:09:48Z", "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-03-15T09:09:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
