[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The base functionality of mod_vhost_alias for dynamic mass virtual hosting seems to work great, but \nthere are a couple things that need to be changed to work with it.\n\nFirst, I would like www.domain.com and domain.com to work off of the same directory. An easy way \nwould be to have ServerAlias work with the %0, %1, etc variables. The same thing with logging. It would \nbe nice to be able to to use %0 in specifying the path to the log ot the log name.\n\nIn the end I would like to be able to do something like this:\n\nUseCanonicalName Off\nLogFormat \"%V %h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %s %b\" vcommon\nCustomLog /web/hosts/%0/access_log vcommon\nVirtualDocumentRoot /web/hosts/%0/htdocs\nVirtualScriptAlias /web/hosts/%0/cgi-bin\nServerAlias www.%0\n\nThe weird thing is RewriteRules don't seem to work either.
