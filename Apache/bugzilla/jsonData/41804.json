The only\nindication they are viewing a revision is the URL. This isn't enough difference.\nA previous version of the trunk threw an exception when trying to publish a\nrevision. I know this because I saw a very experienced user make the mistake.\nThis has been fixed, but it does show that something different needs to be done\nto indicate it is a previous revision and can only be viewed.\n\nMaybe getting rid of the menu entirely would work."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "andreas@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 100574, "time": "2007-03-19T03:18:28Z", "bug_id": 41804, "creation_time": "2007-03-19T03:18:28Z", "tags": [], "text": "The menubar is now hidden when viewing a revision.\nThanks for reporting!"}]
