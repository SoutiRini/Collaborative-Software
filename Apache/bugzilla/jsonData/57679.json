This roll over then affects the values in the other fields that are calculated based on running time and the # of samples (average, throughput, KB/sec, etc).\n\nThis roll over happened during a 3 day test (over a weekend) when the throughput was roughly 35,000 connections a second.  It looks as though the # Samples field is kept as a 32-bit number.  Could this be increased to a 64-bit number so that longer tests could be run without fear of the averages becoming inaccurate?"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 57679, "is_private": false, "id": 181614, "time": "2015-03-09T21:01:27Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2015-03-09T21:01:27Z", "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\nThanks for report.\nNice to know you reach 35000 connections per second !\nI would be very interested to know a bit more about your use case if possible.\n\nRegarding the bug, we are currently in release process of 2.13 which should be out soon, so we will try to handle this one in next release.\n\nRegards"}]
