Some minor comments.\n\n1. Reuse of the error message jsp.error.taglib.reserved.prefix is confusing,\nsince we are not dealing with taglib here.  Better to use a new message.\n\n2. I am not sure it's necessary to check again the list of reserved prefixes.  I\nthink spec says some prefixes are not to be used for custom tags, which requires\na <%@ taglib  declaration, it doesn't say if you can use it in a template text. \nYour fix may be controversial.  I think it sufficient to just check for <jsp:\nfor now.  I am not 100% sure about this though.\n\n3. The message contains the string <jsp:, which will be \"eaten\" when displayed. \nYou should URL encode \"<\".
