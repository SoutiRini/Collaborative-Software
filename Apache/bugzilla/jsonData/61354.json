PJ, thank you for fixing this so quickly!\n\nAs a side note, Tika's experimental SAX parser for docx does extract everything; and this is exactly one of the reasons that I added it -- so that if we don't account for structural rareties(?), we'll still get the text.  With our DOM model, we're looking for some specific things in specific places (see also TIKA-1130).\n\nMake no mistake, we need to fix our DOM parser when people find problems, and I'm grateful that you opened this!"}]
