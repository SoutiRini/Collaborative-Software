If, in fact, no\ncookies are used, then it is likely doing URL-Rewriting.  However, I would bet\nyour application is, in fact, storing a cookie on the browser.  Please use the\nJMeter mailing list to ask questions about how to use JMeter rather than the bug\ndatabase.\n", "id": 77307, "time": "2005-07-14T20:00:12Z", "bug_id": 35744, "creation_time": "2005-07-14T20:00:12Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
