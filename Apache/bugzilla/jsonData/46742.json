[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "josh@apache.org", "text": "The set of adjustments that potentially need to be done by shiftRows() is very large.  Currently, POI's implementation covers the most commonly needed adjustments, but is nonetheless incomplete.\n\nThis bugzilla has been created to outline the functionality still missing from shiftRows(). As I understand, here is the full list of potential adjustments:\n\n - Cell Values\n - Cell Formats (+row heights etc)\n - Merged Cells\n - Cell Comments\n - Print Areas\n - Active/selected cells\n - Page Breaks\n - Row Groupings (needed?)\n - Formulas\n    - Cell formulas\n    - Defined names\n    - Conditional formats\n    - Data validations\n    - VB/Form object formula properties e.g. EmbeddedObjectRefSubRecord.field_2_refPtg\n\nDoes anyone have anything to add/remove to this list?\n\n\nNext, POI's current behaviour should be determined.  From what I understand, HSSF has slightly better coverage. XSSF does not adjust comments, page breaks or conditional formats. Neither HSSF nor XSSF adjust print areas, active/selected cells, row groupings, defined names, data validations, VB/form object formula properties.\nIt would probably be a good idea to update the javadoc to reflect our understanding.\n\nThe remaining functionality needs to be prioritised.  I would suggest the following (according to perceived usefulness):\n\n - Defined names\n - Conditional formats\n - Data validations\n - Print Areas\n - Page Breaks\n - Cell Comments\n - Row Groupings\n - VB/Form object formula properties\n - Active/selected cells\n\nFuture enhancement requests may bump the priorities.  Some items may get done out of order due to relative ease.\n\nThis record may remain open for a long time, hence the severity and priority have been set low.  Work on any one of these items probably should be tracked in separate bugzilla records which can be referenced here.", "id": 125008, "time": "2009-02-19T19:36:12Z", "bug_id": 46742, "creation_time": "2009-02-19T19:36:12Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46742, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I would add these (in priority order):\n\n - Repeating rows and columns (workbook.setRepeatingRowsAndColumns )\n - Hyperlinks attached to cells\n - Anchors of drawings (needed?)\n   - pictures and shapes anchored to cells\n   - drop-down lists with the data set as cell area reference\n - pivot areas ( we should at least check that shiftRows doesn't break .xls with pivot areas)\n - Excel charts (I'm not sure what this involves)\n\nshiftRows is getting complicated. It includes more functionality than a single method can fit. It may be worth putting the logic in a class and use in HSSF-XSSF, or make this class abstract and have HSSF and XSSF implement a method per each operation. \n\nAll common functionality should be tested in terms of common org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.* interfaces. This should be true for common HSSF-XSSF tests in general, not only for shiftRows. There is an attempt to do that in org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.BaseTestSheetShiftRows and I expect that we will follow this approach.\n\nAs to priorities, I agree that the highest one is Defined names. Without it shiftRows does not guarantee the consistence of sheet formulas. The other items can be shuffled. \nXSSF does not yet support Conditional formats and Data validations and I doubt it will be included in 3.5-final. Also, XSSF does not yet process VB/Form formulas. \n\nMy adjusted list:\n\n - Defined names (XSSF and HSSF)\n - Conditional formats (HSSF)\n - Data validations (HSSF)\n - Print Areas (XSSF and HSSF)\n - Repeated Rows / Columns (XSSF and HSSF)\n - Page Breaks (XSSF and HSSF)\n - Cell Comments (XSSF and HSSF)\n - Hyperlinks (XSSF and HSSF)\n - Row Groupings (XSSF and HSSF)\n - VB/Form object formula properties (HSSF)\n - Active/selected cells (XSSF and HSSF)\n\nYegor", "id": 125013, "time": "2009-02-19T23:44:53Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2009-02-19T23:44:53Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "text": "I added support for shifting named ranges both for HSSF and XSSF.
