These referenced other JARs are not required for the application and thus are not stored on the server.\n\nWhen tomcat is started method \"processManifest\" of class \"org.apache.tomcat.util.scan.StandardJarScanner\" tries to resolve that class-path entry and you end up with lots of errors in the log.\n\nUnfortunatelly you are not able to use the \"jarsToSkip\" and \"<JarScanFilter>\" config params since this JAR actually contains one or more TLDs which should be scanned.\n\n\n\nSuggested \"Improvement\":\n\nProvide a switch for not processing the class-path entry of manifest files.
