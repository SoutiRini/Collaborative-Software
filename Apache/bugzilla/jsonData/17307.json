On win2000 SP3, I have not had any blue screens, except what I have \nsaid in bug#17055(only relevant to SSL).\n\nClearly, if the win32 version of Apache 2.0.44 had blues screens of death and \nwas broken, everyone would be posting about it.\n\nFormat your system, re-install win2k and IE with all relevant patches.  Then re-\ninstall Apache2.0.44.  That is your solution."}]
