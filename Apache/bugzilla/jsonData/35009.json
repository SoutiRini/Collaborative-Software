Jalopy \n(http://jalopy.sourceforge.net) reformats code to adhere to a specified code layout.  Both have been \nused manually in earlier log4j development and had configuration files in the CVS.  This bug adds \ntargets to the build.xml files to support invoking the tools.  In addition, the Jalopy and Checkstyle \nconfiguration files were inconsistent in the treatment of whitespace within array initializers which is \nalso addressed.\n\nBoth Checkstyle and Jalopy require entries in build.properties to locate their implementations, see \nbuild.properties.sample for examples.\n\nTo invoke checkstyle (all files, specified files):\n\nant checkstyle \nant checkstyle -Dcheckstyle.files=org/apache/log4j/pattern/\\*.java\n\nTo invoke Jalopy\n\nant jalopy -Djalopy.files=org/apache/log4j/pattern/\\*.java"}]
