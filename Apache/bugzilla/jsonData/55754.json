Formulas which are using these number cells can't run.\nWith XLS, i don't have any problem.\nThe cell format defined with Excel is a numeric with 4 decimals.\n\nIn source code of POI (i use 3.10 beta 2):\nXSSFCell.setCellValue(double value){\n...\n_cell.setV(String.valueOf(value));\n...\n}\n\nFor example, with value=1.0015 => String.valueOf(value) = \"1.0015\"\n\n\nIn any case, my source code:\n\ndouble value = Double.parseDouble(\"1.0015\");\ncell.setCellValue(value); //xls => OK (cell completed with : 1,0015 ) , xlsm => KO (cell completed with : 1.0015)\n\nIs there a bug?\nWhy with XLS Files, i don't have problem?\n\nThanks.\nDoD"}]
