[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nPerhaps someone can provide some advice on this annoying problem.  \n\nUsing SSI variables, I create a variable.  Sometimes this string will have a French accent in the word.\n\nI pass this variable to a  simple PERL script.  It works fine if it is in English or any other character other than a letter containing a diacritic.  I have tried using $Agrave; etc.  and nothing works.\n\nIf I manually enter the string value with a french accent into my perl script it works fine.\n\nThis is my problem:\n\n--define my variable on one page-- \n<!--#set var=\"link1\" value=\"\u00e9l\u00e8ve\" -->\n\n\nSend it to my perl page:\n\n\n$link1 = $ENV{'link1'};\n\nprint \"Content-type:text/html\\n\\n\";    \n\n\nif ($link1 ne \"\") \n{ \nprint \"$link1\"; \n}\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.", "is_private": false, "id": 122926, "creator": "ngb1955@gmail.com", "time": "2008-11-29T07:07:08Z", "bug_id": 46311, "creation_time": "2008-11-29T07:07:08Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "text": "What happens when it doesn't work?
