You clearly know what you are doing so feel free to use it :)\n\nA couple of things to note although I suspect you know all this already anyway:\n- commits should normally be made to trunk and then backported (trunk -> 7.0.x -> 6.0.x) as appropriate\n- trunk and 7.0.x are CTR but 6.0.x is RTC so proposals need to be added to the status file for 6.0.x\n- the trunk changelog entries are currently limited to those changes that won't be back-ported\n- the changelogs have a comment at the top that explain the order of entries\n\nHave fun!", "id": 168577, "time": "2013-07-13T09:43:54Z", "bug_id": 55259, "creation_time": "2013-07-13T09:43:54Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55259, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 168632, "time": "2013-07-17T01:45:57Z", "creator": "jboynes@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-07-17T01:45:57Z", "text": "Fixed in trunk: http://svn.apache.org/r1502897"}]
