The application communicates via http Hessian protocol (a binary data stream over http).\n\nprotocol: http binary content; Content-Type: x-application/hessian\n\nTest-Setup:\n- java application (app) with proxy setting: port 8888 \n- JMeter started with proxy setting: port 9000\n- Fiddler started with sniffing at port 9000\n- JMeter recorder with port = 8888\n\nsteps:\n1. start Fiddler\n2. start JMeter with proxy settings and prepare workbench with recorder setting: port = 8888\n3. start application \n4. take an action \"A\"\n5. play recorded request (without saving the project)\n6. compare the post data of http-requests of step 4 and 5 with Fiddler\n\nactual result:\n- there are additional Bytes when JMeter plays the request\n- especially: 0x0D is inserted before 0x0A\n  i.a.: recorded part: 0x93, 0x0A, 0x6D\n        played part  : 0x93, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x6D\n  i.a.: recorded part: 0x64, 0x0A, 0x6D\n        played part  : 0x64, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x6D\n  i.a.: recorded part: 0x6E, 0x0A, 0x70\n        played part  : 0x6E, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x70\n\n  \nexpected result:\n- there is no modification of the binary stream\n\nIt seems that there is a difference between recording and replay of recorded data. With that behaviour (post data modification) I can't use JMeter and I have to look for other tools.\n\nRegards,\nNiko\nPS: I can't attach files, because I use it at as a proof of concept at customer side.\n--------------------------------\n\nJMeter: Version 3.0 r1743807\nJava: java.version=1.8.0_101\njava.vm.name=Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM\nos: Microsoft Windows 10\nos.arch=amd64\nos.version: 10.0.14393\n-------------------------------", "id": 195254, "time": "2016-11-27T21:38:49Z", "creator": "nminfo55-jmeter@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2016-11-27T21:38:49Z", "is_private": false}]
