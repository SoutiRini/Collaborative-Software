I think that this is not entirely correct, because \"even\" only forces an even number of pages inside the current page-sequence, but not for the whole document. Since lastPageNum refers to the total amount of pages, the mod check should be done like that:\n\n(lastPageNum - startPageNum + 1) % 2 != 0\n\nThe same applies to \"odd\" and \"end-on-odd\".\n\nCould you please check that?\n\nThanks\nMatthias"}]
