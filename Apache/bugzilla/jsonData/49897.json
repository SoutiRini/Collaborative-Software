I'm also working in an OSGi environment. I suggest that we work towards removing any W3C DOM sources from Batik and instead cooperate with the Xerces team who maintains xml-apis and xml-apis-ext. I've done these things to my local Batik working copy but right now I don't remember which steps I took exactly. I'll need to find time to replicate that and propose a concrete changes to Batik.\n\nA little background concerning OSGi: Every OSGi bundle (JAR plus manifest metadata) declares exactly which Java packages it imports and which it exports. The OSGi framework then does the wiring of the packages based on version information in a network of class loaders rather than the hierarchical class loader used by normal Java applications. Therefore, problems arise as soon as two JARs provide classes in the same Java package, ex. org.w3c.dom.events.", "id": 140345, "time": "2010-10-01T03:12:59Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-01T03:12:59Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49897, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Isn't this issue very similar (possibly even a duplicate, or the way around) of bug 49206?\n\n\n(In reply to comment #2)\n> I've done these things to my local Batik working copy but right now I don't\n> remember which steps I took exactly.
