We're using 'Options MultiViews' in order to be able\nto work with clean URL's (URLs that pass arguments to scripts as if\nthey're directorynames)\n\nI'm using the following PHP script to test (example.php)\n\n<?\n$aParams = explode('/', substr($_SERVER[\"PATH_INFO\"],1));\nfor($i=0;$i<count($aParams);$i++) {\n        echo \"param \".$i.\" = \".$aParams[$i].\"<br />\\n\";\n}\n?>\n\non apache 1.3, when accessing http://server/example/1/2//3 we got the\nfollowing output:\n\nparam 0 = 1\nparam 1 = 2\nparam 2 =\nparam 3 = 3\n\nHowever, using the same script on apache 2.0, we got the following\noutput:\n\nparam 0 = 1\nparam 1 = 2\nparam 2 = 3\n\nit seems that apache2 is stripping the one slash, however this makes some\nproduction scripts of our client fail, as they do allow for empty\nvariables.\n\nis there a way to circumvent this behaviour and make apache2 pass the\nempty variable to the script as well ? Looking forward to your responses.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nFrans"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This is not a problem with multiviews. Actually the scripts are wrong (not\nconforming to RFC 2616).
