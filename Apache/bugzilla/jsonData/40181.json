[{"text": "The enhancement is ready and the patch is provided as an attachement :).\n\nBrief description:\n------------------\n\nIt allows seamless invocation of Session Beans following the EJB 2.1 specification.\n\nIt is composed of the\nfollowing components\n- Session Bean Configuration : It is a configuration element that\ncontains all necessary information to handle JNDI lookup/create Session Bean\nprotocol plumbing.\n- Session Bean Sampler : Contains the detail of the session bean method\ninvocation. It is based on standard Java reflection APIs. Method parameters are\ndefined by an extensible mechanism. A standard implementation allows preparation\nof parameter objects in a BeanShell sampler.\n\nThe GUI components that alllow to edit those controls are based on the\nexisting testbeans mechanism. A custom editor has also been introduced to allow\nselecting the session bean interface and method. JNDI InitialContextFactory, EJB\nHome and Remote interfaces are discovered automatically from the lib/ext directory\n\nA few other enhancement and bug fixes are also included in the patch to make it\nwork properly. I also updated the build.xml file \n\nThe following external jars are required at build and runtime :\n  * activation.jar\n  * geronimo-spec-j2ee-1.4-rc4.jar", "tags": [], "creator": "guillaume.lasnier@sungard.com", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 91875, "time": "2006-08-03T16:09:34Z", "bug_id": 40181, "creation_time": "2006-08-03T16:09:34Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40181, "text": "Created attachment 18676\nPatch as described in bug comment", "id": 91876, "attachment_id": 18676, "creator": "guillaume.lasnier@sungard.com", "creation_time": "2006-08-03T17:06:19Z", "time": "2006-08-03T17:06:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 40181, "is_private": false, "id": 92618, "time": "2006-08-28T13:29:21Z", "creator": "woolfel@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2006-08-28T13:29:21Z", "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the contribution, hopefully either sebb or I can take a look soon.\nHave you signed the apache contributor agreement yet?\n\npeter lin"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40181, "attachment_id": null, "id": 92623, "time": "2006-08-28T13:38:04Z", "creator": "guillaume.lasnier@sungard.com", "creation_time": "2006-08-28T13:38:04Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I faxed the CCLA to the ASF at the beginning of August."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40181, "text": "thanks for the quick response.
