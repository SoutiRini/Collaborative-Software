[{"count": 0, "text": "( First of all this problem/bug has been discussed on Java Technology Forums -\nhttp://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=45&thread=481803 - submitted by me,\nbut with no solution found yet )\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has made the same observation as I concerning the use of\n<fmt:formatDate ... /> and <fmt:formatNumber ... />. I've been using the tags in\na lot of places on my website, but recently I had to make a big list consisting\nof formatted dates and numbers - but everytime I exceed a certain amount of\n<fmt: ... /> uses, the page fails to load. So I decided to make a testfile in\norder to narrow the scope of possible causes. This is what I cam up with :\n\n<c:forEach var=\"cnt\" begin=\"1\" end=\"248\" varStatus=\"status\">\n<c:out value=\"${status.count}\" /> - <fmt:formatNumber value=\"${123456.789}\" /><br>\n</c:forEach>\n\nThe above works perfectly, but if I change 248 into 249 or above, the \"The page\ncannot be displayed\" appears. It seems that I am only allowed (?) to use the\n<fmt: ... /> -tag about 250 times.\n\nIs this an error on my side, a bug or something completely third?\n\nFor reference I am using JSTL 1.0 on JRun4 and Java vers. 1.4.2_01 - JRE\nStandard Edition (build 1.4.2_01-b06)\n\nPlease take a look at the above link, since it explains some of the\nobservations, tests and weird results I've been getting. Especially the \"fa0\"\nand headers are REALLY bug'ing me!", "bug_id": 26161, "attachment_id": null, "id": 50590, "time": "2004-01-15T11:44:24Z", "creator": "jacob@thydatacenter.dk", "creation_time": "2004-01-15T11:44:24Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 26161, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I've tried your simple test using the following combos:\n\n   J2SE 1.4.2\n\n   JSTL 1.0/Tomcat 4.1.24\n   JSTL 1.1-B1/Tomcat 5.0.16\n\n   Mozilla/IE.\n\nI set the repeat count to 10,000\n\nand everything worked fine.

If you can also make everything work with tomcat,\nthen it would definitely hint that there might be a problem with\njrun.
