Removed VectorAppender from log4j.receivers and fixed drivermanager xml configuration files\n - Test was also not passing because log4j logging events from DBReceiverJob were being received by Vectorappender and threw off the count - removed the unnecessary logging\n - Also fixed an issue with the conversion pattern used by read-with-drivermanager1.xml - to use %relative etc you have to specify an EnhancedPatternLayout instead of the standard PatternLayout"}]
