[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi, we're trying to solve very mysterious problem with apache frontend serving as reverse proxy for our CouchDB back-end servers. In production we have apache 2.2.25 version with the following configuration settings [1]. It correctly redirects traffic to our CouchDB backend (version 1.1). When we try new version of CouchDB (version 1.5, 1.6) we see timeouts in back-end log and our replication process does not proceed. The difference in CouchDB replication between different version is that latest ones rely on \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" while former does not. We enabled dumpio module in apache to get a snapshot of the traffic and what we see is replication process in progress, but it is aborted due to SSL timeout. Here [2] you can see server part of this process (I stripped off sensitive parts). I tried various apache proxy settings (proxy-sendchunks, etc) but nothing helps, except if I'll turn on downgrade-1.0. Using this option the replication works. Moreover, we did tested apache 2.4 and it works too without any tweaking. I also tested that problem exists with latest apache 2.2.29 version. I would appreciate any help/suggestions on how to debug this issue.\nThanks,\nValentin.\n\n[1] https://gist.github.com/vkuznet/cd8338f8a309ae788142\n[2] https://gist.github.com/vkuznet/8bb84a31eb5e40b0e255", "is_private": false, "id": 178349, "creation_time": "2014-10-08T16:15:47Z", "time": "2014-10-08T16:15:47Z", "creator": "vkuznet@gmail.com", "bug_id": 57069, "attachment_id": null}]
