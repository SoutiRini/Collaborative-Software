(But jre included with jdk you know)\n\nAfter installation I opened the Windows 2000 \"Services\" tool and tried to start\n\"Apache Tomcat\" service but it didn't start and I received following error \nmessage;\n\n\"Could not start the Apache Tomcat service on Local Computer. \nError 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a \ntimely fashion.\"\n\nI can start/stop Tomcat 5 with startup.bat and shutdown.bat without any problem.\n\nI think there was a problem about tomcat.exe or tomcatw.exe service \ninstallation parameters. But I couldn't find any documentation about Windows \nNT/2000/XP Service Installation in currect documentation bundle.\n\nFor example if I want to use tomcat zip distribution (jakarta-tomcat-\n5.0.14.zip) and make a manual installation (which it is better and flexible for \nme) I must know how to install the service with command line arguments. Or you \ncan put a batch file for this, it will be very usefull.\n\nI read \"http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/daemon/procrun.html\"  but I couldn't \ninstall tomcat5 service. I don't know what is the problem?\n\nThanks lot,"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 24943 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 48020, "time": "2003-11-24T16:48:15Z", "bug_id": 24942, "creation_time": "2003-11-24T16:48:15Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24942, "attachment_id": null, "id": 48022, "time": "2003-11-24T16:52:36Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-11-24T16:52:36Z", "is_private": false, "text": "If this cannot start, this likely means your JVM cannot be found for some reason\n(you moved it manually maybe); the installation uses the registry keys to locate\nyour VM (pay special  attention to the JVM path being chosen at that time, this\nwon't work if it's not right).\n\nI have yet to see this report be valid, so please use tomcat-user to debug this\nmore."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24942, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 81194, "time": "2005-10-16T08:50:34Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2005-10-16T08:50:34Z", "text": "I've been running 5.0.28 with JDK 1.4 on Windows 2000 for years now.
