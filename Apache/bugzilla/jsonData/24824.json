[{"text": "Forwarding Debian bug http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=70982\n\n--- begin quote ---\n\nApache will call suexec in \"user\" mode (specifying a user to su to), when\nany URL starts with ~.  It does not check if UserDir has been disabled before\ndoing this.\n\nViewCvs (and cvsweb) use the token \"~checkout~\" at the front of a URL to\nindicate that the file should be downloaded from CVS.  If a server is setup\nsuch as \"cvs.example.com\", with a rewrite rule pointing at the CGI script,\nsuexec will be run, and try to switch to user \"checkout\", which is incorrect.\n\nThis bug should probably be forwarded upstream.  I think a test to see if\nuserdir is disabled, and if so, pass any parameters verbatim, would solve\nthe problem.\n\n--- end quote ---\n\nNote that this specific problem is no longer relevant; viewcvs now uses\n*checkout* instead of ~checkout~, but there may be other situations when\nthis is inappropriate.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 24824, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 47624, "time": "2003-11-19T14:02:29Z", "creator": "willy@debian.org", "creation_time": "2003-11-19T14:02:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "text": "(Fixed in 2.0)", "id": 67907, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 24824, "creation_time": "2004-12-03T20:59:32Z", "time": "2004-12-03T20:59:32Z", "is_private": false}]
