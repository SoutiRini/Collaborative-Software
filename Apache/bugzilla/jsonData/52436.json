This used to work perfectly till we upgraded from mod_fcgid 2.3.5 to mod_fcgid 2.3.6. Since then, our fcgid process is not started anymore if the ScriptAlias directive in httpd.conf contains a space. Instead, I see the following in the error log of apache:\n\n326 [Fri Jan 06 11:30:01 2012] [notice] Apache/2.2.21 (Unix) mod_fcgid/2.3.6 configured -- resuming normal operations\n327 [Fri Jan 06 11:30:03 2012] [warn] [client 77.58.246.206] (104)Connection reset by peer: mod_fcgid: error reading data from FastCGI server\n328 [Fri Jan 06 11:30:03 2012] [error] [client 77.58.246.206] Premature end of script headers: somename.fcgi\n\nIt's only the space in ScriptAlias that causes the trouble. Nothing else. And after we downgraded back to mod_fcgid 2.3.5, it works like a charm.\n\nBest\nDavid"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52436, "text": "Forgot to write that I tested it on Ubuntu 10.04 and on Ubuntu 11.10.", "count": 1, "id": 152610, "time": "2012-01-06T12:58:05Z", "creator": "david.graf@28msec.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-06T12:58:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52436, "text": "This is also broken on Windows.
