Writing this for instance  \n<my:tag value=\"foo\\\"bar\\\"\"/>  \nwon't work, since the \" before bar is regarded as closing quote for the  \nattribute.  \n  \nSymptom:  \na JspException with 'jsp.error.attribute.noequal' is thrown, since the  \nremaining bar... is regarded as name of the next attribute which of course has  \nnot equals sign.  \n  \nSolution:  \noverread the next character if a backslash is seen. An conservative  \nimplementation of this fix you find at  \n  \n<http://www.freiheit.com/users/hzeller/BackslashInAttributeValue-BUG.patch.gz> \nthis is against a current CVS.", "attachment_id": null}]
