The workaround there is to apply inputstring=\"\" as parameter to java or exec tasks. However, the junit task does not support such a parameter, so the workaround does not apply to junit tasks.\n\nSo I'm left without a workaround.\n\nSuggested solutions: implement input and inputstring parameters for junit ant task.", "attachment_id": 28784}]
