If a vulnerable OpenSSL version is detected, a suitable warning should be logged.  Hopefully this will prompt webmasters to upgrade OpenSSL to a patched version.\n\nWith regard to Bug 50740 (Enable OCSP Stapling by default), I suggest that OCSP Stapling should not be enabled by default when a vulnerable OpenSSL version is detected.", "id": 144086, "time": "2011-02-09T04:40:28Z", "creator": "rob@comodo.com", "creation_time": "2011-02-09T04:40:28Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 50741 ***", "id": 144089, "time": "2011-02-09T04:51:58Z", "bug_id": 50742, "creation_time": "2011-02-09T04:51:58Z", "is_private": false}]
