I'm sorry for posting it here.\n\nFor some time now I have been monitoring Peruser MPM ( http://www.peruser.org/trac/peruser/ ). \nThe feature is really useful for web hosting companies and also for homemade servers used by developers.\nIs it possible this feature becomes a part of apache ? \n\nThe person who writes the patches has already done patches for the sources of apache 2.2.3-2.2.14.\nMy point is that he has already done the code - you'll just have to import it in your newer releases? \n\nP.S. I don't know the owner and if he'd accept this suggestion but I think apache really needs something like this as an core feature. \n\nWish you all the best,\nMe", "id": 138462, "time": "2010-07-16T09:24:58Z", "creator": "flood@itnews-bg.com", "creation_time": "2010-07-16T09:24:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49602, "attachment_id": null, "text": "The developers of peruser would need to approach the project themselves, via the dev@httpd mailing list or perhaps via private@httpd.apache.org if they want to explore the possibility quietly.\n\nFuture httpd 2.4 will support loadable MPMs (i.e., switch MPMs by changing the LoadModule directive), so it becomes much easier to consume MPMs provided by third parties.
