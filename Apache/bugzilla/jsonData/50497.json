[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50497, "is_private": false, "text": "(I'm forwarding bug report #605941 I created for Debian.)\n\nWhen converting RDF into XMP, libxmlgraphics-commons-java ignores rdf:resource attributes and instead leaves the properties completely empty.  This is  problematic because certain common uses of RDF and XMP (e.g. cc:license attributes) are best used with rdf:resource.  Attached is a patch which parses and emits rdf:resource attributes normally.\n\nAlso, while the 2005 specification was not clear on whether rdf:resource was allowed in XMP, the 2008 specification (part 1, section 7.5) makes it clear that it is permissible.", "id": 142845, "time": "2010-12-19T16:26:27Z", "creator": "sandals@crustytoothpaste.net", "creation_time": "2010-12-19T16:26:27Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sandals@crustytoothpaste.net", "attachment_id": 26422, "id": 142846, "time": "2010-12-19T16:33:45Z", "bug_id": 50497, "creation_time": "2010-12-19T16:33:45Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 26422\nsupport for rdf:resource"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 157797, "time": "2012-04-10T19:06:21Z", "bug_id": 50497, "creation_time": "2012-04-10T19:06:21Z", "is_private": false, "text": "patch landed at http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1311929&view=rev\n\nn.b. as supplied, the patch produced a regression in junit tests, specifically XMPParserTest.testParseEmptyValues(), which i fixed by ensuring res != null in XMPHandler changes:\n\n                        if ( res != null ) {\n                            try {\n                                URI resource = new URI(res);\n                                getCurrentArray(true).add(resource);\n                            } catch (URISyntaxException e) {\n                                throw new SAXException(\"rdf:resource value is not a well-formed URI\", e);\n                            }\n                        }\n\nit would be nice if you could submit an additional patch that extends o.a.x.xmp.XMPParserTest to test the new functionality added by your patch\n\nthanks brian!"}]
