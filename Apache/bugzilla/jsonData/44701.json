I wrote a Module based om mod_vhost_alias and added some extra features like own Host Settings. I implented a feature to chance PHP-Options and also the Dir Settings with the Apache Direktive \"Options\" (Indexes, FollowSymLinks, etc)\n\nAll the time I used this Module with an Apache I can download with the Command:\n\"apt-get install apache2\". (Modul tested with Debian stable and Debian sid)\nFew days ago I had to compile my own Apache and downloaded the newest Source 2.2.8 and compilied it. But my Module doesn't change the Options anymore. (also when I compilie it like the one I can load with apt-get)\n\nI parse the Options in the url-translate section form the Apache. So what are my mistake that it doesn't work? Or what is the difference between my Version from Apache and the one I can load with apt-get? Or is it really a bug?\n\n\nSorry for my english.", "id": 115073, "time": "2008-03-28T08:31:51Z", "creator": "fanste@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2008-03-28T08:31:51Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44701, "is_private": false, "text": "Nothing in this report suggests an apache bug.
