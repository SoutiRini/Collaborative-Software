Would it be possible to define custom \nerror page if somebody tries to access url that falls into context of a stopped \nweb application?\n\nI really do not want to undeploy my application but I need to make it \nunavailable once in a while in order to do some maintanance. It would be very \nnice to have a custom web page explaining that this web application is shut \ndown for some reason and will be up again after ... minutes.\n\nWhat do you think? Or can it be done allready without undeploying application?\n\nwith very best wishes,\nTaavi"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3712, "attachment_id": null, "id": 6038, "time": "2001-09-25T18:49:14Z", "creator": "craig.mcclanahan@sun.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-25T18:49:14Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Deferred until a later release (unless someone comes up with a patch that\naccomplishes this feature).\n"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 8649, "time": "2001-12-05T16:17:52Z", "bug_id": 3712, "creation_time": "2001-12-05T16:17:52Z", "text": "Reopen before closing."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3712, "text": "Apparently, I forgot to close it.\n\nThis problem can't be solved, since an error page is essentially a forward to a\nURL in the same context.
