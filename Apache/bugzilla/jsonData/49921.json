The Tomcat server hosts a spring 3.0 based application.\n \nThe clients of this application are embedded devices that use HTTP/1.1 protocol and send chunked http requests to the server that include trailers as well.\nThe application hosted by Tomcat does not see any of those trailers, I was expecting to find them as additional headers (per RFC 2616, 14.40) in the http request object. \nThere are no messages in the Apache's error log file.\n \nIt seems like Apache web server does not support trailers handling on http requests (I know for sure Tomcat does not support it).\n \nHere is a sample chunked http request to give you an idea:\n=================================================================\nPOST /controller HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=ISO-8859-1\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nTE: chunked\nTrailer: x-Content-Signature\n \n358\n<request body - first chunk>\n240\n<request body - last chunk>\n0\nx-Content-Signature: <signature>\n=================================================================\n\nThe \"x-Content-Signature\" trailer does not get transferred into the request headers. \n\nThanks,\nDan Luca.", "id": 139853, "time": "2010-09-13T22:34:35Z", "creator": "dan.luca@bsci.com", "creation_time": "2010-09-13T22:34:35Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
