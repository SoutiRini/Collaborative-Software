The attached \npatches add this capability and also update the documentation (or at least the \ndocumentation I could find).\n\nI also considered that a more complex syntax with parantheses, and operators \nfor AND, OR, and NOT could be useful, but decided they weren't really \nnecessary.  NOT can be simulated using the value=\"\" attribute, and AND can be \nsimulated by nesting multiple <req:isUserInRole> tags within each-other.
