A new class of error message began to\nappear in the error_log, once every day or two:\nHandler for type-map returned invalid result code 53\nThe associated entry in access_log was:\n \"GET /1n/warthog.jpg HTTP/1.1\" 500 - \n\nI posted this to the apache user mailing list, but there was no reply. \nMeanwhile I augmented the error message routine in the Apache source and\nrebuilt.  Since then there was one such new error message:\n\nHandler for type-map (file\n/usr/local/apache2/error/HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.html.var, type text/html;\ncharset=iso-8859-1) returned invalid result code 53\n\nOnce again the access_log entry was for one of the thumbnails that accompanies\nour front page:\nGET /1n/serval.jpg HTTP/1.1\" 500 - \n\nThis looks like chickens and eggs.  Something in apache decided to post a 500,\nand then there was a problem with serving the multilingual 500 page.\n\nLooks like the type in the error message isn't of much use.  Should I change\nthe error message to display the handler and file from the 'prev' request\nrecord (if any)?  Any other suggestions for looking at this problem would be\nappreciated.\n\nThe jpg's in the two examples are cached by:\nCacheFile /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/1n/aardvark.jpg\n\nOne fixup handler of mine is active for such jpg's, but it for sure only\nreturns OK :-)    \n\nThere was also one message that was different:\nHandler for modperl returned invalid result code 53\nunable to include \"/navbar2?cont=32\" in parsed file\n/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/springbuck.html\naccess_log:\n\"GET /springbuck.html HTTP/1.1\" 200 11360\n\nThere were no such error messages on substantially the same site for many\nmonths under 2.2.11."}]
