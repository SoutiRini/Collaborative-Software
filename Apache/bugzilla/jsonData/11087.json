The conf for out \nproduction environment is :\n\nWeb Server\t:\tApache Web Server 1.3.24\nServlet Runner\t:\tApache Tomcat 3.2.3\nOperating Sys\t:\tWin2k Advance Server\n\nWe are using Jdk1.3.0. Now the problem is like this.\n\nWe have few web-pages in our application. Each page has one unique request id \nassociated. Depending Upon the request id in user request we generate the \noutput web page. Some of our web-pages are continuously refreshed every 1-\nminute.\n\nNow suppose I am at a page with request id 1 (which is refreshed automatically) \nand some other user is at some other auto-refreshing page with some other \nrequest id.\nIf I leave the web-page open for some time then either I will get redirected to \nsome other page or I get some error page. After thorough analysis of the \nproblem I came to\nknow that this is the problem with http session. The request id for one user \nsession is taken by the another user session which further cause these errors. \nDo we need to do some configuration for maintaining proper sessions in Apache. \n\nPlease give a early reply as we are facing this problem on our production site.\n\nThanks"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "madhu_nalla@satyam.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 20458, "time": "2002-07-31T06:45:24Z", "bug_id": 11087, "creation_time": "2002-07-31T06:45:24Z", "is_private": false, "text": "We did not get any reply for this bug till now.
