Then do a graceful restart, and use a browser\nto access a directory that would be subject to indexing and that contains a\nsubdirectory. Observe the broken image next to the subdirectory.\n\nSolution: Either add copies of dir.gif & dir.png to the Apache distribution as\nfolder.gif and folder.png, or do whatever is needed to ensure that copies get\ncreated at install time.\n\nThanks!\n\n- Mike <mike@hyperreal.org> (original contributor of the small icon set)", "id": 70802, "time": "2005-02-11T00:31:45Z", "bug_id": 33508, "creation_time": "2005-02-11T00:31:45Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33508, "is_private": false, "text": "Changed summary to improve searchability", "id": 70874, "time": "2005-02-12T02:05:39Z", "creator": "mike@hyperreal.org", "creation_time": "2005-02-12T02:05:39Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 106108, "time": "2007-07-31T12:17:56Z", "bug_id": 33508, "creation_time": "2007-07-31T12:17:56Z", "text": "Several years later...\n\nI just renamed dir to folder in trunk, since dir is never used.
