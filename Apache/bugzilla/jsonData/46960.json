This is more easily explained with an example. So I have attached the example FO. In this example there are 3 pages, with the marker retrieved to the header. The marker is cleared on the first page, set on page 2 and cleared on page 3. So I only expect the Continued text to appear in the header of page but it also appears on page 3 as well.\n\nChanging <fo:marker marker-class-name=\"Continued\"/> to\n\n<fo:marker marker-class-name=\"Continued\"><fo:block></fo:block></fo:marker>\n\nsolves the problem, but this is a bug that ought to be fixed.", "count": 0, "id": 125972, "time": "2009-04-03T06:16:40Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-04-03T06:16:40Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "text": "Just noticed a mistake in the description the number 2 is missing from after the word page when describing where the Continued text is expected to appear.", "id": 125973, "time": "2009-04-03T06:18:11Z", "bug_id": 46960, "creation_time": "2009-04-03T06:18:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "\nFixed with r781944.\n\nThanks for reporting!", "attachment_id": null, "id": 127670, "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "time": "2009-06-05T01:43:42Z", "bug_id": 46960, "creation_time": "2009-06-05T01:43:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 46960, "id": 155816, "time": "2012-04-01T06:42:34Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:42:34Z", "attachment_id": null}]
