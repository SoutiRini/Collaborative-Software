[{"text": "This is a feature request for REMOTE_PORT to be added to the server-variables\navailable to mod_rewrite.  \n\nOther than for completeness, the reason this is needed is that Cisco has a class\nof router that identifies user specific routing sessions with signalling that is\nbased on the source port of the TCP/IP connection.  Web based software dealing\nwith these routers has had to use customized HTTP servers (normally based on\nJetty).  Having this server variable available in mod_rewrite would allows a\nstandard httpd to be used with these routers.\n\nregards", "tags": [], "bug_id": 25772, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 49729, "time": "2003-12-27T10:05:09Z", "creator": "gregw@mortbay.com", "creation_time": "2003-12-27T10:05:09Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25772, "attachment_id": null, "id": 49730, "time": "2003-12-27T10:07:03Z", "creator": "gregw@mortbay.com", "creation_time": "2003-12-27T10:07:03Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I think enhancement request 18579 may also be related to this type of Cisco Router."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25772, "attachment_id": null, "id": 50429, "time": "2004-01-12T22:42:10Z", "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "creation_time": "2004-01-12T22:42:10Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I've added the variable in 2.1 (main development branch) and proposed it for\nbackport into 2.0 and 1.3."}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "text": "Finally included into 2.0 and 1.3, so it will appear in the next releases.\n\nThanks for using Apache.", "id": 51309, "time": "2004-01-28T19:52:50Z", "bug_id": 25772, "creation_time": "2004-01-28T19:52:50Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
