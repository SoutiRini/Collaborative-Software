[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5481, "is_private": false, "text": "I'm not sure what is causing this problem, whether it is the Standard taglib implementation or a \nbug in Tomcat 4.0.1.\n\nBasically, I am trying to use the new Standard taglib to perform XSL \ntransformations. What my pages do is use the core:import tag to load an XSL from a local resource \nfile and pass it to a xml:transform.\n\nThis works fine under IE 5.5 and Netscape but under Opera \n5 and 6 I get very strange behaviour.\n\nThe first time I visit the page it works fine, but if I \nvisit the page from another page the import does not happen. The attribute in the page context has \nbeen created but it is empty.\n\nI have created a small web archive to demostrate this and have \nattached it. You will need to put the EA3 jars in the WEB-INF lib directory before it works.\n\nTo \nget this strange behaviour you have to vist the two pages using the links provided. After a couple \nof visits the imported text on the first page does not get displayed unless you do a refresh on that \npage.\n\nI have also included a request/response dump from catalina which shows this \nprocedure first done with IE and then using Opera. The only major difference that I can see is the \nheader-referer field.\n\nOnce again, this works fine in IE and Netscape.\n\nThanks.\nSam.", "id": 8986, "time": "2001-12-18T04:12:50Z", "creator": "sam.cooper@scisys.co.uk", "creation_time": "2001-12-18T04:12:50Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5481, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 913\nRequest response debug output from Tomcat 4.0.1", "id": 8987, "time": "2001-12-18T04:14:09Z", "creator": "sam.cooper@scisys.co.uk", "creation_time": "2001-12-18T04:14:09Z", "attachment_id": 913}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sam.cooper@scisys.co.uk", "attachment_id": 914, "id": 8988, "time": "2001-12-18T04:15:05Z", "bug_id": 5481, "creation_time": "2001-12-18T04:15:05Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 914\nExample web archive which shows problem"}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 5481, "is_private": false, "id": 8992, "time": "2001-12-18T06:45:16Z", "creator": "sam.cooper@scisys.co.uk", "creation_time": "2001-12-18T06:45:16Z", "tags": [], "text": "After further testing it seems it has nothing to do with the referer field but to do with the if-\nmodified-since field, something that Opera always provides once it has seen a page but IE does not \nseem to.\n\nI have created a little Java program to do this, you will have to edit it to provide the \ncorrect URL!\n"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5481, "attachment_id": 915, "is_private": false, "id": 8993, "time": "2001-12-18T06:46:11Z", "creator": "sam.cooper@scisys.co.uk", "creation_time": "2001-12-18T06:46:11Z", "text": "Created attachment 915\nJava http request code that shows the same problem."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "bayern@essentially.net", "attachment_id": null, "id": 8998, "time": "2001-12-18T07:48:42Z", "bug_id": 5481, "creation_time": "2001-12-18T07:48:42Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Sam,\n\nThanks for the detailed information.
