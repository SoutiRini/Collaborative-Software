The problem is that the jar file path passed to Java is a cygwin style path and needs to be converted to a windows style path (since java is a native windows application).\n\nI included a simple fix below, butof course there are many ways to accomplish the same thing, not sure what your preferred conventions are.  One could also use a similar OS test to include the MAC specific tweaks in one common *nix launch script.\n\nI did notice that invoking jmeter.bat seemed to properly launch, but I am loath to change ALL of our testing scripts that launch jmeter in different was depending on which *nix platform I'm running on.  I found it easier to just tweak the primordal jmeter script.  I presume others would also benefit the same way\n\nBest regards\n-- Charlie\n\nP.S.  Would it be useful to add CYGWIN as an OS-type for the bug reports?\n\nOne possible patch:\n\n$ diff -c jmeter ORIG/\n*** jmeter      2013-07-13 11:31:47.145846700 -0400\n--- ORIG/jmeter 2013-07-13 11:45:32.882489700 -0400\n***************\n*** 87,97 ****\n\n  ARGS=\"$SERVER $DUMP $HEAP $NEW $SURVIVOR $TENURING $EVACUATION $RMIGC $PERM\"\n\n! #java $ARGS $JVM_ARGS -jar \"`dirname \"$0\"`/ApacheJMeter.jar\" \"$@\"\n! # If running under cygwin, convert the jar path to windows format\n! if uname | grep -i --quiet 'cygwin' ; then\n!     jarpath=$(cygpath -w \"`dirname \"$0\"`/ApacheJMeter.jar\")\n!     java $ARGS $JVM_ARGS -jar \"$jarpath\" \"$@\"\n! else\n!     java $ARGS $JVM_ARGS -jar \"`dirname \"$0\"`/ApacheJMeter.jar\" \"$@\"\n! fi\n--- 87,90 ----\n\n  ARGS=\"$SERVER $DUMP $HEAP $NEW $SURVIVOR $TENURING $EVACUATION $RMIGC $PERM\"\n\n! java $ARGS $JVM_ARGS -jar \"`dirname \"$0\"`/ApacheJMeter.jar\" \"$@\"", "id": 168578, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 55260, "creation_time": "2013-07-13T15:48:04Z", "time": "2013-07-13T15:48:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "graham@ham1.co.uk", "text": "Running ./bin/jmeter.sh with v3.1 works for me on latest Cygwin + Win 7.\n\nCan this be closed or have I missed something?", "id": 196517, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 55260, "creation_time": "2017-01-28T09:45:42Z", "time": "2017-01-28T09:45:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "felix.schumacher@internetallee.de", "text": "If it is running, I think you can close it.", "id": 196519, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 55260, "creation_time": "2017-01-28T11:10:01Z", "time": "2017-01-28T11:10:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55260, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks Graham for testing.Closing", "id": 196524, "time": "2017-01-28T12:34:03Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2017-01-28T12:34:03Z", "is_private": false}]
