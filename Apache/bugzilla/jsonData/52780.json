I stumbled on a couple of bugs in handling of AddOutputFilterByType in 2.4.1 when running mod_pagespeed's integration tests against it, which the attached patch should fix:\n\n1) in filter_bytype, there is an off-by-one in writing the null termination of the  types array.\n\n2) In add_filter, only one of the ->types or ->expr fields is written, but the structure is allocated without zeroing, so you can end up with a junk value of the other field."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 52755 ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 154293, "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "time": "2012-02-27T18:38:57Z", "bug_id": 52780, "creation_time": "2012-02-27T18:38:57Z", "is_private": false}]
