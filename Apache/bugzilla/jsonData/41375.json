[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41375, "text": "Albeit probably not best practice, I was in the throws of testing things and\njust happend to try and use the same SSLCertificateFile for two different\nVirtualHost servers running on two different ports, with the same ServerName.\n\nBoth worked fine untill I changed the ServerName of one of them in the config\nfile, the server would then crash on start up with practically no debug\ninformation or any pointers to a relevant cause. After a fair bit of fiddling\nabout I worked out that the ServerName change was the cause. I changed to using\ntwo different certificates and the problem went away.\n\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:18 2006] [info] Init: Seeding PRNG with 136 bytes of entropy\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:18 2006] [info] Init: Generating temporary RSA private keys\n(512/1024 bits)\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [info] Init: Generating temporary DH parameters\n(512/1024 bits)\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [info] Init: Initializing (virtual) servers for SSL\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [info] Server: Apache/2.2.3, Interface:\nmod_ssl/2.2.3, Library: OpenSSL/0.9.7c\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [info] mod_unique_id: using ip addr xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:20 2006] [info] Init: Seeding PRNG with 136 bytes of entropy\n\nIs all that would be written to the main error log.\n\nWith:\n\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [info] Configuring server for SSL protocol\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_init.c(405): Creating new SSL\ncontext (protocols: SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1)\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_init.c(729): Configuring RSA\nserver certificate\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [warn] RSA server certificate CommonName (CN) `xxx'\ndoes NOT match server name!?\n[Wed Dec 27 02:45:19 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_init.c(768): Configuring RSA\nserver private key\n\nBeing written to both of the relevant VirtualHost error logs.\n\nThis may well not be a bug, but an intended feature, could possibly do with a\n\"don't be silly!\" debug message ;)\n\nRegards,\n\n\nBrendan Boyd", "id": 98093, "time": "2007-01-15T16:46:35Z", "creator": "asfbugzilla@drbb.net", "creation_time": "2007-01-15T16:46:35Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41375, "attachment_id": null, "id": 108319, "time": "2007-09-18T03:08:08Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2007-09-18T03:08:08Z", "is_private": false, "text": "What does \"crash on startup\" mean, exactly?
