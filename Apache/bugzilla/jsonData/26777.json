This should, of course, only be done on systems that support\nextended attributes (thus I'm reporting this only for \"Linux\" - I don't know\nthe full list of systems that would support this). In the case of files\nthat haven't got the attribute set, it would of course be necessary to fall\nback to the usual apache mime type recognition methods.\n\nIt might be appropriate to make this optional (perhaps even on a\nper-directory-basis) even for systems that support it.\n\n(I suspect some systems, such as Mac OS (X) have similiar but different mime\ntype storage methods, which should be supported, but I haven't checked if\nthis is already the case.)\n\n\u00b9\n<URL:http://freedesktop.org/Standards/shared-mime-info-spec/0.12/ar01s03.html#id2767803>", "id": 51933, "time": "2004-02-08T19:51:22Z", "creator": "mjrauhal@cc.helsinki.fi", "creation_time": "2004-02-08T19:51:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I don't think mod_mime should do this.
