[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3642, "text": "As of the 2001.09.15 nightly build\n==================================\n\nAccording to the documentation \n(http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/installing.html), JMeter runs in a Java 1.2 \nenvironment.\n\nJMeter currently depends on JDK 1.3 for the following reasons:\n\n1. File: org.apache.gui.MainFrame.java \n   Method: addThemAll()\n   Introduced: File Version 1.7 \n\nThis method calls JSplitPane.setResizeWeight(double), which is a new method in \nJDK 1.3.\n\n2. File: org.apache.protocol.http.parser.HtmlParser.java\n   Method: createUrlFromAnchor(String, URL)\n   Introduced: File Version 1.8\n\nThis method calls URL.getPath(), which is a new method in JDK 1.3.\n\n3. File: org.apache.protocol.http.config.UrlConfig.java\n   Method: parseArguments(String)\n   Introduced: File Version 1.19\n\nThis method calls URLDecoder.decode(String). In JDK 1.2, the decode() method \nhas a throws clause: \"throws Exception\". In JDK 1.3, the method does not have a \nthrows clause. So, in order to be JDK 1.2 compliant, we need to add a try/catch \naround the method call.  \n\nFYI: Looking at the source code, I see two places where runtime exceptions can \nbe thrown.  First, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown if the URL-encoded \nvalue is an invalid hex number. Second, the method has a call to String.getBytes\n(String), which throws an UnsupportedEncodingException if the named encoding \n(in this case, 8859_1) is not supported.", "id": 5626, "time": "2001-09-16T09:48:30Z", "creator": "khammond25@home.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-16T09:48:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "khammond25@home.com", "is_private": false, "id": 5628, "attachment_id": 556, "bug_id": 3642, "creation_time": "2001-09-16T11:14:18Z", "time": "2001-09-16T11:14:18Z", "text": "Created attachment 556\nPatch for UrlConfig.java; file contains the diff"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "khammond25@home.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 557\nPatch for MainFrame.java; file contains the diff", "id": 5630, "time": "2001-09-16T12:14:37Z", "bug_id": 3642, "creation_time": "2001-09-16T12:14:37Z", "attachment_id": 557}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3642, "attachment_id": 559, "id": 5655, "time": "2001-09-17T05:50:55Z", "creator": "khammond25@home.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-17T05:50:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 559\nPatch for HtmlParser.java; file contains the diff"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "khammond25@home.com", "is_private": false, "text": "With the three patches I have attached, the code (up to 2001.09.15 nightly \nbuild) now compiles and runs in JDK1.2!
