This problem is also carried into Tomcat 4 too, by the \nway, and I have filed that bug report too.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use only Tomcat, alone, not \nin unison with the Apache web server.\n\n2. Create a directory structure under ROOT with the path \n/scripts/cookies, which the following files should be placed in.\n\n3. Create an index.html \nwith a hyperlink to begin the example. The\nhyperlink should go to write_cookie.jsp.\n\n4. \nwrite_cookie.jsp should create a new cookie \"fruit\" with value \"apple\". It should follow with a \nhyperlink which goes to read_cookie.jsp.\n\n5. read_cookie.jsp should perform a standard \ndump of the full cookie array. It should be preceeded with a test to see if the array is null, then \nreport no cookies found if this is true.\n\n6. Use a variety of browsers and run the two URL tests. I \nused IE 5.5 and Opera 6.01 in my tests and got the same results. I cleared my full cache on both, shut \ndown the browsers, and tried again with the same results. I turned off ZoneAlarm Pro and retried. \nSame result.", "id": 12907, "time": "2002-04-06T11:23:34Z", "bug_id": 7789, "creation_time": "2002-04-06T11:23:34Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7789, "attachment_id": 1494, "text": "Created attachment 1494\nSource Code", "id": 12908, "time": "2002-04-06T11:24:07Z", "creator": "reachmike@hotpop.com", "creation_time": "2002-04-06T11:24:07Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7789, "attachment_id": null, "text": "'localhost' isn't really a valid domain name.
