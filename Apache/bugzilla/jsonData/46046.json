When the application starts,\nthe timestamps used in our log files match the current local time,\nalbeit without an explicit time zone identifier included in the time,\nbut that's okay. However, if we change the time zone, e.g. from 8:00 am\nPDT to 8:00 am EDT, while the local time simply starts displaying the\nnew time zone identifier, the log timestamps get shifted by the\ndifference in the time zones. In this specific case, the log timestamps\nwould get shifted to 5:00 am.\n\n \n\nIf we then stop and restart the application, the timestamps are then\nbased again on the local time (8:00 am instead of 5:00 am). This is what\nwe want of course, but we want this to happen dynamically as well and\nnot have to restart the application to get the timestamps in sync with\nthe local time. How can we accomplish this? We want the timestamps to\nmatch whatever the local time is, regardless of the time zone, even\nafter a time zone change. Is there a logger call we can make?\n\nThread continues at http://marc.info/?l=log4j-user&m=122444718829901&w=2", "id": 121706, "time": "2008-10-20T15:56:15Z", "bug_id": 46046, "creation_time": "2008-10-20T15:56:15Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46046, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 123881, "time": "2009-01-08T10:23:57Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-01-08T10:23:57Z", "text": "Committed fix to extras EnhancedDateFormat in rev 706445 and 706451."}]
