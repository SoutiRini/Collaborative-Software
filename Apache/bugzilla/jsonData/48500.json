At\nthe top, the browser shows a warning bar that says \"This XML file does\nnot appear to have any style information associated with it. The\ndocument tree is shown below.\".  Below that, it... shows the document\ntree, complete with angle brackets and attributes and everything.  The\nbody of the message is visible, sort of, but this is surely not the\nintended UI :-).\n\nApparently, the javascript only overrides \"onclick\", but does not\noverride \"right click\".  So a regular click would be handled properly,\nbut a right click to open a new window is not -- it does not execute the\nJavaScript.  Thus the page defaults to the raw href, which is pretty\nuseless without a style sheet.\n\nI did this in Firefox 3.5.6, by the way, but I doubt the browser version\nmatters.\n\nHTH,\n-Karl"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48500, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 133535, "time": "2010-01-11T21:06:06Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-01-11T21:06:06Z", "text": "See attached URL and resulting thread for further observations."}]
