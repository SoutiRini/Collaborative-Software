Someone more familiar with the codebase may be able to suggest a better way to implement this more efficiently.\n\nIf we have a test plan with the following layout\n\nThread Group\n - Sampler ${foo}\n    - Pre-processor\n - Sampler2 ${foo}\n - Listener\n\n\nThe if the variable foo is set by the pre-processor then the value will appear in the label for both Sampler and Sampler2. \n\nThread Group\n - Sampler ${foo}\n    - Post-Processor\n - Sampler2 ${foo}\n - Listener\n\n\nIf it is set by the post-processor then the value will not appear for first sampler, but will appear in the second sampler Sampler2.
