The Batik SVG browser also displays them correctly (we used the same\nversion that is bundled with FOP 0.20.4).\n\nWe're using external SVG files, and when we remove the viewport attribute the\nrendered PDF is a little bit better but some clipping still exists.\n\nThanks, Christer."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16672, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 109634, "time": "2007-10-23T07:57:28Z", "creator": "pascal.sancho@takoma.fr", "creation_time": "2007-10-23T07:57:28Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 8463 ***"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 156983, "time": "2012-04-01T13:55:55Z", "bug_id": 16672, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:55:55Z", "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs"}]
