[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 29144\nPatch containing the modified message thrown in the exception.\n\nA request was recently made to check FOP's PDF/A-1a compatibility. During this process, it was necessary to enable a-1a mode from the configuration file (as opposed to the usual -pdfprofile parameter) and it was here during compilation the error \"PDF/A-1a requires the MarkInfo dictionary to be present\" was shown. It took some time to realize this message was simply down to accessibility option not being enabled. After consultation, it was decided that this message would be better to reflect and inform the user of the reason and method to resolve the issue.", "attachment_id": 29144, "id": 161030, "creator": "rmeyer@hotmail.co.uk", "time": "2012-07-31T14:22:05Z", "bug_id": 53630, "creation_time": "2012-07-31T14:22:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 161055, "time": "2012-08-02T11:18:20Z", "bug_id": 53630, "creation_time": "2012-08-02T11:18:20Z", "text": "Patch committed in rev. 1368419:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1368419&view=rev\n\nThanks!\nVincent"}]
