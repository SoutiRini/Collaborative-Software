[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42664, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi all,\nI was thinking of bridging JUL and log4j, so that existing log4j-enabled \napplications could correctly write to JUL-enabled environments, with the full \nlayout/filter/handler log4j support without code changes, and minimal config \nchanges.\n\nAt the moment, using the ConsoleAppender works fairly, except that the log4j \nlog levels are not mapped to JUL levels. For example, it is observed under \nSJSAS9 that all log4j messages show up at the INFO (stdout) or WARNING \n(stderr) level, regardless of what method (trace/debug/info/etc) the \napplication called.\n\nI have created a JulAppender to solve this issue. If you feel it is \nappropriate, feel free to review it and consider it as a log4j enhancement. \nUsage is simple: in log4j configuration, \nreplace \"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\" \nwith \"org.sagimann.log4j.JulAppender\". Everything else stays the same: \nlayouts, patterns, etc. Additional documentation is provided in the code at \nthe moment.\n\nAwaiting comments...\nThanks.", "id": 104406, "time": "2007-06-14T08:41:02Z", "creator": "sagimann@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-06-14T08:41:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42664, "attachment_id": 20349, "text": "Created attachment 20349\nJUL Appender (log4j-JUL bridge)", "id": 104411, "time": "2007-06-14T10:17:16Z", "creator": "sagimann@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-06-14T10:17:16Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": 20350, "creator": "sagimann@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 20350\nJUL Appender (log4j-JUL bridge)", "id": 104412, "time": "2007-06-14T10:28:26Z", "bug_id": 42664, "creation_time": "2007-06-14T10:28:26Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42664, "attachment_id": 20381, "text": "Created attachment 20381\ntestcase for JulAppender", "id": 104609, "time": "2007-06-21T14:44:30Z", "creator": "sagimann@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-06-21T14:44:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "psmith@apache.org", "text": "I'd like to propose that this class gets added to the jul-log4j-bridge project.\n I'd like to take this patch and modify to encorporate the LevelConverter\ninterface that's there to provide customized handling of the two-way level\nconversion.\n\nSee:\n\nhttp://people.apache.org/~psmith/logging.apache.org/sandbox/jul-log4j-bridge/apidocs/org/apache/logging/julbridge/JULLevelConverter.html\n\nThis appender could be initialized with the default implementation and be given\nproperty to set the class name of a custom implementation to use.\n\n", "id": 104672, "time": "2007-06-24T19:55:51Z", "bug_id": 42664, "creation_time": "2007-06-24T19:55:51Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
