The patch does not handle default NSS base directory for '--with-nss=yes'. \n\nExisting configuration (configure.ac) file does not support command line option for conditional build for Mozilla NSS.\nIt would be nice to have '--with-nss' option similar to '--with-openssl'. \n\nWhen invoked \"--with-nss=yes\", the configuration should pick up a default location supplied through a well-defined environment variable or OS-platform specific location. \n\nAlso, when '--with-openssl=no' is provided as option, the configuration builder should not check or create build options for OpenSSL at all. Currently, the code is built for OpenSSL even though lack of conditional 'HAVE_OPENSSL' pre-processor option comment out most of the OpenSSL related implementation.", "id": 138712, "time": "2010-07-28T12:55:06Z", "bug_id": 49662, "creation_time": "2010-07-28T12:55:06Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25812}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "cantor.2@osu.edu", "text": "Support for adding NSS and turning off OpenSSL has been added.", "id": 141016, "time": "2010-10-25T20:15:37Z", "bug_id": 49662, "creation_time": "2010-10-25T20:15:37Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
