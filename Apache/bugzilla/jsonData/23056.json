It appears that when log4j is first initialised that on creating the first\n   file, it adds two headers, this is because it calls the constructor of the\n   superclass (which calls the setFile method which writes the header), and the\n   activateOptions of the superclass (which also calls the setFile method). This\n   can be resovled by setting a flag in the WriterAppender class to see if it\n   has already been written.\n2. On roll over, the DailyRollingFileAppender does not write a footer to every\n   file. See bug 11446 for more details.\n3. The DailyRollingFileAppender does not allow you to append to files. This can\n   be fixed by adding a boolean flag to the constructor or by making the \n   setAppend method public.", "id": 43932, "time": "2003-09-10T09:14:07Z", "bug_id": 23056, "creation_time": "2003-09-10T09:14:07Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "text": "Hello,\n\n1) I don't observe this behaviour.
