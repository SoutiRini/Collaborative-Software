I don't see a reason for that to happen because Excel seems to be perfectly happy about long function names.\n\nMany thanks and best regards.", "id": 168379, "time": "2013-07-08T13:05:42Z", "creator": "dance@web.de", "creation_time": "2013-07-08T13:05:42Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55214, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 168380, "time": "2013-07-08T13:19:50Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2013-07-08T13:19:50Z", "text": "Are you able to work out the size that it trips over at? eg 8 chars works, 9 fails?\n\nIf so, it would be great if you could create two simple files in excel, one with a formula that POI likes, one that's one char longer. Then, use BiffViewer to compare the two files. If they both store it the same way, it's a POI bug. If the shorter one gets stored differently to the long one (eg there's a ShortForm record or a LongForm record), then that's an enhancement to work on"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nthanks for responding.
