[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20689, "text": "I'm using mod_jk2 with apache in \"worker\" mode, meaning that there are several \ndifferent httpd processes that stay alive (instead of forking) and are delegated \nrequests.  I noticed that when setting a jk2 channel to graceful by updating \nworkers2.properties and hitting the /jkstatus page, only one of the \"worker\" httpd's \nwould pick up the change.  Other httpd+mod_jk2 processes would continue to forward \nnew sessions to the \"graceful\" channel.  The solution was to access the /jkstatus page \nrepeatedly until every httpd process had served /jkstatus and picked up the changed \nattributes. \n \nIf possible, it would be more convenient if accessing /jkstatus a single time would cause \nall the httpd workers to check workers2.properties for updates. \n \nThanks!", "id": 38732, "time": "2003-06-11T19:29:36Z", "creator": "crozierm@conducivetech.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-11T19:29:36Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "As of November 15, 2004, JK2 is no longer supported.
