Example: source specifies font size 10, which due to rounding errors is scaled to size 9.995, such font size does not exist and the warning message of the type \"font X with size 9.995pt not found, replaced by size 10.0pt\" is output. The patch suppresses the warning message if the difference in font sizes between what is searched and what is found is less than 0.1.", "id": 152548, "time": "2012-01-03T09:13:37Z", "creator": "lmpmbernardo@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-03T09:13:37Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52416, "is_private": false, "text": "Hi Luis,\n\nThanks for submitting the patch.
