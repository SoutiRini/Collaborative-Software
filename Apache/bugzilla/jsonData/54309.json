[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54309, "text": "Hi.\n\nThe documentation of the <Location> directive (https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/en/mod/core.html#location) tells about how it changes when used with proxy requests:\n\"For all origin (non-proxy) requests, the URL to be matched is a URL-path of the form /path/. No scheme, hostname, port, or query string may be included. For proxy requests, the URL to be matched is of the form scheme://servername/path, and you must include the prefix.\"\n\nI think two things should be clarified here:\n\n1) As far as I can see,... the above does not apply when using a reverse proxy...\ni.e. only with forward proxies, the prefix of schema/domain must be added, right?\n\n\n2) Not sure whether this is possible at all:\nCan I have a location which apply to both, proxied and non-proxied content? If so, how is it determined, which Location sections apply?\n\n\nCheers,\nChris.", "id": 164091, "time": "2012-12-15T20:51:03Z", "creator": "calestyo@scientia.net", "creation_time": "2012-12-15T20:51:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
