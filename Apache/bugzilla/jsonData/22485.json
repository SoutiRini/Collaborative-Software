The resulting pdf has the correct content, but is clipped so that\nonly the upper left corner is visible, both when I open it with Acrobat Reader 5\nand when I open it with OS X Preview.app.  Also, when I attempt to open the file\nin Adobe Illustrator, it fails, with the message \"Acrobat PDF file format is\nhaving difficulties.  Could not create internal representation of XAP metadata.\"\n\nCuriously, the entireBatik rasterization to image/png does not have the same\nproblem, the whole image is visible.  It's possible that there's some problem\nwith my input svg (since I generated it myself) but it has height, width, and\nviewBox attributes and is displayed correctly by Adobe Illustrator and by the\nAdobe SVG browser plugin, and is handled correctly by batik-rasterizer -m\nimage/png.
