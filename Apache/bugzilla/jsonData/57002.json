I log the activity of those scripts in files but I also want to send logs to Chainsaw, if there is a Chainsaw running.\n\nThe problem is that if there is no Chainsaw running, the SocketAppender takes some 15 seconds in the connect() method. The result is that my script takes 15 seconds waiting for a Chainsaw that does not exist and then some 4 seconds to actually run.\n\nDebug showed that the SocketAppender is taking 10 seconds on address.getHostName(), in the following line:\n\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/1.2.17/org/apache/log4j/net/SocketAppender.java#230\n\nThis is just an error log and in this case I do not care about such error, since logs are already going to a FileAppender.\n\nSo my suggestion is that the SocketAppender should have a new property to turn off those error messages if they are not needed, as they may hurt performance."}]
