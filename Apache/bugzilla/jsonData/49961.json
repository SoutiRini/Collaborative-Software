[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49961, "text": "There was a similar bugreport against 1.8.0 which complaint about the bad performance of the attrib task. \nsee https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48734\nThis Bugreport has been marked as resolved while attib still has approx. 500ms to complete for one single file in 1.8.1.\n\nWe recently set up our CI Server from scratch and installed ant 1.8.1 on it.\nAfter the new setup, our builds took two times as long as before (same HW).\nAfter searching for the reason for quite a long time, it turned out that attrib takes 22 Minutes to complete (setting readonly to false for 3000 files).\nAfter reverting back to 1.7.1, this task now takes again 40 seconds like ti was before....\n\nSo ant 1.8.1 is really not usable for us anymore. We have to stay with 1.7.1 as long as this performance is that bad.\n\nI can not follow the conclusion in the \"resolved\" 48734, as of \"500ms should be enough\" since the former version was broken.\nFor us, the former version of attrib (up to 1.7.1) worked perfectly well for years now. Never had a problem with it. Just did what I expected it to do. The new version seems to have fixed some bug somwhere (which I never encountered) but as a result, attrib is unusable now.", "count": 0, "id": 139973, "time": "2010-09-20T08:10:12Z", "creator": "schlm3@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-09-20T08:10:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49961, "attachment_id": null, "id": 140021, "time": "2010-09-21T10:54:38Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-09-21T10:54:38Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 49888 ***"}]
