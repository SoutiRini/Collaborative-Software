I am a Java programmer and I do not have \nC++ compiler. \nCurrently I do not know what to do about it.\nCan you please post all of these components on one side, so it can be ready to \nuse. Hunting for all those components is very time consuming and frustrating.\nYour help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 60464, "time": "2004-07-12T11:51:35Z", "bug_id": 29582, "creation_time": "2004-07-12T11:51:35Z", "tags": [], "text": "Official binaries with SSL support depends on US politics (at least they did), \nbut since the kerberos can be downloaded from MIT site for year or so, I see no \nreason why we cannot have a 'official' SSL distribution.\n\nAnyhow, this question has to be put to https guys."}]
