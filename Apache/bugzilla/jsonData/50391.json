I have reviewed it and found a couple of issues. There were some minor conflicts due to the age of the patch that I resolved. I also had to update the tests to Junit4. My question is around the AllTests class added to the pagination package. 2 test were added to this package:\n\nPageSequenceMasterTestCase\nRepeatablePageMasterAlternativesTestCase\n\nbut the AllTest class only references PageSequenceMasterTestCase. Is that intentional or should it also reference the RepeatablePageMasterAlternativesTestCase?\n\nThanks,\n\nChris"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50391, "attachment_id": null, "id": 152656, "time": "2012-01-10T15:24:10Z", "creator": "peter.hancock@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-10T15:24:10Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Well spotted Chris, RepeatablePageMasterAlternativesTestCase should be run.\n\nThe AllTest class should contain something like\n\n@SuiteClasses({ PageSequenceMasterTestCase.class, RepeatablePageMasterAlternativesTestCase.class })"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks Peter.
