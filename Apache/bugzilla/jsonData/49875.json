But when trying to open the created Excel file, Excel shows a dialog box saying that non-readable content has been found and asks whether Excel should recover the content.\n\nI would except HSSF and XSSF to behave the same way and throw an exception when trying to create a sheet with an invalid name.\n\n\nThe above behaviour can be reproduced by using the workbook.createSheet function.\n\n\nOS: Windows 7 64bit\nPOI: 3.7-beta2\nJava: 1.6.0_20 64bit"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49875, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed in r992629\n\nRegards,\nYegor", "id": 139696, "time": "2010-09-04T11:57:21Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2010-09-04T11:57:21Z", "is_private": false}]
