[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11873, "text": "On line 457 of org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.SQLExec of the Ant v1.5 full \nrelease source code, a comment describes \"--\" as a SQL \"comment to end of \nline\" flag, which is correct.  The code then appends a newline character at \nthe end of the \"comment\" and the next line in the SQL script is appended.  \n\nI think that this is incorrect behavior in the case where the SQL statement \ncontains a string being inserted which itself contains the \"--\" pattern.  For \nexample, the following SQL statments would break because they would be \nappended together:\n\ninsert into PERSON values (\"Michael -- not a SQL expert\", \"Brinkman\");\ninsert into PERSON values (\"John\", \"Doe\");\n\nI'm definitely not a SQL expert, so I may be incorrect in assuming the \nbehavior to be wrong, but if it is incorrect behavior, let me say that it's \nhard to work around.\n\nFixing this behavior would be non-trivial because it would require parsing the \nstatement to understand if the \"--\" string was part of a string being inserted \nin the database.", "id": 21411, "time": "2002-08-20T20:24:08Z", "creator": "michael@michaelbrinkman.com", "creation_time": "2002-08-20T20:24:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 23900, "time": "2002-10-04T12:03:56Z", "bug_id": 11873, "creation_time": "2002-10-04T12:03:56Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 10719 ***"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "*** Bug 13196 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "count": 2, "id": 23903, "time": "2002-10-04T12:04:45Z", "bug_id": 11873, "creation_time": "2002-10-04T12:04:45Z", "is_private": false}]
