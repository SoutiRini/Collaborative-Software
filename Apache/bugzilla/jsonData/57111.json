[{"text": "If I use <echo> or <fail> with a multi-line message, and the message text is indented like normal for an XML file, then the first line of the message is printed out unindented, but the rest are printed indented (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26417941).  I can not indent the lines within the build.xml file, but that looks ugly.  It would be nice if there was some sort of \"prettify\" parameter which could be given to those tasks which would caused the indentation to be stripped out.  Also doing some sort of line wrapping, so that lines of text would be joined together and then split at word boundaries when reaching column 80, would be nice.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 57111, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 178574, "time": "2014-10-18T04:43:36Z", "creator": "matt@nightrealms.com", "creation_time": "2014-10-18T04:43:36Z", "attachment_id": null}]
