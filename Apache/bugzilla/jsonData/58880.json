Without this extension, every users enters a lottery were the lucky winner have to wait while the backend generates a new response (the \u201cThundering Herd\u201d revalidating-lock logic). That user will be dissatisfied.\n\nThis unlucky user is often a search engine, which will access every resource and is highly likely to encounter expired resources. Site speed being an important metric in modern search ranking causes websites running httpd to be negatively affected.\n\n\nRFC 5861 also adds \u201cCache-Control: stale-if-error=600\u201d, but httpd already provides this through the CacheStaleOnError directive. Supporting this header would be good, but offers no immediate new benefit like stale-while-revalidate does.\n\nSimilar to the CacheStaleOnError directive, there should also be a CacheStaleWhileRevalidating directive."}]
