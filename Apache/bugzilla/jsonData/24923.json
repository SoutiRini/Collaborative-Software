Perhaps I'm just a crappy googler(?).\n\nAnyways, the issue is, that doing an apachectl configtest reports if there's a \nsyntax error, and not if paths to logfiles are bogus:\n\n% > apachectl graceful\n/usr/local/sbin/apachectl graceful: httpd gracefully restarted\n% >\n\nThis leaves the httpd daemon down.\nThis has also been tested on Apache 2.0.49.\n\nTo fix this, I've made a perl script which checks both syntax and logfile path, \nbefore doing apahcectl graceful.\nIf an error occurs I'm emailed about it, telling me what line there's a path \nerror or syntax error.\n\nSo my question/suggestion goes to add a check on logfile paths (not emaling as \na primary thing).\n\nI can't be the only person with this problem?\n\nKeep the project rolling :)", "id": 47943, "time": "2003-11-23T02:20:50Z", "creator": "bp@hipoxia.com", "creation_time": "2003-11-23T02:20:50Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
