[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50038, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hello,\n\nI've worked as a sysadmin with the Apache web-server for a few years.\nOften I want to know what set of apache directives are being applied\nto a file and/or directory. Sometimes because of error reports and\noften because the behaviour is not what I want. With experience I\nthink I've learned better how to configure apache httpd, however I\nstill run into situations where I really want to know what apache is\ndoing to server a particular file.\n\nI want to be able to find out what set of directives apache is applying to a piece of content when it is served.\n\nI've asked around and searched for something that will do this and not\nfound anything. Maybe I'm missing something...\n\nIf not then this might be a good piece of functionality to add to apache for a future release.\n\nregards,\n\nMike.", "id": 140375, "time": "2010-10-01T11:10:30Z", "creator": "esor.ekim@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-10-01T11:10:30Z", "is_private": false}]
