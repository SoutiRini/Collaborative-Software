The problem I had with the\ncurrent modifiers was that it only looked for attributes in the previous\nHTTP Request and only filtered out the first occurrence.  These values\ncould change each and every run for us.  So to make that work I created two\nmodifiers.  The first modifier filters out the session arguments for every\noccurrence and stores that information.  I patterned this class off of\nURLRewritingModifier and this works for the whole thread.  I created\nanother modifier, which I extended URLRewritingModifier.  I overrode the\n'modify' method to get one of the stored values that was filtered and call\nURLRewritingModifier's 'modify' method to finish the rewriting.  I had to\nchange the 'modify' method to 'protected' to make that work.  I ran into a\nproblem with all the modifiers when I was doing them remotely.  I found out\nthat the Perl5Compiler was 'null' on the remote side. So I created another\nmethod that is called 'getCompiler'.  This will check if it is 'null' and\nif so create a compiler and then return the value.   I also updated the\nmessages.properties files.", "id": 27761, "time": "2002-12-12T21:35:50Z", "creator": "chrispesarchick@westfieldgrp.com", "creation_time": "2002-12-12T21:35:50Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15334, "text": "Created attachment 4146\nThe changes for my discription.", "id": 27762, "time": "2002-12-12T21:37:14Z", "creator": "chrispesarchick@westfieldgrp.com", "creation_time": "2002-12-12T21:37:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 4146}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15334, "is_private": false, "text": "This is actually an enhancement, not a bug.\nLooks interesting.
