It allows you to configure a URI to test (using a GET request), and an expected HTTP status code.\n\nworker.tomcat_default.custom_check_expected_status=200\nworker.tomcat_default.custom_check_uri=/app/somefile\n\nThe reason for this is that we do rolling deploys across a cluster of Tomcat servers, and in the time the app is redeploying mod_jk continues to route requests to the Tomcat instance, resulting in 404's to our clients.\n\nIs this something which would be considered for inclusion in mod_jk? Does it need more work?\n\nThanks and Best Regards,", "id": 165535, "time": "2013-02-28T13:19:49Z", "creator": "alan.fitton@igmarkets.com", "creation_time": "2013-02-28T13:19:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54620, "attachment_id": null, "id": 165537, "time": "2013-02-28T13:45:16Z", "creator": "alan.fitton@igmarkets.com", "creation_time": "2013-02-28T13:45:16Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 54621 ***"}]
