[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hello,\n\nI have set up a JNDI datasource in accordance with the instructions given in \nthe JNDI Datasource HOWTO, and it works. However, the passwords in all the \nsample \"ResourceParams\" blocks are in plaintext (i.e. unencrypted) which could \ncreate a security issue. I can't seem to find anything in the Tomcat 4 docs \nthat explains how to encrypt the password field.\n\nAre there any plans to add encryption to the server.xml file to protect \npassword information? Or is there an undocumented way of doing this?\n\nThank you,\nVikram Ravindran\nInfor, Inc.", "is_private": false, "id": 111833, "creator": "vikram.ravindran@infor.com", "time": "2007-12-17T11:21:06Z", "bug_id": 44085, "creation_time": "2007-12-17T11:21:06Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44085, "is_private": false, "text": "This is regularly discussed on the users list.", "id": 111834, "time": "2007-12-17T11:28:36Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-12-17T11:28:36Z", "attachment_id": null}]
