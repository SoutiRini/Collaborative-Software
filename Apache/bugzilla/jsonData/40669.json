The functions further in\nthat seem to do a bit of the actual work, do allow for a refpath. However, this\nis null coming into the function (DefaultSiteTree:216). From SiteTree's javadocs\nit defines refpath as: path of the node, before which the new node will be inserted.\n\nHowever, in live there is no guarantee that the node defined in refpath would\nhave to exist.
