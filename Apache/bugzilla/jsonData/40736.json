We have made use of \nlog4j to perform logging for our application.  We are able to perform the log \nrotation by specifying the below permission in the server.policy\n// Permissions to delete the log file for rotation purpose\ngrant {\n    permission \njava.io.FilePermission \"${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/nodeagents/vs03/anserver2/lo\ngs/an/MARS.log.4\",\"delete\";\n};\n\nHowever, the above permissions is not correct because i am hard coding the \nnumber of rotation.  If i changed my permission to the one below.  The log4j \ncannot delete the last log and the exception is permission denied\n// Permissions to delete the log file for rotation purpose\ngrant {\n    permission \njava.io.FilePermission \"${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/nodeagents/vs03/anserver2/lo\ngs/an/-\",\"delete\";\n}\n\nor \n\ni have also tried this permission\ngrant {\n    permission \njava.io.FilePermission \"directory${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/nodeagents/vs03/ans\nerver2/logs/an/-\",\"delete\";\n};", "id": 94747, "time": "2006-10-11T19:51:08Z", "creator": "skteo72@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-11T19:51:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Have you tried one of the following:\n\n.../an/*\",\"delete\";\n.../an/<<ALL FILES>>\",\"delete\";", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 40736, "id": 95706, "time": "2006-11-11T17:13:32Z", "creator": "kay.abendroth@raxion.net", "creation_time": "2006-11-11T17:13:32Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "grobmeier@gmail.com", "text": "looks like the problem has been identified and/or is not related to log4j.
