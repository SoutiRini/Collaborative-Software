I could say that it is just to have a better manifest... ;) but \nactually, we need this (in my company) to specify dependencies in to oro in our \napps with the Extension-List mechanism. For instance Tomcat does not consider \nthat a dependency is resolved if the \"extension\" we depend on does not specify \nthis entry. \n \nThank you for your help.

I don't think most of us at Jakarta were aware that this was becoming\nan issue.  We've updated the packaging instructions at \n  http://jakarta.apache.org/site/packageversioning.html\nto include Implementaton-Vendor-Id.  It would seem we should have been doing\nthis since J2SE 1.3.\n\nThe change I made to oro is in the main trunk.  If you haven't already\nmanually fixed the manifest for your purposes, you can either build the\nlatest version of the source from:\n  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/oro/trunk/\nor rebuild the 2.0.8 source using the current:\n  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/oro/trunk/build.properties\n  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/oro/trunk/build.xml\n\nI don't think the change is significant enough to merit a 2.0.9 release\n(it would be 2.0.8 with just build.properties and build.xml changed).\nBut if there is some reason why it's necessary, I can call for a\nrelease vote.  Further discussion should happen on the oro-dev mailing\nlist (no use cluttering this issue report).", "id": 83708, "time": "2005-12-15T20:52:34Z", "creator": "dfs@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-12-15T20:52:34Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
