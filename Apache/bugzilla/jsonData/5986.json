Since these configuration files are meant to be edited by the \ndeployer on his/her tomcat instance, I cannot afford to put them in the jar of \nmy application, though I can pack a template of them in the war file. For \nexample let us say I have a DBConnectionPool class packed as a jar which has a \nproperty file which give the options of Driver/user/password that is supposed \nto be edited by the user using my war file. Since the lib directory in WEB-INF \ntakes only jar files and puts them in the CLASSPATH, I am now forced to create \na jar file of the property file. Also the user of my war file will have to \nunjar the jar to edit the property file and pack it back as a jar.\nb) The lib directory of WEB-INF understands only files which have a jar \nextension. It could not understand the JDBC driver file from \noracle 'classes12.zip' , even though it is a jar file with a different \nextension.", "id": 9810, "time": "2002-01-23T18:49:51Z", "creator": "vivek.vasudeva@bankofamerica.com", "creation_time": "2002-01-23T18:49:51Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5986, "text": "a) You can use the 'classes' folder to do that.
