[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "igor.antolovic.ext@siemens.com", "text": "Hi,\n\nwhen installing an new Apache version (2.4.7) on Our Solaris 10 platform, we are faced with an issue of unsupported OpenSSL version. \n\nApache 2.4.7 requires OpenSSL version higher than 0.97, ant throws an exception during integration.\n\nI have checked changes made in the new version and found the following note:\n\n  *) mod_ssl, configure: Require OpenSSL 0.9.8a or later. [Kaspar Brand]\n\n\nThe problem is that Solaris 10 does not support OpenSSL versions higher than 0.97 (information received directly from Oracle), and therefor we can not integrate the new version.\n\nIs there any workaround for this issue?\nWhat what is the reason for mandatory using of OpenSSL versions higher than 0.97?\nWhat would be the ramifications of patching the code of Apache 2.4.7 so it allows 0.97 version of OpenSSL to be used?\n\nBR\nIgor", "id": 172727, "time": "2014-01-28T10:44:01Z", "bug_id": 56072, "creation_time": "2014-01-28T10:44:01Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56072, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please see the discussion at\n\nhttp://markmail.org/thread/c6tcuf5w7xahvj4g\n\nConcerning Solaris: OpenSSL is part of the sfw additions and not linked into any system library. So if you need to run Apache httpd 2.4 on top of Solaris 10 (Solaris 11 is at OpenSSL 1.0.0), then just compile OpenSSL recent before and install it to a custom place. You can tell httpd where to find your OpenSSL during the Apache build procedure.\n\nDropping support for OpenSSL 0.9.7 was done in http://svn.apache.org/r1527294 as a prerequisite step for http://svn.apache.org/r1527295. Both were backported to 2.4 as part of http://svn.apache.org/r1542327.\n\nRegards,\n\nRainer", "id": 172729, "time": "2014-01-28T12:05:01Z", "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2014-01-28T12:05:01Z", "is_private": false}]
