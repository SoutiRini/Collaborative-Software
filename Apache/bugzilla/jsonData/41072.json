I have been working with tomcat from last 5 months. I have \n\\\ndeveloped this support(http CONNECT method) and using in my \"Post graduation \nProject \\\nwork\" its a \"Remote Desktop Management project\"  and which is working fine.   \n        Now i would like you guys to confirm that 'am i doing right'?.\n    \n       Implementation details :-\n       \n       Inside coyote package, we have class called HttpProcessor.class.
