But it does not allow \nServer to be set - it looks mostly like an oversight, not a deliberate omission.\n\nSubtags have proven to be extremely useful due to the nature of runtime \nevaluated custom tag attributes. Such attributes may contain only java and not \nfurther custom tags. For example, the following is not possible:\n\n<mt:mail from=\"<mytags:something/>\".....etc\n\nHowever this may be achieved using subtags:\n\n<mt:mail>\n  <mt:from><mytags:something/></mt:from>\n...\n\nSo to summarize: Please make a tag which allows the Server to be specified.
