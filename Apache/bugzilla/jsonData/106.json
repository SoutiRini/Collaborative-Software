The only reason I can see why that method is synchronized in the first place is to prevent duplicate loads of the same ResourceBundle (which would later be garbagecollected anyway...). Therefore either\r\n\r\na) remove the synchronization of StringManager.getManager()\r\nb) pass the manager around within the package\r\n\r\nPlease note that this method is called MANY times by each thread when writing the reponse."}]
