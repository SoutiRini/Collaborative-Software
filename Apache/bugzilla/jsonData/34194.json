When we are reading from a\nzipfile using ziptask it was taking 5 minutes to scan for the files.\n\nEventually I tracked it down.  ZipScanner extends DirectoryScanner.  ZipScanner\noverrides getIncludedFiles and getIncludedDirectories so it works perfectly.\n\nBut it does not override scan().  So this get's passed to DirectoryScanner who\ndoes a complete scan (even though it is impossible to get these results).\n\nSo this is needless slowing down everyones ant builds.\n\nI fixed mine by adding:\n\n    public void scan() throws IllegalStateException {\n        if (srcFile != null) {\n            //super.scan();\n            scanme();\n        } else {\n            super.scan();\n        }\n    }\n\nTo ZipScanner.\n\nMy operating platform is sun, though this probably affects everything."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 34194, "attachment_id": null, "id": 75550, "time": "2005-05-28T00:24:59Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-05-28T00:24:59Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is fixed in CVS HEAD."}]
