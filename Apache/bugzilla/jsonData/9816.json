However, if I \ntry to access the JSP programmatically, via HttpURLConnection, I get error 404 \n(as shown by the access logs).\n\nI know that there is a long standing bug in the 1.3 JDK related to \nHttpURLConnection (Java Bug #4160499), but the source of my problem is why \nTomcat 4 returns status code 404 for a well-formed URL request.\n\nWhen my program runs, it constructs a URL of the form:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/WebFoo/jsp/Folder1.jsp\n\nIn my Java test program, I display the parts of the URL using the methods: \nurl.getFile(), url.getHost(), etc. and it displays:\n\nURL Information for: http://localhost:8080/WebFoo/jsp/Folder1.jsp\nFile:     /WebFoo/jsp/Folder1.jsp\nHost:     localhost\nPort:     8080\nProtocol: http\nRef:      null\n\nHeader Information:\n[1]: Content-Type: text/html\n[2]: Date: Wed, 12 Jun 2002 20:01:46 GMT\n[3]: Server: Apache Tomcat/4.0.4-b3 (HTTP/1.1 Connector)\n[4]: Connection: close\nconn.getHeaderField(0) returns HTTP/1.1 404 /jsp/Folder1.jsp\nstatus code = 404\n\nAs you can see, the header fields seems to indicate that my web application \nname (\"WebFoo\") is lost somehow.\n\nThe Tomcat 4 access log file records the entry:\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [12/Jun/2002:15:50:08 -0500] \"GET /WebFoo/jsp/Folder1.jsp \nHTTP/1.1\" 404 627\n\nFinally, my web application is not listed in the server.xml file as an explicit \nContext. Is this required?  \n\nCan you help me to understand why I'm getting this 404 error code while things \nwork fine my (IE) browser?\n\nThanks,\nGlenn", "id": 17706, "time": "2002-06-12T20:10:51Z", "bug_id": 9816, "creation_time": "2002-06-12T20:10:51Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9816, "attachment_id": null, "id": 17708, "creation_time": "2002-06-12T21:03:29Z", "time": "2002-06-12T21:03:29Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "text": "This problem looks to me like a programming error.\nNote: It's a particularity of Japser to only return the relative URL in the 404\n(tested with Jasper 2, but Jasper 1 shouldn't be different).
