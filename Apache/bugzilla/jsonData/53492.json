Using two threads per core substantially improves throughput on my test machine, reducing the time it takes to build from 9 minutes to 2 minutes.\n\nThe attached patch adds a new -threadCount command-line argument to JspC, as well as a setThreadCount setter, suitable for use in an Ant task. It accepts a positive integer, or a core factor like \"2.0C\" which means two threads per core. 2.0C is the default.\n\nNote that on my machine it didn't help that much unless JspC was also configured to -compile the classes.\n\nI've attached a patch.", "id": 160376, "time": "2012-07-01T07:20:32Z", "creator": "dan@fabulich.com", "creation_time": "2012-07-01T07:20:32Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53492, "text": "Created attachment 29017\npatch\n\nBugzilla screwed up the mime type; trying again", "id": 160377, "time": "2012-07-01T07:21:16Z", "creator": "dan@fabulich.com", "creation_time": "2012-07-01T07:21:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 29017}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "dan@fabulich.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I'd love to have this backported to Tomcat 7 as well.
