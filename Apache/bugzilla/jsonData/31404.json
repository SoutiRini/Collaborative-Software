So you should first enter your Userid in the JIRA \nlogin panel and\nclick the \"Forgot Password\" link to get the password that JIRA has set for this \nnew account\ne-mailed to you. Otherwise you will need to create a JIRA account.\n\nTo find a migrated issue, including this one, the JIRA home page has a text \nfield\nin which you can enter the old Bugzilla number and go straight to the JIRA \nissue,\nfor XalanJ2 the issue keys are not numbers of are of the form XALANJ-#####   \nwhere ##### is a number, but not related to the old Bugzilla number.\n\nRegards,\nBrian Minchau"}]
