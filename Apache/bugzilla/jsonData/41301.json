The current ClassParser \nconstructors are presuming that the location of the class as a file is known \nwhen it is called which is not always the case. Using a class loaded thru a \nstandard class loader would avoid this dependency.\n\nCheers\n\nFA", "id": 97691, "time": "2007-01-05T06:45:57Z", "creator": "francis.andre@easynet.fr", "creation_time": "2007-01-05T06:45:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41301, "attachment_id": null, "id": 100254, "time": "2007-03-10T07:33:09Z", "creator": "tcurdt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-03-10T07:33:09Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please provide a patch for trunk."}, {"count": 2, "text": "no feedback provided", "bug_id": 41301, "attachment_id": null, "id": 113386, "time": "2008-02-02T13:20:27Z", "creator": "tcurdt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-02-02T13:20:27Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
