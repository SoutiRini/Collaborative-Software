In local network all works fine but when I tried to deloy to remote \nserver (outside our firewall) I have caught an IOException:\n\n\"Host attempting data connection xxx.xxx.xxx.xx2 is not same as server \nxxx.xxx.xxx.xx1\"\n\nwhere xxx.xxx.xxx.xx2 is IP of our firewall and xxx.xxx.xxx.xx1 IP of remote \nserver. Setproxy didn't help at all...\n\nIn Google Groups I have found solution for our problem: \nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?\nhl=ru&lr=&threadm=pan.2005.05.11.07.52.37.118599%\n40libero.it&rnum=1&prev=/groups%3Fq%3D%2522is%2Bnot%2Bsame%2Bas%2Bserver%2522%\n2Bcommons%26hl%3Dru%26lr%3D%26selm%3Dpan.2005.05.11.07.52.37.118599%\n2540libero.it%26rnum%3D1\nTo apply this solution I have to setRemoteVerificationEnabled(false). But this \nproperty still not changeble from Ant and what is more this problem exists in \nAnt some years (look here: http://www.mail-archive.com/ant-\nuser@jakarta.apache.org/msg20460.html - the same problem without solution from \n2002 year). But this is rare problem: only 5 questions in Google: \nhttp://www.google.com/search?ie=windows-1251&q=%\n22Host+attempting+data+connection%22++%22is+not+same+as+server%22\nThat's why no solution till now.\n\nSo. To resolve this problem I have add remoteVerificationEnabled attribute to \nFTP task (see attached diff file). And now ftp works perfectly behind firewall. \nI think this attribute will be very useful for everybody. Please, add this \nattribute to next version of Ant.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n-- \nViacheslav Garmash\nTeam Leader\nExadel Inc.\ne-mail: vgarmash@exadel.com\nphone       +375 17 2626260 ext. 106\ncellular    +375 29 4038657"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "vgarmash@exadel.com", "text": "Created attachment 15515\nexample of code to insert", "id": 76613, "time": "2005-06-22T18:25:43Z", "bug_id": 35471, "creation_time": "2005-06-22T18:25:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 15515}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35471, "attachment_id": 15516, "text": "Created attachment 15516\nJar from Eclipse Ant plugin that contain patched FTP class", "id": 76615, "time": "2005-06-22T18:32:16Z", "creator": "vgarmash@exadel.com", "creation_time": "2005-06-22T18:32:16Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "vgarmash@exadel.com", "text": "Created attachment 15517\nInstruction for Eclipse users", "id": 76616, "time": "2005-06-22T18:33:02Z", "bug_id": 35471, "creation_time": "2005-06-22T18:33:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 15517}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35471, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This is easy enhancement.
