The main benefit is better comments and self-documenting arguments to the common worker methods, which should be helpful to anyone investigating tomcat authentication behaviour but who does not have a detailed understanding of its internal logic.\n\nThe motive and techniques used here bring the source into line with an earlier enhancement to the TestNonLoginAndBasicAuthenticator, i.e. https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54190#c4\n\nAll tests should pass with the latest trunk.
