That was necessary to maintain\nvisitor language information.\n\nThis code is available at:\nhttp://lenya.apache.org/1_2_x/how-to/search.html\nThe original, and comments about using on Linux are at:\nhttp://solprovider.com/lenya/search\n\nWhile the crawler is good if you want to index non-Lenya websites, it\nis poor design for Lenya.  It feels like someone got lazy and used the\nDefaultIndexer for HTML rather than use the ConfigurableIndexer for\ntrue integration with Lenya, or maybe there are historical reasons\nsuch as the ConfigurableIndexer not being available when Lucene was\nfirst integrated.  I expect the website crawler to disappear, rather\nthan be a priority improvement.\n\nMy project is moving into production.  Incremental indexing and\nintegration with the CMS GUI are priorities.  I want the index to be\nupdated x minutes after updates are completed, delaying if another\nsave happens before it starts.  The indexer needs to be started from a\nscheduler.  I need to integrate with the scheduler, and from the\nnumber of issues about the scheduler in the mailing lists, may need to\nrevise it.", "bug_id": 33702, "attachment_id": null, "id": 75780, "time": "2005-06-02T04:51:30Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-06-02T04:51:30Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33702, "attachment_id": null, "text": "added as a feature for the lenya3 version : http://wiki.apache.org/lenya/Lenya 3.0", "id": 138561, "time": "2010-07-20T09:18:57Z", "creator": "florent.andre-dev@4sengines.com", "creation_time": "2010-07-20T09:18:57Z", "is_private": false}]
