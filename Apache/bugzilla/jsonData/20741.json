[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20741, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Currently, the Clearcase checkin/checkout tasks can only be used on a single file or directory, specified using a viewpath attribute.  It would be nice if I could specify a fileset instead, and the checkin/checkout command execute automatically on all the files in the fileset.  This would be particularly useful since Clearcase's cleartool command doesn't have any -recursive option; if the task supported a fileset I could just specify includes=\"**/*.java\" in the build.xml instead.\n\nAlso, I notice in the javadoc comments of the org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.clearcase.ClearCase class, it says \"The class extends the 'exec' task\", yet so far as I can see it doesn't - the class only extends Task, not ExecTask, and doesn't make any use of the extra features (e.g. a timeout watchdog in case the command hangs) that the ExecTask offers.  Perhaps it should be refactored so that it does?", "id": 38792, "time": "2003-06-13T11:11:14Z", "creator": "ats37@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-13T11:11:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20741, "attachment_id": null, "text": "this seems to be duplicate of http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3310", "id": 54221, "time": "2004-03-18T13:38:58Z", "creator": "kgurakjqwjoye@mailinator.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-18T13:38:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20741, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 3310 ***", "id": 72244, "time": "2005-03-11T22:44:36Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-11T22:44:36Z", "is_private": false}]
