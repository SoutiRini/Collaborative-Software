To address this, the EL evaluation machinery can be\ndeactivated as indicated in this section.\n[...]\nThe default mode for JSP pages in a Web Application delivered using a web.xml\nusing the Servlet 2.3 or earlier format is to ignore EL expressions; this\nprovides for backward compatibility.\n---\n\nHowever, even with deactivated EL expression evaluation, jsp code like:\n<%@ page isELIgnored=\"true\" %>${<%= \"Hello, world!\" %>}\n\nwill produce output like:\n${<%= \"Hello, world!\" %>}\n\nwhich is of course not backwards-compatible with Servlet 2.3 / JSP 1.2 container\n(e.g., Tomcat 4.x), where the output would be:\n${Hello, world!}\n\nThe ${...} syntax is widely used, and any pre-2.0 jsp pages having it would be\nincompatible with Tomcat 5.x even though the standard tries to ensure the\ncompatibility.", "id": 80766, "time": "2005-10-05T01:08:53Z", "bug_id": 36923, "creation_time": "2005-10-05T01:08:53Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This bug has been fixed in trunk and proposed for 6.0.x\n\nFixing it in Tomcat 5 will require the back-porting of the isELIgnored work form Tomcat 6.
