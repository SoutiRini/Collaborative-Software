[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23758, "text": "This is a request to reconsider the way <fileset> works.  I would like to \nspecify the files belonging to the set as only those contained in an include \nfile.  There is no way to specify this.\n\nThe required syntax is as follows:\n\n    <delete>\n        <fileset dir=\"path-of-files\" includesfile=\"include-file\" />\n    </delete>\n\nThis only works if I know and can specify the directory of the files that are \nbeing deleted.  Otherwise the delete fails and Ant goes on to the next task.  \nThis doesn't allow me to specify the paths in the include file (which in my \ncase is generated by an outside script).", "id": 45458, "time": "2003-10-13T01:38:09Z", "creator": "henrywcho@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2003-10-13T01:38:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23758, "attachment_id": null, "text": "See this bug with 1.5.4.", "id": 45459, "time": "2003-10-13T02:12:22Z", "creator": "henrywcho@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2003-10-13T02:12:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23758, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 18128 ***", "id": 45502, "time": "2003-10-13T13:32:15Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-10-13T13:32:15Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
