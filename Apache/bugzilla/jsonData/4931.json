There might be multiple \nreasonable interpretations of a relative DTD\npath, but from a developer's viewpoint there\nare some essential elements:\n\n1) It needs to be consistent regardless of \nwhere xerces.jar is loaded from\n2) It cannot require the developer to specify\na relative path that makes any assumption \nabout where Tomcat is installed or the name\nof the web app main directory (since these\nvary from install to install and are not\nunder developer control).\n\nCraig R.
