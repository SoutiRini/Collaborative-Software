Is there any \nprogress?  \n    I have a secure site with most content and forms available to anonymous \nusers, but a particular database app is for staff only, authenticated by X.509 \ncerts (.htaccess says \"SSLVerifyClient require\" and a test for our C.A.), and \nnaturally it's a POST form (to keep prolix and subpoena-able stuff out of the \naccess_log).  As a workaround, in ssl.conf at global level I changed \n\"SSLVerifyClient none\" to \"optional\", so if there were a cert it would be \npresented initially, not requiring renegotiation and trashing the POST data.  \nBut everyone gets asked for a cert, even though most content is still delivered \neven if they don't give it.  That's not the way it should work."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24725, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 47466, "time": "2003-11-17T03:27:12Z", "creator": "mads@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-11-17T03:27:12Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 18395 ***"}]
