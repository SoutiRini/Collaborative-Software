Missing such validity checking can sometimes cause hard-to-debug problem. Hope this can be fixed in the new release.\n\nThanks\n\n-Sai", "id": 177193, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 56861, "creation_time": "2014-08-15T20:39:52Z", "time": "2014-08-15T20:39:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 177213, "time": "2014-08-18T01:19:11Z", "bug_id": 56861, "creation_time": "2014-08-18T01:19:11Z", "text": "This would be extremely hard to implement in general, and would prevent users from adding their own property names."}]
