We're using JDBC connection inside JMeter. When I passed the query with parameters ( which are passed through random numbers ), each time the # of users increase, the average increases exponentially.\n\nFor example, for 1 user the average is 162 ms. However, for 5 users it was 620. For 10 users it was 1220 and for 25 it was 4590. \n\nI am very surprised that these values are increasing exponentially. According to me this \"Average\" should mean total.\n\nCan you help me on this?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.\nPlease ask your question on jmeter user mailing list\nYou will certainly get an answer.", "id": 164042, "time": "2012-12-12T22:46:30Z", "bug_id": 54286, "creation_time": "2012-12-12T22:46:30Z", "is_private": false}]
