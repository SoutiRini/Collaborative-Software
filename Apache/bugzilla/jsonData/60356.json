We have a nightly deploy and test. After this change the deployed server was working fine, but the test compilation of the tag library now fails.\n\nAttached is a cut-down test case that shows the issue. If you run\n\nant -Dtomcat.dir=PATH_TO_TOMCAT7\n\nyou will see the error:\nbuild.xml:38: org.apache.jasper.JasperException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /META-INF/tags/listitems.tagx\n\nIf you take the same war file and deploy it, you can view the welcome page and the tag works as expected.
