In Excel (2007) in the print dialog, the section 'Print what' has radio buttons with values 'Selection' and 'Active sheet(s)', suggesting that the 'active' sheet is used when that radio button is set.  From what I could tell, regardless of the value of the radio button, only the 'selected' sheet flags were taken into account.  \n\nI left the fix to include the update of 'active' sheet because it seemed wrong to let the workbook have no active sheet, and it does no harm for this bug or any other existing test case.  Perhaps the observed behaviour related to printing is just a bug in Excel 2007.\n", "id": 116717, "time": "2008-05-16T12:21:55Z", "creator": "josh@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-05-16T12:21:55Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
