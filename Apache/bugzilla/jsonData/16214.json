[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "When matching the string \"peter+n@bmtmicro.com\", the following regular \nexpression fails with RegExp 1.2.

However, to my \nbest knowledge, these expressions should all return the same result. This has \nbeen verified by using JavaScript which has regex support. In JavaScript all \nthree expressions evaluate true.\n\nThanks,\nPeter Nielsen\nBMT Micro, Inc.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 16214, "id": 29618, "time": "2003-01-17T16:30:16Z", "creator": "petern@bmtmicro.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-17T16:30:16Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16214, "attachment_id": null, "id": 36098, "time": "2003-04-25T13:26:45Z", "creator": "vgritsenko@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-25T13:26:45Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 14954 ***"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16214, "text": "Fixed by Bug #19329", "id": 36487, "time": "2003-05-02T01:14:36Z", "creator": "vgritsenko@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-05-02T01:14:36Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
