So -1 to implementing any kind of target-level continuation.  Maybe \nyou could revise this report with the specific tasks that are failing for you \nand those can be considered for optionally not failing (many tasks like \n<javac>, <junit>, etc - have failonerror attributes).\n\nAs for a flag on target failure, this gets a -1 also.  This is what a \nBuildListener is for - so you can write a custom one to receive a \ntargetFinished notification and check if it failed.
