However, we noticed that SessionDestroyed method is not called for all users after user session timeouts. We have placed a System.out.println in method to know for which users the event is getting called, but not all users listener is called. Unfortunately we do not have exact steps of replication because there is not pattern found for this issue.\n\nIs this a bug? Is thhis resolved with later release of tomcat.\n\nRegards\nBrijesh", "id": 139513, "time": "2010-08-27T03:56:52Z", "creator": "brijesh.walia@comit.ch", "creation_time": "2010-08-27T03:56:52Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49834, "is_private": false, "id": 139514, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-08-27T04:15:26Z", "time": "2010-08-27T04:15:26Z", "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
