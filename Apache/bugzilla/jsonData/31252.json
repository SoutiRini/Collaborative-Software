[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\nI'm using the xerces.jar for the XML parser. I got some kind of problem after I \ncheck this file into CVS. The following steps describe how the problem occurs:\n\n1. I check xerces.jar into CVS of version 1.12.9.\n2. I try to open this jar file with WinZip and I get \"1 byte is missing' error \nmessage and can't be opened. \n3. When I try to make the build, the compilation throws lots of exception due \nto this problem.\n4. If I rename this file to another file name and check it into the same CVS, I \ndon't get any problem.\n5. But, I can check in the same file into CVS version 1.11.2 without any \nproblem.\n\nAll of the files in xerces.jar are dated 11/15/2001.\n\nThanks!\n\nJenny", "is_private": false, "id": 63624, "creator": "jsobhani@alldata.net", "time": "2004-09-15T20:26:30Z", "bug_id": 31252, "creation_time": "2004-09-15T20:26:30Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 31252, "is_private": false, "id": 63627, "time": "2004-09-15T20:45:58Z", "creator": "ankitp@ca.ibm.com", "creation_time": "2004-09-15T20:45:58Z", "tags": [], "text": "This could be a problem with checking the file in as 'text' instead of 'binary'."}]
