The server was barely loaded\nand so the fact that the master process would die, but the child processes\nremained alive, was puzzling.  After I upgraded to 2.0.40 and moved on to other\nwork, the problem seemed to go away.  I tried switching back to 2.0.39 and\nleaving the server to run for long periods, or restarting it frequently, and\ncouldn't reproduce the problem.\n\nEventually, I realized that what I must have been doing was copying a newly\nrebuilt httpd binary into the installation directory while the server was\nrunning.  Changing the binary underneath a running server seems to cause the\nmaster process alone to exit.  Fair enough!  So although the submitter of this\nbug didn't respond, I wonder if that's what he or she was doing too.\n\nFor the record, I'm running on Solaris 8 with OpenSSL 0.9.6g, and the following\nconfiguration, compiled with Sun's WorkShop 6 update 2 C 5.3 compiler:\n\n./configure --prefix=/path/to/apache/wps-grader-2.0.40 \\\n        --with-layout=Apache \\\n        --with-port=8080 \\\n        --with-mpm=worker \\\n        --with-ssl=/path/to/openssl-0.9.6g \\\n        --enable-auth-digest \\\n        --enable-cgid \\\n        --enable-expires \\\n        --enable-headers \\\n        --enable-http \\\n        --enable-info \\\n        --enable-ssl \\\n        --enable-status \\\n        --enable-unique-id \\\n        --disable-cgi \\\n        --disable-dav \\\n        --disable-includes \\\n        --disable-proxy \\\n        --disable-userdir\nSummary is: If the submitter was copying new httpd executables into place\nwhile the server was running, that might explain his or her problems.\nMoral is: Don't do that."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 32254, "time": "2003-03-02T13:19:32Z", "bug_id": 10272, "creation_time": "2003-03-02T13:19:32Z", "text": "ehm, yes.
