The DisplayFilter\nassociates columns with regular expressions.  If the value in that column passes\nthe regexp, then the row is added to the display.  ColorFilters work the same\nway except they map columns and regular expressions to a Color.  For example,\ncolorFilter.addFilter(\"Level\", \"WARN|INFO\", Color.RED) will do the obvious.  If\na DisplayFilter exists, the row must pass at least one filter to be displayed. \nIf there are no display filters, all rows pass.\n\n---\n\nMaybe an XML file to configure chainsaw could include these settings?\n\n", "id": 31870, "time": "2003-02-24T16:23:58Z", "creator": "scott@schram.net", "creation_time": "2003-02-24T16:23:58Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 17341, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Chainsaw now displays different levels in different colors.", "id": 68293, "time": "2004-12-10T20:03:06Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2004-12-10T20:03:06Z", "is_private": false}]
