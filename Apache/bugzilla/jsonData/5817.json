Usage questions should go to the mailing list.\n\nTry playing with the parser option which controls entity reference expansion. In \ntheory you should be able to persuade the parser to build this as a DOM \nEntityReference node which in turn contains a text node containing the & \ncharacter. But not all parsers handle the builtin entity definitions the same \nway they do those created by the user, and a DOM builder _is_ allowed to flatten \nthese.\n\nActually, flattening may be what you want in any case.
