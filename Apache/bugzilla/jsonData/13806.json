If we move the mouse \ncursor on top of an element of the displayed SVG the tool tip come out without \nany problem unfortunately it does not go away after we move the mouse cursor \naway from the element.  The tool tip stayed on the screen after the SVG has \nbeen repainted. It just like a run away process or tread.
