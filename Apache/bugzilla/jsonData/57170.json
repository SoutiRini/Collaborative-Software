Now one of our customers is having some problems with these files. When he tries to open it with Microsoft Excel 2007, he gets a warning \"Sicherheitswarnung - Office-Datei\u00fcberpr\u00fcfung\" (see warning.png in zip-archive) and he has to click on \"\u00d6ffnen\" (open) each time he tries to open one of our excel-documents. I guess that this warning is like what is described in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584/de respectively http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584/en\n\nSo i created a simple demo file and tested it with the \"Microsoft Office File Validator\". The file failed the validation test. Also the \"Business Plan\"-Example (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/ss/examples/BusinessPlan.java) failed this validation test.\n\nThe output of BiffViewer was no help to me.\n\nCan You help me?\n\nYou will find all files (concerning the BusinessPlan-Example) in the attached ZIP-file.\n\nKind regards,\nAlexander Roskamp", "id": 178857, "time": "2014-10-31T09:47:38Z", "bug_id": 57170, "creation_time": "2014-10-31T09:47:38Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 32170}]
