[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3615, "text": "I am implementing a new filter for log4j. The documentation says that the \nmethods getOptionStrings() and setOption() are deprecated. This means they \nshould (must) not be used. If I do not implement the methods in my filter, I \nget an error message because the methods a part of the OptionHandler interface \nand they have to be implemented. If I do implement the methods, I get \ndeprecation warnings. I think this situation is unacceptable from the design \npoint of view and has to be resolved. \n\nI see 2 solutions:\n1) The Filter class supplies the dummy implementation of the methods that do \nnothing.\n2) The Filter class does not implement the OptionHandler interface at all. This \nsolution is preferable because there are no options anymore and filters are \ntreated as beans.", "count": 0, "id": 5550, "time": "2001-09-14T08:43:26Z", "creator": "andrei.mikhniak@stortext.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-14T08:43:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3615, "is_private": false, "text": "\nThis is fixed in the code in our repository.
