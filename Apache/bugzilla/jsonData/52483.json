JkOptions is only a little bit special, so if we are going to add more config info to the status worker, I think we should add most of these items there. That would make the page huge, so for the HTML page, it should be a separate page. I hesitate to do the work now. Not only the work in the status worker, but also in the Apache web server part of the module to make the config accessible from the more generic status worker.\n\nNot really difficult, but quite a bit of code and work. As always: patches welcome.\n\nI'm not closing as WONTFIX and I'm interessted in more comments on this enhancement request.\n\nSee also BZ 49063.\n\nI will ponder how to implment the logging part though (on debug log level).
