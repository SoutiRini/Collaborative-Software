The checkout\noperation will fail with an unhelpful error message if either locked or unlocked\nis true and a label is specified for the checkout.  \n\nThis is mandated by the StarTeam API, and logical, the point being that you\ncan't check a file out from any configuration other than the current label and\naffect the lock status in any way.  The only way you can check out from a label\nis to leave the lock status of each file unchanged.  In terms of the Ant\nstcheckout task the way to leave lock status alone is for BOTH \"locked\" and\n\"unlocked\" to be false.  This is the default, and is documented, but the\nrelationship of this to the labeled checkout is not documented.  It should be\ndocumented and an informative error message should be printed if the user makes\nthis mistake.  Even though I wrote the task, I suffered for many months with\nthis until I had the time to gain an understanding of it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22829, "attachment_id": 8017, "id": 43533, "time": "2003-09-01T03:53:58Z", "creator": "scohen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-09-01T03:53:58Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 8017\nimproved documentation and error message per bug description"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22829, "is_private": false, "id": 43542, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-09-01T09:56:43Z", "time": "2003-09-01T09:56:43Z", "text": "fixed with nightly build 2003-09-02.
