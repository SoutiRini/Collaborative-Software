There were \nno errors in the log files.  I restarted apache using \"apachectl restart\" and \nthe text went away.  Today I noticed the \"MaxSpareServers\" word from the \nhttpd.conf file in my server-status screen. I have not restarted apache since \nyesterday.  Again there are no errors in the logs.
