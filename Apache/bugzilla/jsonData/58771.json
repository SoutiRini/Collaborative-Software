The misconception is similar to mod-proxy when people don't know about ProxyErrorOverride. I added a section to mod-fcgid's documentation to improve the docs.\n\nTo test that my changes were good, I did:\n\n1) svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_fcgid/trunk mod_fcgid\n2) modified the documentation\n3) copied the files to the httpd-trunk repository to leverage the build docs scripts\n4) built the docs and ran validate-xhtml/validate-xml\n5) checked on my browser\n\nLet me know if you like the idea or if I wrote something terribly wrong (in case I'll amend my patch with the best answer).\n\nThanks!\n\nLuca"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "toscano.luca@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 33428, "text": "Created attachment 33428\nAdded directive tags as suggested by rbowen", "id": 187572, "time": "2016-01-12T16:33:34Z", "bug_id": 58771, "creation_time": "2016-01-12T16:33:34Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "rbowen@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks.
