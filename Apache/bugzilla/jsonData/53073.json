If there are less variable names than OUT parameters only as many results shall be stored in the thread-context variables as variable names were supplied. If more variable names than OUT parameters exist, the additional variables will be ignored. As such, I am making assumptions about the sequence and the number of variable names provided. Looking at the code that is used for storing results of a SELECT statement, this seems to be the case here as well.\n\nI checked the code once more (and also tested it in our environment) and it seems to be doing what above description intends."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for clarification and patch.\nPatch applied.", "is_private": false, "id": 158368, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2012-04-24T11:36:16Z", "bug_id": 53073, "creation_time": "2012-04-24T11:36:16Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53073, "text": "Date: Tue Apr 24 11:35:34 2012\nNew Revision: 1329645\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1329645&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 53073 - Allow to assign the OUT result of a JDBC CALLABLE to JMeter variables\n\nModified:\n   jmeter/trunk/src/protocol/jdbc/org/apache/jmeter/protocol/jdbc/AbstractJDBCTestElement.java\n   jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n   jmeter/trunk/xdocs/usermanual/component_reference.xml", "id": 158369, "time": "2012-04-24T11:36:50Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-04-24T11:36:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
