(http://xml.apache.org/fop/servlets.html).  This appears to a question\nbetter placed on FOP-USER.  IIRC the Xalan project has a sample Xalan Applet\nthat can possibly/probably be customized to use FOP--but we don't get many\nrequests at all for that.\n\nAs for Jetspeed, we don't do anything with that product--like Cocoon, they\ninterface with us, not vice-versa.  If you're having problems getting Jetspeed\nto work with FOP--that is something to ask on their user lists, and, if Jetspeed\ndoes not support FOP, then either switch to a product that does or enter an\nenhancement request *on Jetspeed* to get their product to support FOP.  As long\nas FOP works in a Java application, our part of the job is done--we don't code\nfor our \"consumer\" applications, they code for us.\n   \nxerces <-- xalan  <-- fop  <-- cocoon, jetspeed(?)\n\nThanks,\nGlen", "id": 57929, "time": "2004-05-23T18:30:00Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-05-23T18:30:00Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs", "id": 156613, "time": "2012-04-01T13:50:32Z", "bug_id": 27150, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:50:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
