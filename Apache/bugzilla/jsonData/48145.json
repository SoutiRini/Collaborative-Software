As a initial step, here are the files\nwhich will work standalone on a JVM and collect the DTrace details.\n\na) Copy the attached files into one directory\n\nb) Make sure the current directory and the jar file\n/usr/share/lib/java/dtrace.jar are in the class path. The jar file will be\navailable only after OpenSolaris Build 34, but can be installed by the users\nfor the other builds\n\nc) The methods to be monitored are to be provided with the file input.txt in\nthe form package,class,method\n\nd) Make sure to login with the same userid with which the process was started\n\ne) compile the MethodProfiler.java using javac MethodProfiler.java\n\nf) run \"java MethodProfiler <pid of the jvm>\"\n\n\n\nThe output will contain the DTrace output. But the average_time, max time and\ndistribution can be identified out of the output with little bit of difficulty.\n\nIt will work only on applications running in JVM 1.6 and above\n\nThanks,\nGokul."}]
