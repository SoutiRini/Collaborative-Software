This directory is copied to the output directory by the \"build-manifests\" target.\nIn the Git repository there is no such directory - https://github.com/apache/tomcat/tree/trunk/res/META-INF\nThat's because you cannot add an empty folder to the Git repository. If you really want an empty directory then you should add .gitignore file in it. http://www.dotkam.com/2010/08/21/making-git-to-add-empty-directories/\n\nRegards\nVioleta Georgieva"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks for the report.", "id": 163861, "time": "2012-12-04T22:08:42Z", "bug_id": 54245, "creation_time": "2012-12-04T22:08:42Z", "is_private": false}]
