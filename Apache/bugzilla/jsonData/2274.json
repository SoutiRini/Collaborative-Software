This behaviour depends on the compiler you are using. \n\nFor example the release notes for JDK 1.3 tell us: \n\n\"When the new 1.3 compiler detects an error in a source file during a \ncompilation, it continues to parse the remaining source files and attempts to \nidentify any further errors that they may contain. Code generation is \ncompletely suppressed for the remainder of the compilation, however, and no \nclass files will be generated, even for compilation units that contain no \nerrors. The old compiler in 1.2 would generate class files for any compilation \nunits that did not contain errors. This resulted in less redundant work during \nthe repeated compilations required to identify and correct all errors in a \nlarge program containing many files with errors. We hope to improve this \nbehavior in the future. The new compiler is substantially faster overall, \nhowever, which should tend to offset this somewhat. \""}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "It compiles if you use jikes or any other compiler than the \"modern\" one from \nJDK 1.3.\n\nThis is a known and documented limitation of the new compiler.", "id": 3951, "time": "2001-07-24T01:29:43Z", "bug_id": 2274, "creation_time": "2001-07-24T01:29:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
