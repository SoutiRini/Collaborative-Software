Tuxedo 8.1 is used as a TP \nMonitor. \nWe have written a few CGI scrips and a few modules that invoke Tuxedo \ncalls.\nWe are facing a problem when we use Apache 2. When invoking a tuxedo \ninitialization API call, it fails. But the same CGI andmodule works with \nApache 1.3 with Tuxedo 8.1.\n \nWe feel this might be due to some configuration change needed for \nApache 2.052.\nCould you please let us know how we could resolve this issue?\n \nThanks,\nNilima", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 31865, "id": 65600, "time": "2004-10-23T17:44:11Z", "creator": "nilimajain2004@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-10-23T17:44:11Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 65601, "time": "2004-10-23T18:37:52Z", "bug_id": 31865, "creation_time": "2004-10-23T18:37:52Z", "text": "There's nothing in this I can parse as a bug report.
