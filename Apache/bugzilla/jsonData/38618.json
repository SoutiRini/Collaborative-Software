I modified your patch just a little to fix some Checkstyle issues\nand to handle the \"FIXME\" you had in the patch. I also added your FO file as a\ntest case to the repo.\n\nNew files normally require that you have an CLA [1] on file with the ASF, but\nsince the addition was such a trivial class I consider it subject to chapter 5\nin the ALv2 like the rest of the patch. I hope that was only the first of your\npatches. If you start doing bigger changes I would like you to submit an CLA [1]\nto the ASF. If you have any questions about that, please ask.\n\n[1] http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas\n\nSo, patch applied.
