[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "apache_bugzilla@mindcontrolled.nl", "text": "mod_logio currently adds two logging directives: %I for bytes received (in) and %O for bytes sent (out). They are very handy in several situations. However, many packages that help the user translate the access logs into statistics, only provide for a single 'byte counter' when reading access_log, as by popular and accepted log formats.\n\nBefore mod_logio was available this counter was usually used to count %b, which doesn't include received bytes, and is inaccurate on partial downloads (it implies '100 MB sent' when a 100 MB file download is cancelled after 5 MB for example).\n\nIt seems that some distributions (at least Ubuntu) now include %O instead of %b to accurately record true sent bytes, but this still completely leaves out received bytes.\n\nI would like to suggest adding a logging directive that has the cumulative result of %I and %O so that:\n- sent and received data can be measured with the currently available packages for statistics;\n- this data can be recorded with those tools, without adding extra columns/data to the already available and well accepted log formats.", "id": 162786, "time": "2012-10-16T19:35:57Z", "bug_id": 54015, "creation_time": "2012-10-16T19:35:57Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54015, "text": "I forgot: wasn't sure what version I should put this on.
