Once it hangs any other Perl script that uses a system call will hang leaving both 'cmd' and 'perl' process hung in memory.  And any other Perl script that doesn't have a system call will execute, return the data, but the 'perl' process will stay resident in memory.  Eventually if enough cmd and/or perl processes remain in memory the system CPU pegs at 100% or Apache completely locks up requiring a system reboot.\n\nA: No log or error messages are created\nB: Sometimes it goes 10 days without a hang or just two days, and sometimes scripts with system/exec calls will run fine 100 times, and then just 5 times, before hanging.\nC: After a hang, a sevice restart usually works to get everything working again. But occassionally a full system reboot is required.\n\nThe above link to the PHP article refers to a similar problem with PHPs 'exec' system calls causing Apache to hang.\n\nPS: My apologies if this is already a documented issue, I searched bugzilla and found nothing similar in nature to what I (and the PHP users) are experiencing.", "id": 124489, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 46629, "creation_time": "2009-01-29T10:46:15Z", "time": "2009-01-29T10:46:15Z", "is_private": false}]
