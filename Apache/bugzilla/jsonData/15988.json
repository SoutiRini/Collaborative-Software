[{"count": 0, "text": "I'm finding that I write lots of things like this to achieve an if-else \nproperty setting structure with the condition task:\n\n<condition property=\"myProp\" value=\"value1\">\n  some condition...\n</condition>\n<condition property=\"myProp\" value=\"value2\">\n  <not>some condition...</not>\n</condition>\n\nYou can see that I want to set a property to one thing if a certain condition \nholds, and to another otherwise.  I am proposing a new attribute for the \ncondition task called 'otherwise' which is optional and sets the property to a \nsecond value if the condition is not met.  For example:\n\n<condition property=\"myProp\" value=\"value1\" otherwise=\"value2\">\n  some condition...\n</condition>", "bug_id": 15988, "attachment_id": null, "id": 29176, "time": "2003-01-11T06:41:06Z", "creator": "shawn@pobox.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-11T06:41:06Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "*** Bug 15987 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "bug_id": 15988, "is_private": false, "id": 29178, "time": "2003-01-11T06:42:02Z", "creator": "shawn@pobox.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-11T06:42:02Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15988, "attachment_id": null, "id": 29183, "time": "2003-01-11T10:36:31Z", "creator": "jakarta@ehatchersolutions.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-11T10:36:31Z", "is_private": false, "text": "How about this:   <condition property=\"myProp\">       some condition....   </condition>   <property name=\"myProp\" value=\"value2\"/>This takes advantage of property immutability, so that if it was set by the condition the <property> is ignored, but set otherwise.
