This situation occurs when the second extension isn't recognized from the server (e.g. \".aaa\", \".rb\", etc).\n  It occurs also with the \".phtml\" and \".php3\" files since the same module is used.\n\n  I hope that you can solve it bearing in mind that many systems aren't prevent with this.\n\n  Thanks.", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44963, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 116431, "time": "2008-05-09T12:45:28Z", "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "creation_time": "2008-05-09T12:45:28Z", "text": "This is normal, and is a matter of how you configure it.
