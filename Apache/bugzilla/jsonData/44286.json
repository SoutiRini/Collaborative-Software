The fix itself definitely looks good (using parameters instead of \nmember references to avoid the leak), but the applied re-styling of the code is less appreciated.\nNothing big. I'm just referring to the tab-characters and some swallowed linefeeds...

That would be much appreciated!\n\nAgain: thanks for the vigilance, and keep them coming. :-)\n"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44286, "attachment_id": null, "text": "OK, I guess you *did* mind. ;-)\nNo harm done, since it was only one file.\nModifications in the patch applied to the trunk.\n\nsee: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=615598&view=rev\n\nPlease take the remark about code-styling into account for any future patches (especially if they start \ninvolving changes to multiple source files...)\n\nThanks for the input!", "id": 113165, "time": "2008-01-27T05:39:35Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-01-27T05:39:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44286, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 156213, "time": "2012-04-01T07:05:12Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:05:12Z", "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed"}]
