And I'm sure you want to stick with your svn task as the sandbox antlib isn't really supported.\n\nThere must be a typedef somewhere in your build file that defines the svn task - and this typedef should give you a hint whom to tel about the bug.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't have any more clues to offer."}]
