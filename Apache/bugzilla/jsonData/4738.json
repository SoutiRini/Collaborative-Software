The previous version did work with \nMicrosoft VM, however the new one does not work  when the XML document contains:\n\"ISO-8859-1\".\n\nI don't know if this is meant to be so, or it is a bug.\n\nThe reason is that the previous version of Xerces converted \"ISO-8859-1\" \nto \"8859_1\" before calling new InputStreamReader(...)\n\nHowever the 1.4.3 version converts \"ISO-8859-1\" to \"ISO8859_1\" which is not \nworking on Microsoft's VM.\n\nthe conversion is made in class MIME2Java."}]
