This is equivalent to Ctrl+Down in Excel\n\nThe Sheet interface doesn't have a function to get the last row containing at least one non-blank cell.\n\nYou will need to iterate over the rows (ideally a reverse iterator) and iterate over cells in each row to determine if that row is blank, then return the row number of the last non-blank row. This sounds like it could be expensive.\n\nYou may want to look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38204944/apache-poi-check-if-a-column-is-empty/38238218#38238218 for ideas on efficient iteration.\n\nSince this is not a bug but a usage question, I.
