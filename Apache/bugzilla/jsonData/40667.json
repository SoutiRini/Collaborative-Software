I have a few comments.\n\n1. Your patch for src/java/org/apache/fop/layoutmgr/PageBreakingAlgorithm.java\nreads:\n\n     /** the logger for the class */\n     protected static Log classLog = LogFactory.getLog(PageBreakingAlgorithm.class);\n \n+    /** the logger for the instance */\n+    private static Log log = classLog;\n\nWhy don't you remove 'protected static Log classLog'?\n\nRe the comment, a static variable is for the class, not for the instance.\n\n2. In the LayoutManagers, there is a protected static Log instance in\norg.apache.fop.layoutmgr.AbstractBaseLayoutManager, assigned to class LayoutManager:\n\nprotected static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(LayoutManager.class)\n\nThis is used by all LayoutManagers. I can imagine that you find this too coarse,\nand prefer to see a different logger for each LayoutManager, but then it would\nbe better to do so for each LayoutManager.\n\nRegards, Simon\n"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40667, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi Simon,\n\nI prefer to touch others code in very kind matter, meaning that I'd like to \nsee as small recompiling as possible (in this case I wanted to touch just log \nmembers and not classLog I had no knowledge about).
