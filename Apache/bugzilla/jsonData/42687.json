[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "This bug report is a patch submission, sponsored by nCipher PLC, that provides\nthe minimal changes necessary to:\n\n 1. Break the PEM file habit.\n 2. Disable ssl_engine_pphrase password entry and (asn.1 based) caching of\ncertificates and keys read from those files. \n 3. Enable a pkcs11 based openssl ENGINE implementation to be used.\n\nThe change set introduced by this patch is *not* suitable for production use.\nIt's primary purpose is to stimulate discussion of if/how mod_ssl should be\nchanged to better support HSM managed keys and the pkcs11 standard.\n\nThis patch applies the above 3 changes if *any* SSLCryptoDevice is present in\nthe apache config. It assumes the same SSLCryptoDevice is used server wide. No\nattempt is made to support distinct SSLCryptoDevices on a per (IP) based virtual\nhost basis.\n\nSupport for 3 in this patch is limited: It requires that *either* -DONE_PROCESS\nis specified to apache on startup OR the pkcs11 implementation breaks the\n\"Applications and processes\" rules set out in the pkcs11 standard [p 17 PKCS #11\nv2.2 6.6.1]. A subsequent patch will lift the restrictions for the worker mpm.\n\nFor fuller discussion please see the http-dev thread \"Apache2 mod_ssl with HSM\nsupport\" (started on Tue, 29 May 2007). \nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200705.mbox/ajax/%3cB98CCF34D7B54844B011D9D9D6DDBEAD09B84D@gemtsv10.engy.local%3e\"", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42687, "id": 104489, "time": "2007-06-18T03:44:56Z", "creator": "rbryce@ncipher.com", "creation_time": "2007-06-18T03:44:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 20364\nMinimal support for (openssl) engine managed keys", "attachment_id": 20364, "bug_id": 42687, "id": 104490, "time": "2007-06-18T03:48:02Z", "creator": "rbryce@ncipher.com", "creation_time": "2007-06-18T03:48:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42687, "attachment_id": null, "text": "*** Bug 52473 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 171512, "time": "2013-11-30T08:28:37Z", "creator": "asfbugz@velox.ch", "creation_time": "2013-11-30T08:28:37Z", "is_private": false}]
