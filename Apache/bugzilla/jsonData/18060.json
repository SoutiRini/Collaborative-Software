I think a one-letter alias for it (similar to the -q/-v/-f/-l  \naliases for -quiet/-verbose/-buildfile/-logfile) would be extremely cool. I \nsuggest -?, since it's intuitive and it's not currently in use. Also, you \nmight as well make -h an alias for -help while you're at it.

Under UNIX, if a wildcard does not glob to anything, it is \npassed to exec as-is. So this means the only case where having a -? option \nwould not work is when the user has a file named \"-X\" in the current directory, \nwhere X is any character. I think this case is so obscure, it can basically be \nignored. I have personally never seen a file named \"-X\" in UNIX or Windows. It \nwould be extremely difficult to work with on UNIX (you'd have to pass \"--\" as \nthe first option to most commands).\n\nIf you want to be really robust, you could have Ant check for the existence \nof \"-X\" files in the cwd that have the same name as an option that was passed \nin, and handle it as follows:\n\n  o print a warning, ie \"WARNING: A file named -h exists in the current \ndirectory. The -h option will be ignored. \n  o ignore the -h option\n\nRegards,\nIan\n", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 18060, "id": 33304, "time": "2003-03-17T17:42:54Z", "creator": "ian_springer@hp.com", "creation_time": "2003-03-17T17:42:54Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18060, "is_private": false, "text": "On CVS-Head we introduced some abbreviations:\n-d  -->  -debug\n-e  -->  -emacs\n-h  -->  -help\n-p  -->  -projecthelp\n-s  -->  -find\n\nWe discussed more on the dev-list.
