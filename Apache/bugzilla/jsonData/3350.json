In the first case, it\nmay also be a parse error for the <jsp:text> to be omitted,\nunless this is considered part of an XML fragment by the spec.", "id": 5018, "time": "2001-08-29T15:20:59Z", "bug_id": 3350, "creation_time": "2001-08-29T15:20:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"text": "Fixed in nightly build 20010913.\n", "tags": [], "bug_id": 3350, "attachment_id": null, "count": 1, "id": 5435, "time": "2001-09-12T13:31:31Z", "creator": "craig.mcclanahan@sun.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-12T13:31:31Z", "is_private": false}]
