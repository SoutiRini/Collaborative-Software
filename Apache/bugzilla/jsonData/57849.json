I did the same changes but still I am facing same issue \n\nProxyPass /sgmgr https://localhost:1188/sgmgr retry=0\n\nBelow are my questions,\n\n1. Who is printing \u201cService Temp Unavailable\u201d message ? Is it possible to change the error message \u201cService Temp Unavailable\u201d to some other meaning full sentence so that user will not be confused with this error. Since this error is temporary, can we mention workaround like press F5\n\n2. Is there any other configuration property to avoid this error like retry=0. \n\n3. In general how we can avoid \"service temporarily unavailable\" issue \n\n4. Is there any new version of apache where this issue has been fixed\n\nThanks,\nSandeep", "id": 182584, "time": "2015-04-23T04:44:57Z", "creator": "hssandeep16@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-04-23T04:44:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 182596, "time": "2015-04-23T12:44:11Z", "bug_id": 57849, "creation_time": "2015-04-23T12:44:11Z", "text": "Bugzilla is for reporting bugs, not support.
