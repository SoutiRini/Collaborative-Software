[{"count": 0, "text": "Good day Apache,\n\nTrust you are well, we are currently utilizing apache version 2.4.20 (Windows Server 2003 OS) on our production environment as a load balancer, we have external users connecting via an open URL link which passes through an Palo Alto Firewall to the load balancer. The System we are using is Navis Sparcs N4 version 2.6.19 as our Terminal Operating System, the Apache Load Balancer fetches N4 connections from 5 Nodes configured on the Load Balancer. \n\nThe issue we are experiencing is that there are Concurrent Login Sessions (up to 188 logins in a second) at certain times of the day which impacts the CPU Usage of our Database (up to 97% CPU Usage), as a result the performance of our Navis TOS degrades and the Terminal users are affected to a point that the system cannot process transactions.  \n\nIs there a solution or fix in place that will not allow or block the Apache Load Balancer from fetching Concurrent Logins from the Navis Application. \n\nPlease feel free to contact or email me for further information. \n\nthank you \n\nShirgan", "bug_id": 60242, "attachment_id": null, "id": 194345, "time": "2016-10-12T06:24:56Z", "creator": "shirgan.parshotam@transnet.net", "creation_time": "2016-10-12T06:24:56Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 194368, "time": "2016-10-12T14:29:08Z", "bug_id": 60242, "creation_time": "2016-10-12T14:29:08Z", "text": "Bugzilla is for reporting bugs in the server, not for support or configuration assistance.
