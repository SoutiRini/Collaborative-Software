The session id contained in the cookie\n   is not recognized. A new one is created, which replaces the old one.\n4) user returns to application A. The session id contained in JSESSIONID cookie\n   is the id of a session on a proprietary web server, which obviously does not\n   correspond to any session on Tomcat. Thus, Tomcat is unable to retrieve the\n   user's session. Session is lost.\n\nIn some case, this problem can be fixed by setting the 'emptySessionPath'\nattribute to 'false' in Tomcat's server.xml. This will make all JSESSIONID \ncookies target '/context' path instead of '/', and hence preserve the values\nof the jessionid cookies. However, this attribute cannot be set to false in \nsome scenarios, e.g. when portals are used, which require that jsessionid\ncookies be transmitted across applications.\n\nSolution :\n----------\nA solution is to allow people to configure the name of the jsessionid cookie,\nfor all applications on a given server, or for a specific application.\nIn the depicted scenario, this prevents the application server 'B' to overwrite \nthe jsessionid cookie of the application 'A'.\n\nCurrently, changing the name of the jessionid cookie is not possible, as it is \nharcoded in the following source files (non-exhaustive list) :\n org/apache/catalina/connector/CoyoteAdapter.java (catalina.jar)\n org/apache/catalina/connector/Response.java (catalina.jar)\n org/apache/catalina/realm/RealmBase.java (catalina.jar)\n org/apache/jasper/tagplugins/jstl/Util.java (jasper-compiler.jar)\n native/common/jk_global.h (mod_jk.so)\n\nThis feature request applies (at least) to Catalina, Jasper and Native:JK."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42419, "is_private": false, "id": 103506, "time": "2007-05-22T09:37:11Z", "creator": "d.beutner@gmx.de", "creation_time": "2007-05-22T09:37:11Z", "tags": [], "text": "Beneath changing the cookie's name, additional options are to restrict the \ncookie to a certain domain and/or path.
