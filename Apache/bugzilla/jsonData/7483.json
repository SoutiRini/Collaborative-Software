[{"text": "Hi, I am a developer for Bugzilla and I am using your server to host my test\nBugzilla database http://bugzilla.netdemonz.com/ on Windows XP and have run into\na little problem. I want to use ScriptInterpreterSource Registry and have been\nusing it for a while. The main reason for this is I do not want to put all the\nshebang lines in on perl scripts. Its annoying as heck to do so. This was\nespecially useful for Bugzilla because I could leave the shebang lines as-is\n(for easy diffing). Unfortunately, Bugzilla added a -T to their shebang line.\nThe scripts for Bugzilla wouldn't run. The problem is that ActivePerl doesn't\nlet you have a -T in your shebang line when you have the File Association in the\nRegistry set to not include the -T option (mine only uses -w). I changed the\nRegistry to -wT, and then the other scripts I had missing the shebang line\nwouldn't run.\n\nAs a solution to this, I thought about tried this in the htaccess.accf\n(htaccess) I have in the Bugzilla directory:\nRemoveHandler .pl .cgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nAction cgi-script \t\"c:\\general\\web\\tools\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe -wT\"\n\nI also tried this:\nRemoveHandler .pl .cgi\nAddType application/x-cgi .cgi\nAction application/x-cgi \t\"c:\\general\\web\\tools\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe -wT\"\n\nUnfortuntaly, neither worked.\n\nIt would be nice to have a \"ScriptInterpreterSource handler cgi-script\" or\nsomething you could use in the httpd.conf and htacces file to do the similiar\nthing to what \"ScriptInterpreterSource registry\" does, except have Apache\nmaintain the association.", "tags": [], "creator": "netdemon@netdemonz.com", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 12338, "time": "2002-03-26T13:12:31Z", "bug_id": 7483, "creation_time": "2002-03-26T13:12:31Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "I can say with relative certainty that this feature won't be added in 1.3.\nI would also guess that this feature won't make it into 2.0 either, since\nit would mean adding some considerable complexity to handle a very special\ncase.  \n\nThere are several problems with your Action technique.
