You are welcome to get your hands dirty and\ncontribute a patch. Have a dig arround in the java\\org\\apache\\poi\\hssf\\record\narea and look for where the series for charts are specified. Alternatively I\nbelieve that Andy can provide you with paid support\n\nI suspect that the best approach is to keep the clone functionality \"as is\" but\nexpose a high level API to the chart in the new sheet to change its series. But\nthis would require alot of work.\n\nJason"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 26862 ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 169087, "creation_time": "2013-08-04T19:04:41Z", "time": "2013-08-04T19:04:41Z", "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "bug_id": 27075, "is_private": false}]
