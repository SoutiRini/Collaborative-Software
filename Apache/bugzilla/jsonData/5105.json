What a pitty, the last versions from tomcat do not \ninclude /webapps/*.war files!!! ;-).\n\n- Delete all the files and direcories recursively from /webapps/examples and \nfrom /work/localhost/examples (directories \"examples\" included).\n\n- In the server.xml file uncomment the Persistent Manager section from the \nTomcat Examples Context just to \"test Persistent Sessions\" and set the \nparameter saveOnRestart to \"true\".\n\n- Start tomcat and try to figure out what does tomcat do with the examples \nwebapp => the examples webapp does not exist: examples.war was not entpacked \ninto /webapps/examples!!\nSee your log file (localhost_examples_log.yyyy-mm-dd.txt):\n2001-11-28 10:45:05 StandardContext[/examples]: Error initializing resources: \nDocument base D:\\Programme\\JBuilder5\\tomcat\\webapps\\examples does not exist or \nis not a readable directory\n\n- And what happens when you type \nhttp://localhost:8080/examples/servlets/index.html in your browser?\n\n- If you are using tomcat with apache, try to figure out what does tomcat do \nwith the examples webapp when you type \nhttp://localhost/examples/servlets/index.html in your browser.\n\n- And now follow the steps described by James Cai:\na) delete the webapps and work directories for the examples webapp, comment out \nthe <context> config from examples and restart tomcat ==> examples.war will be \nentpacked into /webapps/examples!!. (The examples context is not valid -it was \ncommented out-).\nb) uncomment the <context> in server.xml and restart Tomcat again without \ndeleting any files (trees webapps/examples and work/localhost/examples) \npreviously ==> this time it DOES work only because the /webapps/examples tree \nwas previously created in (a).
