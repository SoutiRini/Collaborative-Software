I have debugged it down to the clear() method \ninside of CookieManager. This method removes all cookies from it's properties, \nincluding one's that are StoredCookies from the GUI, or from the config file.\n\nIf you do not check the 'Clear cookies from each iteration?' box, the \nStoredCookies will stay there, but if you check the box (which I would assume \n*would not* clear the stored ones), it removes all the StoredCookies.\n\n**HOWEVER**** -- none of this was able to be caught until I found a bug \ndealing with the Cookie Expiration. The logic to see if a cookie should be put \non the header (getCookieHeaderForURL()) checks to see if the expiration is \ngreater than currentTimeMillis()/1000. That is fine for cookies that are set \nby the browser, because they know what the current time is. But for \nStoredCookies that want to be memory resident, they should be able to set the \nexpiration time to '0' and have it work.\n\nSo, the quick fix for this is to change line 292 in CookieManager.java from (I \nwill sumbit a new bug for this):\n\n && (System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000) <= cookie.getExpires())\n\nto:\n && ((cookie.getExpires()==0)||(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000) <= \ncookie.getExpires()))\n\nThis will allow StoredCookies to be memory resident cookies, and not have to \nworry about expirations.\n\nHowever, the 'Clear cookies' bug still exists -- it clears all of the cookies, \nand not just browser set ones. I think the level of this bug should be \nincreased.\n"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25157, "text": "When using \"HTTP AUTHORIZAION MANAGER\" to log in.\nIt is suppose to send a cookie back, so I used the HTTP Cookie Manager.\nBut it doesnt work.\n\nI used the tree listener and I got this as a return result\n\nAccess Forbidden\nPlease Note: Access to this web site requires that cookies pass properly \nbetween your web browser and this web server.
