I suggest to add a checker like all the other module directives do. For example, LimitRequestLine, LimitRequestFieldsize, CacheMin/MaxFileSize, etc. I personally really like the idea of careful checking in Apache httpd.\n\nThe patch is really simple and tested.\n\nThanks,\nJackie", "count": 0, "id": 163910, "time": "2012-12-06T07:18:40Z", "bug_id": 54254, "creation_time": "2012-12-06T07:18:40Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks, committed as r1425777 (without the explanation of AsyncRequestWorkerFactor, which I think is too simplified).", "attachment_id": null, "id": 164236, "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "time": "2012-12-25T21:52:27Z", "bug_id": 54254, "creation_time": "2012-12-25T21:52:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Backported in 2.4.x in r1502204.\n\nIs part of 2.4.5", "attachment_id": null, "id": 180710, "creator": "christophe.jaillet@wanadoo.fr", "time": "2015-02-03T07:11:28Z", "bug_id": 54254, "creation_time": "2015-02-03T07:11:28Z", "is_private": false}]
