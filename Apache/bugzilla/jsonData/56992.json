The HTML code which gets parsed looks like this:\n\n<a href=\"/old/something.html\" style=\"background-image:url('/old/images/background.png')\">link</a>\n\n\nOur configuration looks like this:\n\nProxyPass /  ajp://localhost:9000/webapp/\n<Location />\nSetOutputFilter INFLATE;proxy-html;DEFLATE\nProxyPassReverse /\nProxyHTMLExtended On\n\nProxyHTMLURLMap /old/ /new/\n\nRequestHeader unset Accept-Encoding\n</Location>\n\n\nAnd in the module config file I added this:\n\nProxyHTMLLinks  a               href style\n\nFrom my understanding this should now filter the HREF and the STYLE attribute. But it only filters the HREF.\n\nEither the documentation is not clear enough or there is really a bug in the software.\n\nI tested it with httpd version 2.4.6 which was coming with CentOS7.
