As soon as I move test script to point identical HTTPS environment, it starts invalidating sessions just after 3+ simultaneous threads. \n\nHere is the config.\n- Cookie Manager: clearing cookie on each iteration.\n- Cookie Manger: default policy (Have tried all the combination.)\n- Protocol: https, Port: 443\n- Reading dynamic login information from CSV config data.\n\nApart from HTTP vs HTTPS there is no difference at all between both the environments.\n\n(If I have recorded script from HTTP environment. Does that make any difference if recorded from HTTPS environment? Do I need to re-record it again from newly targeted environment?)", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Hello,\nBugzilla is not a suppot forum.\nPlease use JMeter Users mailing list to ask your question.\nAfter discussions on this mailing list, if discussion leads you to think it's a bug, then reopen an issue attaching a simple test plan to reproduce your issue and as many details as you can.\n\nRegards", "is_private": false, "id": 159075, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2012-05-15T20:51:03Z", "bug_id": 53236, "creation_time": "2012-05-15T20:51:03Z", "attachment_id": null}]
