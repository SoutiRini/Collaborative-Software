However, I think that you're biting yourself - using \".new\" like I did isn't about some developer who made a poor choice with a function name, it is the EL version of using a standard library call: <%=pageContext.getSession().isNew()%> .\n\nI suspect that sooner or later, every JSP user (and possibly also JSF and Spring users if it happens there too) with Tomcat 7 will have to enable this SKIP_IDENTIFIER_CHECK property, so setting this property to \"false\" by default isn't really the best idea you ever had.\n\nSo my suggestion is to set it to true by default again, maybe for Tomcat 8 :-)"}, {"count": 1, "text": "Just write your code as ${pageContext.session['new']}\n\nThe default will not be changed, because of specification compliance.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 50147 ***", "bug_id": 51108, "attachment_id": null, "id": 145957, "time": "2011-04-22T11:07:39Z", "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-04-22T11:07:39Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
