I realize \nthat for backwards compatibility that the attribute should be optional and \ndefault to false, but I cannot tell you how many times this problem has caused \nme to go through additional efforts to come up with a workaround.\nIf the parameter was mutable then when calling subtasks, if inheritAll=\"true\", \nthe subtask should be be working with a reference to the original parameter or \nthe parameter value should be copied back to the calling task upon completion \nof the subtask call.\n\nAn example of how it might look would be the following:\n<parameter name=\"myparam\" value=\"true\" mutable=\"true\"/>\n\nBy allowing it to be optionally mutable, I could later us a condition to call a \nsubtask which would modify the attribute if needed:\n\n<condition property=\"myparam\">\n  <equals arg1=\"${param1}\" arg2=\"${param2}/>\n</condition>"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This is against Ants philosophy.
