The\nassistance of an linux guru shows, that building a rpm in our case must use the\nrpmbuild executable, while using the rpm executable does not fit. A look into\nthe source of the rpm task shows, that the determination of the rpmbuild\nexecutable is done by splitting the environment's PATH variable and trying to\nopen the file on each part. Before splitting the path parts, the start of the\nenvironment variable PATH= gets cut off (planned!) but there is the mistake,\nwhich destroys the first path element. If rpmbuild is inside this path it is not\nfound and the rpm task tries to to use its fallback (rpm).", "id": 88256, "time": "2006-04-19T08:04:47Z", "creator": "wolfgang.brodowski@gebit.de", "creation_time": "2006-04-19T08:04:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39345, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 88523, "time": "2006-04-26T21:20:35Z", "creator": "jkf@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-04-26T21:20:35Z", "text": "Thanks, fixed on HEAD, please verify"}]
