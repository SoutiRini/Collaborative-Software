The rules used to\n    decide when and how to encode a URL are server-specific. All URLs\n    emitted by a servlet should be run through this method. Note that\n    this encodeURL( ) method could more properly have been named\n    rewriteURL( ) so as not to be confused with the URL encoding\n    process that encodes special characters in URL strings.\n\nThe call to URLEncoder.encode() must be done explicitely.\n\nHowever, I do agree it would be convenient if <c:url> not only\ndid the rewriting, but the encoding as well. Not clear to me why \nthe Expert Group did not think of this at the time.\n\nI've submitted an RFE to the JSTL spec so it can be considerered.\n\nSee:\nhttps://jstl-spec-public.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=22\n\nThanks!  -- Pierre\n", "id": 83347, "time": "2005-12-07T00:31:09Z", "creator": "pierre.delisle@sun.com", "creation_time": "2005-12-07T00:31:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
