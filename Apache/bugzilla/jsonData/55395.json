We recently upgraded from Red Hat Linux 4 to Oracle Linux 5.8.  After upgrading we saw a significant increase 4-5 times as many 400 errors from IE 8 and IE 9 in our logs.  No 400 errors from firefox or chrome.  The issue is extremely difficult to reproduce.  It took me 3 hours of just constant clicking from a remote site to be able to reproduce.  I am not able to reproduce from our office which is where our data center is located.  Latency does appear to be a factor.\n\nBelow is a debug log when I was able to reproduce.  The line AH01382: Request body read timeout is where the issue occurs.  We've turned down the ready body timeout to 20 seconds which has helped with the hanging behavior.\n\nAny reports of similar issues or advice on how to fix or at least reduce the frequency of the issue?  \n\n\n[Fri Jun 07 12:10:43.913581 2013] [proxy:debug] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] proxy_util.c(2013): AH00942: AJP: has acquired connection for (orapm01)\n[Fri Jun 07 12:10:43.913591 2013] [proxy:debug] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] proxy_util.c(2065): [client 172.22.112.119:50788] AH00944: connecting ajp://orapm01:8009/pm-web/pages/rfi/rfi.html to orapm01:8009, referer: https://ohoralb01/pm-web/pages/rfi/rfi.html?conversationId=38916\n[Fri Jun 07 12:10:43.913601 2013] [proxy:debug] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] proxy_util.c(2187): [client 172.22.112.119:50788] AH00947: connected /pm-web/pages/rfi/rfi.html to orapm01:8009, referer: https://ohoralb01/pm-web/pages/rfi/rfi.html?conversationId=38916\n[Fri Jun 07 12:11:03.933700 2013] [reqtimeout:info] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] [client 172.22.112.119:50788] AH01382: Request body read timeout\n[Fri Jun 07 12:11:03.933783 2013] [ssl:info] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] (70007)The timeout specified has expired: [client 172.22.112.119:50788] AH01991: SSL input filter read failed.\n[Fri Jun 07 12:11:03.933806 2013] [proxy_ajp:debug] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] mod_proxy_ajp.c(260): [client 172.22.112.119:50788] AH00871: ap_get_brigade failed, referer: https://ohoralb01/pm-web/pages/rfi/rfi.html?conversationId=38916\n[Fri Jun 07 12:11:03.933819 2013] [proxy:debug] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] proxy_util.c(2028): AH00943: AJP: has released connection for (orapm01)\n[Fri Jun 07 12:11:03.933887 2013] [proxy_balancer:debug] [pid 9991:tid 1106643264] mod_proxy_balancer.c(657): [client 172.22.112.119:50788] AH01176: proxy_balancer_post_request for (balancer://pmcluster), referer: https://ohoralb01/pm-web/pages/rfi/rfi.html?conversationId=38916"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "cthiele@mccarthy.com", "is_private": false, "id": 169661, "creation_time": "2013-08-22T19:39:26Z", "time": "2013-08-22T19:39:26Z", "bug_id": 55395, "text": "This ended up being an IE issue with ajax.
