Unfortunately this requires a little code surgery and\nnot only a small patch, because at the moment the shm is statically acquired\n(fixed size) and we need it before we parse the worker configuration, so beforee\nwe know, how many workers we have. To fix that, we would either need to count\nthe workers in a separate pass in advance, or enhance the shm handling to allow\ngrowth of it.\n\nAt the moment we initialize the shm for 64 workers, which on some platforms lead\nto 28800 Bytes size.
