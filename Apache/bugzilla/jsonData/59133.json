[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "apc4@ya.ru", "text": "I've noticed important regression in current trunk code, which supposed to become v.3.0. In BlazeMeter we have couple of plugins that are custom Thread Groups. One of them, \"Arrivals Thread Group\" is supposed to operate with \"arrival rate\" which is rate of \"first sampler of thread group\".\n\nWith JMeter 2.13 this thread group works as expected and produces valid load level. With trunk code it produces exactly 1/2 of expected load. As additional effect, we've noticed that threads that should be re-used for new arrivals are finished and new threads are created.\n\nFor example test plan, there are total 120 arrivals supposed to happen. This test plan is simpliest reproduction. Jmeter 2.13 gives expected 120 samples, while trunk gives only 60.\n\nI failed to find the source of this regression myself, I ask for help from other contributors. I can't share the source code publicly due to legal reasons, but can share it privately if this will help to solve regression.", "id": 189180, "time": "2016-03-06T18:27:33Z", "bug_id": 59133, "creation_time": "2016-03-06T18:27:33Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 33637, "creator": "apc4@ya.ru", "text": "Created attachment 33637\nReproduction test plan", "id": 189181, "time": "2016-03-06T18:27:59Z", "bug_id": 59133, "creation_time": "2016-03-06T18:27:59Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59133, "text": "Created attachment 33638\nLog for successfull run", "id": 189182, "time": "2016-03-06T18:28:44Z", "creator": "apc4@ya.ru", "creation_time": "2016-03-06T18:28:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 33638}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": 33639, "creator": "apc4@ya.ru", "text": "Created attachment 33639\nLog for failed trunk run", "id": 189183, "time": "2016-03-06T18:29:17Z", "bug_id": 59133, "creation_time": "2016-03-06T18:29:17Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59133, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 189472, "time": "2016-03-14T17:09:50Z", "creator": "support@ubikloadpack.com", "creation_time": "2016-03-14T17:09:50Z", "text": "Hello Andrei,\nCan you test this:\n- https://github.com/apache/jmeter/pull/164\n\nThanks\nRegards\n@ubikloadpack Team"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59133, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks, I will try it ASAP.", "id": 189474, "time": "2016-03-14T17:19:20Z", "creator": "apc4@ya.ru", "creation_time": "2016-03-14T17:19:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "apc4@ya.ru", "is_private": false, "id": 189475, "time": "2016-03-14T17:28:17Z", "bug_id": 59133, "creation_time": "2016-03-14T17:28:17Z", "tags": [], "text": "yes, the fix removes the regression issue, I got correct threads behavior"}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59133, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Date: Mon Mar 14 20:10:09 2016\nNew Revision: 1734992\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1734992&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 59133 - Regression in custom Thread Group in nightly build before 3.0 (6 march 2016)\n#resolve #164\nhttps://github.com/apache/jmeter/pull/164\nBugzilla Id: 59133\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/threads/JMeterThread.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 189480, "time": "2016-03-14T20:30:33Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-03-14T20:30:33Z", "is_private": false}]
