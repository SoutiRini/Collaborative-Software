The path morphing appears as expected, in comparison with Opera 10a (build 1139).\n\nNevertheless, by performing the comparison with Opera, I noticed why the filling was so strange in Batik: the pattern seems pretty messed up, whereas in Opera it displays as coherently expected (that is, with the flag colors of Austria and Switzerland. :-|\n\nI'd say this example needs to be further reduced in order to hunt down this weird pattern behavior. I'll probably try to do this myself whenever I find some more spare time but, for now, I guess updating this issue's status was more valuable than defer that for I-don't-know-how-long... :-)\n\nRemoving the \"path morphing\" from the summary and changing operating system to all as I noticed this using Windows XP SP3. Also Batik version was updated to 1.8.
