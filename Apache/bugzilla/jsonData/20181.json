I'm trying to use\nJMeter to test a ASPX web service. What happens is the server responds \"Server\nfound content type to be 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', but expected\n'text/xml'\". The request has to be sent with text/xml encoding since that's what\nASPX webservice demands. I did a little testing with JWSDP and javax.xml.soap\nworks fine with IIS. the better way to handle webservice soap requests would be\nto load the parameters from the WSDL. I'm still trying to find a simple solution\nto this that doesn't requiring writing a whole new HTTP sampler and all the\nnecessary gui elements. Additional information.
