Hence, I would like to know the pointers to proper way of achieving this.\n\nIf someone has come across any documentation/examples it would be really helpful. Thanks in advance.\n\nRegards,\nJain.", "count": 0, "id": 129606, "time": "2009-08-11T04:56:14Z", "bug_id": 47674, "creation_time": "2009-08-11T04:56:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "As mentioned on the user list, both the MDC (mapped diagnostic context) and NDC (nested diagnostic context) are designed to address this need and are decently documented online.
