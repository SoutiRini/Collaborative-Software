Is there anything more you need to review the patch?\n\nThe patch is only three lines of code and it makes the SXSSF api consistent with the XSSF api when it comes to escaping cell string values.\n\nWhen SXSSF writes string cells it iterates over the string locking for characters that need escaping. The valid characters are kept in a buffer and are flushed when an escaped character is written. The flushing part is missing for Unicode control characters. That's what this patch adds.\n\nWe have used the patch in production for five weeks now without any insidents.\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything more.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 160671, "creator": "martin.andersson@purplescout.se", "time": "2012-07-16T12:55:50Z", "bug_id": 53360, "creation_time": "2012-07-16T12:55:50Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53360, "text": "I will give my feedback within a few days. \n\nThanks for your patience.\n\nYegor", "id": 160672, "time": "2012-07-16T12:59:38Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2012-07-16T12:59:38Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53360, "text": "patch applied in r1362093\n\nRegards,\nYegor", "id": 160673, "time": "2012-07-16T15:32:53Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2012-07-16T15:32:53Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
