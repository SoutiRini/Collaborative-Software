We are using a simple html file to setup \nour Web Server.\n\nTheoritically, the hits/sec served by any server should go to maximum level and \nthen stay at the level irrespective of the increase load (the no. of concurrent \nusers logging in). The server throughput would always be the same. The Response \ntime will go up as the load is increased, but the throughput for the server \nremains the same.\n\nCau anyone tell us where we are making a mistake? Are we not doing the right \nthing? Which all places do we need to look at? \n\nIf you need more info then kindly contact me!", "id": 24123, "time": "2002-10-08T10:00:43Z", "bug_id": 13400, "creation_time": "2002-10-08T10:00:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13400, "text": "This doesn't really seem like a bug report so much as a request for help\nwhich should be directed to a user support group.\n\nIn general, it is not surprising that as you overload a server, the\nthroughput will decrease.
