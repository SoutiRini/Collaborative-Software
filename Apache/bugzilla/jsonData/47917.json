[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47917, "text": "There have been several (somehow recent) reports in the mailing list [1] [2] [3] regarding a MacOS-specific issue with text rendering, namely what seems to be a regression in version 10.5. Reports also aim towards a workaround consisting in disabling Quartz, so I'm documenting this in order to try gathering more information on this issue and/or to server as a placeholder for patches.\n\nThis may also help fixing/working around the issue reported in issue 41451.\n\nNote that I've set the OS as Mac OS X 10.4, although this seems to be specific to version 10.5 (which is not available in the list). Confirmations on which specific MacOSX version do the symptoms reproduce are welcome!\n\n[1] http://www.nabble.com/Text-Not-Displaying-ts24550763.html\n[2] http://www.nabble.com/Problem-with-text-on-OSX-ts24841934.html\n[3] http://www.nabble.com/RE%3A-JSVGCanvas-SVG-display-only-partial-document-on-MAC-OS-10.5-ts25493305.html", "id": 130750, "time": "2009-09-29T15:49:35Z", "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-09-29T15:49:35Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47917, "text": "According to the reports, a possible fix would be detecting [1] [2] the specific platform and tweaking the settings in accordance.

There isn't enough evidence that this is really MacOS X 10.5 specific, more feedback is welcome (as stated in comment 0);\n2. I don't much of an idea on where to place this sort of code. Placing anywhere within the GVT text classes should help, but I invite anyone with better Java skills to make a more specific proposal and/or submit a patch.\n\n[1] http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2002/tn2110.html#PARTONE\n[2] http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#getProperties%28%29", "id": 130751, "time": "2009-09-29T16:11:21Z", "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-09-29T16:11:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47917, "text": "*** Bug 48028 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 131243, "time": "2009-10-20T04:35:49Z", "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-10-20T04:35:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47917, "is_private": false, "text": "I guess this should block the 1.8 release.
