It passes all layout engine tests and I have compared the area trees\nwith the current trunk code. I therefore sincerely hope it is not a step backwards.\n\nThere are also some steps forward. Percentages on leader-length and\nleader-pattrern-width should work. background-position-x/y percentages should\nalso work in a generic way. Percentages relative to cell dimensions should be ok.\n\nThere is more work to be done in this area. This is not the final word on\npercentages. But because of its size I would like to get this reviewed and if\naccepted put into SVN so my code base doesn't branch too badly from the main stream.\n\nBTW, I haven't got rid completely of the LayoutDimension stuff. It is still used\nfor tables columns with proportional-column-width() specs. This still needs to\nbe looked at."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36379, "text": "Created attachment 16213\nThe main patch", "id": 79058, "time": "2005-08-26T15:16:21Z", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-08-26T15:16:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 16213}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36379, "attachment_id": 16214, "text": "Created attachment 16214\nOne new class to go into org.apache.fop.layoutmgr", "id": 79059, "time": "2005-08-26T15:17:20Z", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-08-26T15:17:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "text": "Created attachment 16215\nAnother new class for org.apache.fop.datatypes", "bug_id": 36379, "is_private": false, "id": 79060, "time": "2005-08-26T15:18:22Z", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-08-26T15:18:22Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 16215}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "attachment_id": 16216, "text": "Created attachment 16216\nA few additional testcases", "id": 79061, "time": "2005-08-26T15:19:01Z", "bug_id": 36379, "creation_time": "2005-08-26T15:19:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36379, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 16248\nRevised patch\n\nRevised, extended and better tested patch", "id": 79170, "time": "2005-08-30T14:02:59Z", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-08-30T14:02:59Z", "attachment_id": 16248}, {"count": 6, "text": "Created attachment 16249\nNew class to go into org.apache.fop.layoutmgr", "bug_id": 36379, "is_private": false, "id": 79171, "time": "2005-08-30T14:03:54Z", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-08-30T14:03:54Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 16249}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36379, "text": "Created attachment 16250\nNew class for org.apache.fop.datatypes", "id": 79172, "time": "2005-08-30T14:04:34Z", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-08-30T14:04:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 16250}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "attachment_id": 16251, "is_private": false, "id": 79173, "time": "2005-08-30T14:05:00Z", "bug_id": 36379, "creation_time": "2005-08-30T14:05:00Z", "text": "Created attachment 16251\nAnother new class for org.apache.fop.datatypes"}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36379, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 16252\nTestcases", "id": 79174, "time": "2005-08-30T14:05:38Z", "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-08-30T14:05:38Z", "attachment_id": 16252}, {"count": 10, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36379, "is_private": false, "text": "Applied as revision 265577.\n\nI changed the handling of line-height and font-size and \"em\" unit to avoid the\ncalculation of FixedLengths and changed the LM.initialize() so it is called once\nfrom the parent LM just before getNextKnuthElements are about to be called.\n\nThe change to PDFRendere was not included in the commit.\n\nDiscussion of the patch here:\n\n  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112506553400001&r=1&w=2\n", "id": 79252, "time": "2005-08-31T22:37:43Z", "creator": "bckfnn@worldonline.dk", "creation_time": "2005-08-31T22:37:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 11, "tags": [], "creator": "mm@arcus.com.au", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 79258, "time": "2005-09-01T03:05:46Z", "bug_id": 36379, "creation_time": "2005-09-01T03:05:46Z", "text": "Finn, Thank you!
