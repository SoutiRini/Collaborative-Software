[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31735, "text": "Test environment:\n* JDK 1.4\n* Slide WebDAV Library 2.1b1\n  running in a repository on a\n* Apache HTTP Server 2.0.48 (Linux) with mod_dav enabled\n* followRedirects is enabled\n\nWorkflow:\nA WebDAV resource is created for the URL \"/dav/sandbox/\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc\". Slide does \ntransforms this into an URL \"/dav/sandbox/%C3%A4%C3%B6%C3%BC\" which is \ncorrect. The resource \"\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc\" is a collection, so the Apache HTTP server sends a \nredirect response back to follow to the URL \"/dav/sandbox/%c3a4%c3%b6%c3%bc/\" \n(notice the lowercase hex-values and the leading slash). The redirect is being \nfollowed and the Apache HTTP server sends a correct XML response containing \nthe properties of the collection.\n\nThe Bug:\nIn the method setWebdavProperties() of WebdavResource.java, the XML response \nis being converted into Java objects. A response to a PROPFIND method usually \ncontains information on several resources. The URL which comes with the XML \nresponse and the URL which was requested are compared for equality to detect \nthe entry of the resource which belongs to the current WebdavResource object \n(line 1018). This equality check simply compares the String representation of \nboth URL by using the equals() method. It does not recognise that the \nhexadecimal values (encoded UTF-8 characters) could be lower- or uppercase. \nThe current WebdavResource is marked as being non-existent!", "id": 65203, "time": "2004-10-15T18:12:16Z", "creator": "smaugg@gmx.net", "creation_time": "2004-10-15T18:12:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
