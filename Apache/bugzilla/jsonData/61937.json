It seems that more specifically it returns only the cells with values in the file, as '<c>' elements that are physically present in the file but lack child elements will not result in cell events.\n\nRather than attempting to change the asserted design intent, the attached patch strives to make the intent and the mechanism for dealing with empty cells / rows more obvious to consumers by adding some documentation to the interface.\n\nRelated: https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57775\nRelated: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2479", "id": 202954, "time": "2017-12-29T18:59:06Z", "creator": "me@geoffbaskwill.ca", "creation_time": "2017-12-29T18:59:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "attachment_id": null, "id": 202995, "time": "2018-01-01T14:55:24Z", "bug_id": 61937, "creation_time": "2018-01-01T14:55:24Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Updated javadoc via r1819774."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61937, "attachment_id": null, "id": 202999, "creation_time": "2018-01-01T15:45:36Z", "time": "2018-01-01T15:45:36Z", "creator": "me@geoffbaskwill.ca", "text": "Thank you!", "is_private": false}]
