[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "This patch assigns width, height and common traits to block-container areas.\n\nIt contains the following changes:\n\n1) Keep the width and height properties in instance fields in\n   BlockContainerLM. I'm not at all sure that is the preferred\n   approach, but it makes sense to me. Feedback welcome.\n2) Add the child block in the BCLM.flush() after the child area tree has \n   been built. Othwerwise the auto height will always be zero and the \n   bpd is not incremented.\n3) Added a Block.addBlock(Block, boolean) method which block-container can\n   use when it is adding children to a fixed height block. The default \n   addBlock(Block) method still calculates the height based on the children.\n4) Pass overflow signals from the child LM through to the parent LM.\n   Otherwise no new page is created when a child block overflows a page\n   and an indefinite loop is entered.\n5) Sets common borders and background traits to the block-container area.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 49734, "creator": "bckfnn@worldonline.dk", "time": "2003-12-27T14:36:59Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-27T14:36:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bckfnn@worldonline.dk", "attachment_id": 9710, "id": 49735, "time": "2003-12-27T14:38:53Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-27T14:38:53Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 9710\nA unified diff against HEAD."}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": 9711, "creator": "bckfnn@worldonline.dk", "is_private": false, "id": 49736, "time": "2003-12-27T14:39:37Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-27T14:39:37Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 9711\nA .fo testcase."}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": 9712, "creator": "bckfnn@worldonline.dk", "is_private": false, "id": 49737, "time": "2003-12-27T14:41:02Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-27T14:41:02Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 9712\nThe .pdf result of the testcase after applying the patch."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Finn,\n\nPlease be careful--if-statements *must* always be in braces, as follows:\n\nif (something) {\n    single_statement;\n}\n\nSee:  http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc6.html#449, \nreferenced on our developer page.\n\nI'll make the changes to this patch, but please be careful in future coding.\n\nThanks,\nGlen", "is_private": false, "id": 49742, "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "time": "2003-12-27T20:14:00Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-27T20:14:00Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "Finn--\n\nI can't apply this, as part of the patch is missing (only \nBlockContainerLayoutManager.java is present, not the Block.java (and other?) \nchanges.\n\nThanks,\nGlen", "is_private": false, "id": 49743, "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "time": "2003-12-27T20:27:02Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-27T20:27:02Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "bckfnn@worldonline.dk", "is_private": false, "id": 49751, "time": "2003-12-28T00:38:38Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-28T00:38:38Z", "tags": [], "text": "New patch attached; complete this time and without the style violations.\n\nI'm sorry about the inconvenience this has caused."}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "bckfnn@worldonline.dk", "attachment_id": 9713, "id": 49752, "time": "2003-12-28T00:44:32Z", "bug_id": 25773, "creation_time": "2003-12-28T00:44:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 9713\nA unified diff against HEAD (complete this time)."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25773, "is_private": false, "count": 8, "id": 49769, "time": "2003-12-28T16:26:48Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-12-28T16:26:48Z", "text": "Finn, in your sample fo files, what you refer to as \"pixels\"--you mean \"points\"-\n-correct?\n\nAnyway, applied, but later more work will be needed with background traits--as \nthe PDF result shows, the entire block-container is not covered by the red \nbackground; possibly an issue with the PDF renderer.\n\nThanks,\nGlen"}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25773, "is_private": false, "text": "No, the sample .fo do use px (pixel) units.
