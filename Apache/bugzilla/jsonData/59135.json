Using Poi 3.10 using passwords longer than 15 characters was no problem\n\nAttached please find a test program to check this issue.\n\nbest regards\nDirk", "id": 189208, "time": "2016-03-07T15:52:17Z", "creator": "dirk.lang@de.soliver.com", "creation_time": "2016-03-07T15:52:17Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 33643}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59135, "attachment_id": 33646, "text": "Created attachment 33646\nCreatePasswordVerifier_Method1 with more than 15 chars\n\nThanks for pointing this out ... I've missed that the method1 functions take arbitrary length strings, whereas method2 functions are limited to 15 chars. (see MS-OFFCRYPTO - 2.3.7.* for more details)\n\nThis is a quick hack ... I'll apply it when I have applied all the other patches, which pile up since the last few weeks and little bit more testing is needed too. Furthermore I need to investigate why there's no implementation for EncryptData_Method1, this would be probably only needed for HWPF Xor obfuscation.\n\nAndi", "id": 189247, "time": "2016-03-08T01:10:36Z", "creator": "kiwiwings@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-03-08T01:10:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59135, "text": "applied via r1734843", "id": 189440, "time": "2016-03-13T19:32:29Z", "creator": "kiwiwings@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-03-13T19:32:29Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
