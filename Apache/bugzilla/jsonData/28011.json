If compiled with the \"--with-ssl=\" option it is fine. This does not\nhappen with the previous versions of httpd.\n\nSecond if the apache is compiled with mod_ssl, prefork, and deflate there are\nproblems accessing perl scripts in ssl mode from Internet Explorer version 6\n(Netscape is OK). Some scripts take forever to load. Also some images are not\nshown in ssl mode (IE and Netscape). When the web page is reloaded then the\nimages not shown before refresh are now shown but other images disappear that\nwere presented before refresh. This problems do not exist when the web page does\nnot run in ssl mode. Because of these problems I had to go back to httpd 2.0.48.", "id": 54808, "time": "2004-03-29T10:20:58Z", "creator": "glukasz@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-29T10:20:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28011, "attachment_id": null, "id": 62718, "time": "2004-08-30T05:35:52Z", "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "creation_time": "2004-08-30T05:35:52Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Dont enable mod_deflate for HTTPS.
