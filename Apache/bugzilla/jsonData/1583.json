Turning on debug in the SimpleMapper1 gave me :\n\n2001-04-30 05:35:00 - ContextManager: Host = homestore.dev.domania.com\n\nduring the initial request and then gave me:\n\n2001-04-30 05:35:31 - ContextManager: Host = localhost\n\nwhen I tried to do an include.  However, if I had a virtual host set up, say \"bandcamp\" I would get:\n\n  2001-04-30 05:36:13 - ContextManager: Host = bandcamp\n\nfor the request and \n\n2001-04-30 05:36:14 - ContextManager: Host = bandcamp\n\nfor the include.\n\nI would imagine that in most cases, this wouldn't cause an issue - but it just so happened, in this particular case, that I had a virtual host definition for \"localhost\" that was pointing at a different location that the default context - and so the includes were failing.  My particular issue was taken care of by getting rid of the virtual host definition for \"localhost\" .\n\nNote: request.getServerName() always reported the correct server name, even in the included files."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 1583, "attachment_id": null, "text": "The bug should be fixed in the latest beta for 3.2.2.
