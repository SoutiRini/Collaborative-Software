[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 22245\nSuggestion of adding folder check when creating new zip archive in executeMain\n\nCurrently the zip / jar / war / etc tasks fail if the parent directory of a new archive being created does not exist. \n\nThis can be prevented if we force the directory to be created. The suggested patch does so without user interaction, perhaps an attribute should be introduced for more control.\n\nAn example of this behavior can be found in the copy task. If you copy files to a directory that does not exists, this directory will be created (no attribute is required for this).\n\nI know I often forget to add the required mkdir task to ensure the directory exists, causing the build to fail. It would save me some headache if this behavior was implemented.", "attachment_id": 22245, "bug_id": 45377, "id": 118545, "time": "2008-07-11T02:58:05Z", "creator": "remie@backbase.com", "creation_time": "2008-07-11T02:58:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "perhaps it suits better if this logic was moved to the checkAttributesAndElements() method.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 45377, "id": 118546, "time": "2008-07-11T03:02:37Z", "creator": "remie@backbase.com", "creation_time": "2008-07-11T03:02:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 129944, "time": "2009-08-26T04:03:23Z", "bug_id": 45377, "creation_time": "2009-08-26T04:03:23Z", "text": "applied a similar patch to tar as well.\n\nsvn revision 807690"}, {"count": 3, "text": "actually it is svn revision 807960", "bug_id": 45377, "is_private": false, "id": 129945, "time": "2009-08-26T04:03:59Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-08-26T04:03:59Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
