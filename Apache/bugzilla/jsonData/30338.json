[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Greetings Apache,\n\nThank you for many years of superior software.\n\nPlatform Windows 2000, Cygwin 1.5.10, (the latest, July 25 2004).\n\nSteps:\n\nDownload Unix source, 2.0.50.\ndo ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache-2.0.50\nmake (no errors)\nmake install (no errors)\nedit conf/httpd.conf:\n  ServerName 127.0.0.1\n\n(I've also done ServerName localhost, same result)\ndo apachectl start:\n104 ~>apachectl start\n/usr/local/bin/apachectl start: httpd started\n\nNow here's the problem, httpd isn't actually running.\nIn Task Manager there's no httpd process, and if I try to get the default page \nusing \"http://localhost\" or \"http://127.0.0.1\" I see the \"page cannot be \ndisplayed\". \"ps\" shows no httpd, and \"apachectl stop\" says \"httpd (no pid file) \nnot running\".\n\nMoreover, there's no error message in logs/error_log. If I try to get detailed \nerrors using \"httpd -k start -e debug -E err.txt\" I see that err.txt is created \nbut it has a size of 0. So, the problem is not so much that httpd can't start \nbut that it's not starting and there's no debugging information.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with httpd's configuration:\n\n107 ~>httpd -t\nSyntax OK\n\nHere's more evidence that httpd has been compiled correctly:\n\n108 ~>httpd -l\nCompiled in modules:\n  core.c\n  mod_access.c\n  mod_auth.c\n  mod_include.c\n  mod_log_config.c\n  mod_env.c\n  mod_setenvif.c\n  prefork.c\n  http_core.c\n  mod_mime.c\n  mod_status.c\n  mod_autoindex.c\n  mod_asis.c\n  mod_cgi.c\n  mod_negotiation.c\n  mod_dir.c\n  mod_imap.c\n  mod_actions.c\n  mod_userdir.c\n  mod_alias.c\n  mod_so.c\n\nYour thoughts? Any other tests you'd like me to do?\n\nThanks again,\n\nBrian O.", "is_private": false, "id": 61160, "creator": "brian_osborne@cognia.com", "time": "2004-07-27T02:08:20Z", "bug_id": 30338, "creation_time": "2004-07-27T02:08:20Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "chip@force-elite.com", "text": "hm.\n\nPossible to run apache inside a debugger?
