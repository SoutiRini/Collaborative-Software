On latest nightly builds (ant 1.8.3alpha and ant 1.9.0alpha) when user inputs a value - he doesn\u2019t see what he's typing until enter button is pressed.\nAttached is a simple build.xml file that demonstrates the problem. It creates a\nsimple Java file that just calls readLine() and echos the input, compiles the\nfile, and runs it twice: once in a non-forked JVM, which works fine, and again\nin a forked JVM, which 'invisible' input.\nMy java version is 1.6.0_30-b12"}]
