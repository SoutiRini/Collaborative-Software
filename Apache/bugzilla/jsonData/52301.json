[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52301, "text": "When the server name that Apache determines does not match the certificate CN it produces an error message in this format:\n\n[Tue Dec 06 12:21:17 2011] [warn] RSA server certificate CommonName (CN) `baatara.usae.avaya.com' does NOT match server name!?\n\nUnfortunately, the message includes the CN found but not the server name that Apache is using, which makes it quite difficult to guess what might be going wrong if the CN is in fact the desired server name but the server name that Apache determines is not correct.\n\n(The configuration file did not include a ServerName directive and some aspect of the /etc/hosts file confused Apache, leading to Apache choosing the wrong server name.)\n\nThis situation would be easier to diagnose if this error message included the server name that Apache was matching with the CN.  In my case, this would result in something like:\n\n[Tue Dec 06 12:21:17 2011] [warn] RSA server certificate CommonName (CN) `baatara.usae.avaya.com' does NOT match server name 'localhost4'!?\n\nThis message would have given me strong hints as to where the problem lay.\n\nI suspect that this change would be simple to make.\n\nThis may be related to bug reports 10346 and 37911.", "id": 152057, "time": "2011-12-07T17:32:11Z", "creator": "worley@alum.mit.edu", "creation_time": "2011-12-07T17:32:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
