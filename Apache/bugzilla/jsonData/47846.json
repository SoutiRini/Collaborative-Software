The URLConnection class can use a cache, and apparently does so by default. When I was repeatedly running a script that had to have the most up-to-date version of a web page, this caused a problem that was difficult to track down. Get should either expose URLConnection's caching options to the user, or should always disable the use of caches as follows:\n\nconnection.setUseCaches(false);\n\nSince this caching behavior is not documented anywhere, this latter option might be preferable."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47846, "is_private": false, "text": "svn revision 807953 introduces a new httpusecaches attribute to control this.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 41891 ***", "id": 130432, "time": "2009-09-15T21:03:30Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-09-15T21:03:30Z", "attachment_id": null}]
