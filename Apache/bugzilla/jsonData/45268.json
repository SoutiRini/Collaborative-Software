Suppose we have a web service which is hosted on two different machines - one for reading, one for writing data. We might want to run a sequence of tests that first write some data and then check whether the change is visible. To keep things clean, we would still like to use http request defaults, but it becomes difficult, since we have requests going like this for instance:\n\nset(a)\nget(a)\nset(b)\nget(b)\n\nWhile configuring JDBC, we assign a variable name to a set of config values. After that, when a JDBC query is made, this variable name is used to decide where the request should go. Employing the same idea for http requests, and perhaps others which don't have it either, would incredibly ease the work in such cases as described above.", "is_private": false}]
