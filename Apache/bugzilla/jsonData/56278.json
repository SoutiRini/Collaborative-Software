I'm not entirely sure of the file format, because the file was downloaded from http://members.fhlbdm.com/member-tools/advance-rates/csv/ which is a banking website not under my control. I am able to open the file directly in Excel, but not in POI. Here's the stack trace I'm getting when I try to create a new XSSF workbook using an input stream of the file:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook.onDocumentRead(XSSFWorkbook.java:284)\n\tat org.apache.poi.POIXMLDocument.load(POIXMLDocument.java:159)\n\tat org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook.<init>(XSSFWorkbook.java:221)\n\t...\n\nPlease find the file attached. I'm running JDK 7 update 51 and this trace was taken from a JUnit test case executed in IntelliJ IDEA. I'm using POI with the OOXML module, built using Maven.\n\nI've tried searching the internet for this exception, and I see a few descriptions of similar behavior but no resolutions. The following external link may also be related http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18274995/nullpointerexception-when-trying-to-read-xlsx-file as it is also a Mac and a similar error. In this tracker, my problem may be related to ticket 16488, since the spreadsheet does have some cells with Excel warnings. \n\nThanks in advance!"}, {"count": 1, "text": "Your file is missing a styles table, which we assumed files would always have\n\nFixed in r1578518 - we now create one if missing, just as we do for a missing SST", "bug_id": 56278, "attachment_id": null, "id": 173882, "time": "2014-03-17T19:02:43Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2014-03-17T19:02:43Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56278, "text": "Thank you Nick!", "id": 173887, "time": "2014-03-17T20:43:06Z", "creator": "leibge@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-03-17T20:43:06Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56278, "attachment_id": null, "id": 175225, "time": "2014-05-14T20:19:32Z", "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2014-05-14T20:19:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 56490 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}]
