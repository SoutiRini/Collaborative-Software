(We are using xalan for\nthis).  The work around would be putting the jar files in common/lib, but this\nis not ideal and prevents each webapp from having its own XML handling classes."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 6374 ***", "id": 11117, "time": "2002-02-25T16:53:57Z", "bug_id": 6656, "creation_time": "2002-02-25T16:53:57Z", "is_private": false}]
