This can result into incomprehensible text.\n\nTo fix that problem, a hyphenated word should properly be tagged as such. This can be done in 2 ways.\n\nThe first possibility is to add an 'ActualText' entry to the property list of the corresponding marked-content sequence. Its value would basically be the whole text minus the last hyphen character.\n\nThe second possibility is to replace the last hyphen with a soft hyphen character, which will be recognized by screen readers such that the split word will be read as one. This will work only if the font has a glyph for the soft hyphen character.\n\nThe latter possibility is the recommended way to handle hyphenated words. The former can be implemented as a fallback for when there is no available glyph for the soft hyphen, or when the hyphenation character is not actually a hyphen (this can be customized through the hyphenation-character property)."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54081, "is_private": false, "text": "Fixed in rev. 1405158:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1405158&view=rev", "id": 163147, "time": "2012-11-02T21:01:51Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-02T21:01:51Z", "attachment_id": null}]
