The table is only about 1/3 the width of a normal browser page and there is a following legend of no less than eleven lines containing the full description of the abbreviated headers. The legend could be completely eliminated by using the full description in the headings, as is already done in the balancer-manager display. And there seems no good reason for these displays to be visually different anyway."}]
