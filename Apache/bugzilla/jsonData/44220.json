[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I've written a (quick) patch which allows an end user to attach logfiles to\njunit generated test reports. \n\nThe patch introduces three new optional attributes to the junitreport ant task: \n  * logDir - The base dir for the test logfiles\n  * logPrefix - A prefix which may be used to distinguish the log files from the\ntest\nresults.\n  * logPostfix - A postfix which defaults to '.xml' and can be used to\ndistinguish the\nlog files from the test results.\n\nIf no prefix or postfix values are used the report generator will assume the\ntest class\nname is the name of the log file. \nIf a logfile cannot be found this will be silently ignored and no link to the\nlogfile\nwill appear in the resulting JUnit report.\n\nWhen a link to a log file does appear it is formatted in the same way as links\nto stdour\nor stderr are formatted.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 44220, "id": 112795, "time": "2008-01-14T01:26:16Z", "creator": "s_potijk@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2008-01-14T01:26:16Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44220, "text": "Created attachment 21382\nThis patch introduces adding logfiles to JUnit test reports\n\nA patch on http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/core/trunk revision 609533", "id": 112796, "attachment_id": 21382, "creator": "s_potijk@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2008-01-14T01:28:21Z", "time": "2008-01-14T01:28:21Z", "is_private": false}]
