[{"count": 0, "text": "Compiling in the modules/aaa directory with make local-build.  During the \nbuild of each module.c to its .lo file, I get numerous syntax errors from  \nsrc/apr/libtool.  Tracing it out takes me to the grep -e test at lines  4265 \nand 4268.  At this point the script's dependendcy_libs env vars equal \"-\nL/usr/local/Berkeley -L/usr/local/lib\".  Problem #1 is that Solaris's grep \ndoesn't support a \"-e\" option.  I fixed this easily fixed by switching to \negrep. However, problem #2 surfaces in those same lines in that the S and D \nenv vars used in testing are both null, leading to yet another syntax \ncomplaint out of egrep. The S var is assigned the PWORKDIR var at line 4262 \nwhich is null, and nowhere assigned in the entire Apache distribution. I could \nfind no assignment whatsoever for the D var in the libtool script.  The make \ndoesn't blow up, but I don't if that's a problem or not.\n\n---dave k", "bug_id": 16953, "is_private": false, "id": 31047, "time": "2003-02-11T04:17:21Z", "creator": "dwkoehler@comcast.net", "creation_time": "2003-02-11T04:17:21Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "jerenkrantz@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 31411, "time": "2003-02-17T08:12:32Z", "bug_id": 16953, "creation_time": "2003-02-17T08:12:32Z", "text": "Wow.  This looks like a bug due to the machine that httpd-2.0.44 was rolled on.  As far as I can tell, the stock version of libtool-1.4.3 does not have these lines.\n\nThe only fix I can suggest is to install autoconf and libtool 1.4.3 yourself from the official GNU sources, and re-run buildconf.  You may encounter a problem where apr-util and pcre are not configured correctly due to a shell limitation in Solaris (2.0.44 doesn't configure for me at all on my Solaris machine).  If that happens, you need the latest snapshot of APR and rerun buildconf.\n\nWe will make sure this is resolved for the next release.\n\nThanks for using Apache HTTP Server!"}, {"count": 2, "text": "Hmpf.
