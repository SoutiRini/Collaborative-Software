Running it \nin Tomcat 4.1.24 with struts 1.1 RC1 demonstrate a wrong behavior. In the \ntree, childs are duplicated instead of beeing  unique. Hard to explain, you \nhave to see for yourself. I have reproduced the problem with Tomcat 4.1.24 but \nnot with Tomcat 4.0. I also tried with Jetty and Jetty that uses jasper from \ntomcat 4.0 works but the problem is found in Jetty that uses jasper from \nTomcat 4.1. So I think it is pretty clear that the problems lies in the new \njasper found in tomcat 4.1.\n\nIf you need more info, just ask.\n\nThanks,\nnicfournier.", "id": 35931, "time": "2003-04-23T20:44:13Z", "bug_id": 19260, "creation_time": "2003-04-23T20:44:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19260, "text": "Created attachment 5978\nThe packaged war file that demonstrate the behavior (only thing missing is struts 1.1 rc1 in WEB-INF/lib).", "id": 35933, "time": "2003-04-23T21:39:07Z", "creator": "nicfournier@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-04-23T21:39:07Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 5978}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19260, "attachment_id": null, "id": 35953, "time": "2003-04-24T07:48:37Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-24T07:48:37Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Personally, I think the problem is with tag pooling (whatever taglibs used by\nthe webapp are not spec compliant)."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19260, "attachment_id": null, "id": 35976, "time": "2003-04-24T12:27:12Z", "creator": "nicfournier@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-04-24T12:27:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "So you think the bug would be in struts ??"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19260, "text": "Possibly.
