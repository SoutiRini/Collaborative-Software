[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The HTTPS configuration in Tomcat 3.3a is lacking an\n\nimportant feature: You cannot configure the keystore type.\n\n\n\nWell, the feature is \"almost\" there, as the \n\norg.apache.tomcat.util.net.SSLSocketFactory *does* support the\n\n\"keystoreType\" attribute. Only, it is not passed to the factory in\n\norg.apache.tomcat.modules.server.PoolTcpConnector. So fixing\n\nthis should be easy (untested): Just add an\n\n\n\npublic void setKeystoreType( String k ) {\n\n   attributes.put( \"keystoreType\", k);\n\n}\n\n\n\nto PoolTcpConnector.java\n\n\n\nWhy this is needed: The default keystore type is JKS, which is\n\nalmost useless in real life because you cannot import your existing\n\nPKCS12 keys/certificates. Only keys generated by keytool itself work.\n\nUnfortunately this is not an option if you have paid big bucks to have your\n\nkey certified by a CA.\n\n\n\nWorkaround: Use mod_jk and let mod_ssl handle all encryption.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 9840, "creator": "olaf.jahn@zamioculcas.net", "time": "2002-01-24T11:24:01Z", "bug_id": 6004, "creation_time": "2002-01-24T11:24:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 6004, "is_private": false, "id": 9906, "time": "2002-01-25T05:10:31Z", "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "creation_time": "2002-01-25T05:10:31Z", "tags": [], "text": "This is fixed in the current Tomcat 3.3.1-dev.\n\nThe Http10Connector entry in server.xml will accept any attribute specified.\nThose without predefined setters will be saved as attributes along with the\nother SSL related attributes which do have predefined setters.
