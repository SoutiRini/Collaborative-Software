Therefore, if you use an ErrorDocument 401 directive then it must\nrefer to a local document.\"\n\n..When using the ErrorDocument Directive.  But it appears that even if the file\nis local, the client will not recieve a prompt for a username/password.\n\nI had the line of \"Errordocument 401 /401.phtml\" which worked fine in Apache\n1.3.x but in 2.0.x, the browser no longer asks for a user/pass when entering a\nlocked-down site.\n\nPacket sniffing the two configurations, I see both are passing the\n'WWW-Authenticate:' info, but (obviously) one is passing a \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\",\nwhile the other is passing \"HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required\"\n\nSo, is Apache 2.x correct, and Apache 1.3.x was wrong in it's behavior?  Is the\nbrowser responsible, since it should pay attention to the 'WWW-Authenticate'\nheader?
