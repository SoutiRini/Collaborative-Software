(By a config option of course.)\n\nInstead this HTML code\n\n<h1>Index of /pub/c64/Demos/d/Daniax</h1>\n\nThis would be generated:\n\n<h1>Index of /<a href=\"/pub/\">pub</a>/<a href=\"/c64/\">c64</a>/<a href=\"/Demos/\">Demos</a>/<a href=\"/d/\"></a>d</a>/<a href=\"/Daniax/\">Daniax</a></h1>\n\n(I know, that someone could define a script for header to generate this. But if this could be generated by mod_autoindex itself, that may help users to make easy to browse site without an external CGI or PHP script.)"}]
