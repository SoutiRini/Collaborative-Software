[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sdoherty@kc.rr.com", "text": "The CompositeRollingAppender and DailyFileAppender each have a compile error \nin the setFile(String filename, boolean appender) method. Each calls its super \nclass, FileAppender, with the following snippet of code:\n\n          super.setFile(fileName, append);\n\nAfter version 1.1.3 of Log4j, the FileAppender.setFile(String filename, \nboolean appender) was changed to FileAppender.setFile(String filename, boolean \nappender, boolean bufferedIO, int bufferSize). It appears that some of the sub-\nclasses of FileAppender haven't yet adopted this change but still call the non-\nexistant method resutling in the compile error.\n\nOther classes that subclass FileAppender (DailyRollingFileAppender, \nRollingFileAppender, and ExternallyRolledFileAppender) appear to have adopted \nthe 4 argument setFile method and do not provide for a two argument setFile \nmethod at all.\n\nTo fix, my recommendation is to change CompositeRollingAppender and \nDailyFileAppender to offer the 4 argument method and remove the two argument \nmethod. While deprecating the two argument method might be considered less \nintrusive to existing code that may be using this, no code can successfully \ninvoke the 2 argument method without resulting in a runtime exception.\n\nThanks.", "id": 23341, "time": "2002-09-25T03:09:30Z", "bug_id": 12983, "creation_time": "2002-09-25T03:09:30Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 24222, "time": "2002-10-09T18:27:06Z", "bug_id": 12983, "creation_time": "2002-10-09T18:27:06Z", "text": "\nRollingFileAppender and DailyRollingFileAppender simply use the setFile method \nof their parent class.
