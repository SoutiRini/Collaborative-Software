In that model borders can only be specified on fo:table and fo:table-cell elements. So the border-top property set on the fo:table-row inside the table-header is ignored. And the behaviour is perfectly normal. If you want a border at the top of the cell, just specify the border-top property there.\n\nAgreed, a warning could have helped. No warnings are issued by default since borders are allowed on fo:table-row in the collapsing-border model.\n\nI'm closing this bug and will open another one, requesting for a warning to be issued in such a situation.\n\nThanks,\nVincent", "bug_id": 47636, "is_private": false, "id": 129526, "time": "2009-08-06T04:02:09Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-08-06T04:02:09Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs", "bug_id": 47636, "is_private": false, "id": 156614, "time": "2012-04-01T13:50:33Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:50:33Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
