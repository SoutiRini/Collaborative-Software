[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 21576, "text": "This problem can occur in any taglib.\n\nMany people have reported over the past year or so the following type of error:\n\n\"An error occurred while evaluating custom action attribute \"value\" with \nvalue \"${qItems.title}\": Unable to find a value for \"title\" in object of \nclass \"java.lang.String\" using operator \".\" (null)\"\n\nI was able to determine that this is due to the taglib (jstl.lib and/or \nstandard.lib) not being in the application classpath at runtime.\n\nThis happens often in the Forte (Sun 1 studio) environment because it does not \ncopy the application libs.  You need to manually put them into the Forte \ncommon/lib (e.g., D:\\Program Files\\s1studio_jdk\\s1studio\\tomcat401\\common\\lib).\n\nHOWEVER the taglib bug is that it gives a bogus error message that just \nconfuses people.  I'm sure the base error is some kind of class not found \nexception (which would be helpful), but is instead being swallowed, resulting \neventually in the incorrect and unhelpful error above.  \n\nProper error handling and reporting is an important part of any product-\nquality code.  This problem needs to be fixed to report a better error.\n\n  -- Frank", "id": 40652, "time": "2003-07-14T16:59:21Z", "creator": "flawlor@athensgroup.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-14T16:59:21Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "t5jtjj502@sneakemail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Frank,\n\nAre you sure the problem is a ClassNotFoundException?

It is an Enumeration.\n\nI meant to include an example of the tag code which causes this:\n\n      <c_rt:forEach items='<%=pageContext.getRequest().getAttribute(\"foo\")%>' \nvar=\"qItems\"  varStatus=\"status\">\n            <tr>\n              <td class=SITErowodd align=\"right\"><c:out \nvalue=\"${qItems.memberid}\" /></td>\n     ...\n\nYou should be able to reporoduce this by taking any JSP with this type of tag \nand removing jstl.lib and/or standard.lib from tomcat (e.g., make sure it \nisn't in <tomcat>/common/lib or the <webapp>/WEB-INF/lib).\n\nIn short, everything is fine when the libs are provided and throw the \nspecified type of error when they are removed.  The problem is that the \nmessage is too meaningless to give people a clue to the problem (thus it has \nbeen unsolved for over a year despite many complaints in the forums).\n\nI've had this same kind of problem with my libs that try to introspect on \napplication classes when I failed to put my lib in one of the above Tomcat \nlocations.  The behavior is very misleading since non-introspection uses of \nthe lib are no problem so long as the lib is somewhere in the classpath.\n\n  -- Frank", "id": 40865, "time": "2003-07-16T22:01:16Z", "creator": "flawlor@athensgroup.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-16T22:01:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21576, "text": "Hi again,\n\nI tried to reproduce this error on Tomcat 4.1.24, but it didn't happened.\n\nWhen I removed both jars or only standard.jar, I got this error:\n\norg.apache.jasper.JasperException: /hello.jsp(2,0) Unable to load class forEach\n\tat\norg.apache.jasper.compiler.DefaultErrorHandler.jspError(DefaultErrorHandler.java:94)\n\n\nWhen I removed only jstl.jar, I got this:\n\njavax.servlet.ServletException: javax/servlet/jsp/jstl/core/LoopTagSupport\n\tat org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:249)\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:853)\n\t\n\nI still think the problem is other than the missing jars (although you say\nthat's the only way you can reproduce the error).
