[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39097, "text": "Notes:\n - Misc cleanup and refactoring of the code\norg.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.Picture is obsolete and goes away.\nInstead two new classes are used:\norg.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.PictureData - holds picture data as read from\nPictures OLE stream\norg.apache.poi.hslf.model.Picture extends Shape. - Image frame in a slide\n \n - Added default constructor to SlideShow and HSLFSlideShow to create\nan empty ppt file and setup its initial structure from a template file:\n\n    public HSLFSlideShow() throws IOException  {\n         \nthis(HSLFSlideShow.class.getResourceAsStream(\"/org/apache/poi/hslf/data/empty.ppt\"));\n    }\nempty.ppt is resource file and must be copied to its location by the compile\nscript. \n\n\n - Support for adding pictures to a slide. Actually Picture is a subclass of Shape\nwhich holds reference to the picture data, position of the picture in the slide,\netc.\n\n Use case:\n\n        SlideShow ppt = new SlideShow();\n\n        slide = ppt.createSlide();\n        \n        //picture is global object. It is shared across all slides.\n        int idx = ppt.addPicture(new File(\"hello.jpg\"), Picture.JPEG);\n        \n        Picture pict = new Picture(idx);\n        pict.setDefaultSize(ppt); \n        slide.addShape(pict);\n \n- Fixed bug with serialization of pictures.\n before this commit HSLFSlideShow.write skipped writing pictures and the data\nwas lost.\nNow everything works right. Pictures are preserved.\n\n\nRegards, Yegor", "id": 87216, "time": "2006-03-24T16:40:59Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2006-03-24T16:40:59Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39097, "text": "Created attachment 17970\npatch with changes", "id": 87217, "time": "2006-03-24T16:44:25Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2006-03-24T16:44:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 17970}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 17971\naffected sources", "id": 87218, "time": "2006-03-24T16:46:04Z", "bug_id": 39097, "creation_time": "2006-03-24T16:46:04Z", "attachment_id": 17971}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39097, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 87220, "time": "2006-03-24T16:53:16Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2006-03-24T16:53:16Z", "text": "Looks good, thanks for this.
