Use request.useSecret=\"true\" and request.secret=\"secret key word\" in your Tomcat AJP Connector configuration. \n\nIf you set a secret on a load balancer, all its members will inherit this secret. \n\nThis feature has been added in jk 1.2.12.\"\n\nHowever, I do not see anymore these request. directives explained in the \"Apache Tomcat Configuration Reference\" > \"The AJP Connector\"\n   http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/ajp.html\n   http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/ajp.html\n\nNote: that the syntax changed from Tomcat 4.1 to Tomcat 5.5 (I do not know about 5.0).\n\norg.apache.ajp.tomcat4.Ajp13Connector was only one attribute\n   secret=\"secret_word\"\n\nIt might be a good idea to add a line for these 2 attributes even if just simply refer to the jk documentation.\n\nThanks - Fred"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This has been fixed intrunk and proposed for 6.0.x and 5.5.x.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 44715, "id": 115162, "time": "2008-03-31T15:20:45Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-03-31T15:20:45Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44715, "is_private": false, "text": "This has been fixed for 6.0.x and will be in 6.0.17 onwards.", "id": 115614, "time": "2008-04-15T10:12:51Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-04-15T10:12:51Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44715, "is_private": false, "id": 119133, "creation_time": "2008-07-30T10:54:08Z", "time": "2008-07-30T10:54:08Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "This has been fixed in 5.5.x and will be included in 5.5.27 onwards.", "attachment_id": null}]
