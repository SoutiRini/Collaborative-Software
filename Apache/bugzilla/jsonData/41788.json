Unfortunately the failures are essentially silent; I\ndon't see anything in the GUI.  I would like the option of having the JMeter GUI\nprovide a log viewer, much like the console viewer in Eclipse, and have that\nviewer contain all the lines that JMeter merrily writes to its jmeter.log file.\n This would be an enormous help for beginners like me.  This option could be off\nby default if that helps for performance reasons.  I agree with your approach of\nnever having the GUI put up an error dialog, of course not, but a viewer would\nbe great.
