I would like to use a truststore file other than the JDK's cacerts when I \nuse the deployer utility for command-line deploy/undeploy/start/stop/list etc \nover HTTPS.\n\nI do not find any documentation for doing that. Perhaps there is a JVM \nargument that I need to specify. Something like  -\nDjavax.net.ssl.TrustStore=/home/tomcat55/etc/trust.jks.\n\nThe example above is a fictitious one. That does not work. It is for making my \nobjective clear. Can you please point me in the right direction ?

But I \nam talking about my client deployer. I doubt if my client deployer (for \ndeploying, undeploying, list etc using deployer package from command-line) \nwill read the server.xml . In some cases these clients may be on different \nhosts than the one where Tomcat server is running on.\n\nIf I have misunderstood, please can you elaborate ?\n\nRegards\n\nAtanu Mukherjee", "id": 79741, "time": "2005-09-09T20:34:52Z", "creator": "atanu.mukherjee@jpmorgan.com", "creation_time": "2005-09-09T20:34:52Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Atanu, if I have understood your request correctly, it is not currently\npossible.
