Of course you could argue\nthat OWA should just produce clean relative links - but we're talking Microsoft\nhere ;-)\n\nAnyway, some of the other proxy servers on the market (M$ ISA and F5 BigIP) have\nan option to add HTTP headers to proxy requests, so why not Apache?\n\nCould such a feature be added to mod_proxy?
