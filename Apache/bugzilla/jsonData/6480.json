A servlet aliased hello takes the request \nand when I try to print the HttpServletRequest.getPathInfo() and \nHttpServletRequest.getPathTranslated() it prints \nPath Info             ==>>  /empty.txt\nTranslated Path Info  ==>> D:\\Program Files\\Apache Tomcat 4.0\n\\webapps\\ROOT\\hello\\empty.txt\n\nwhich is correct and when I do this again for a second attempt I get a \ndifferent Output\n\nPath Info             ==>>  /empty.txt\nTranslated Path Info  ==>>   D:\\Program Files\\Apache Tomcat 4.0\n\\webapps\\ROOT\\empty.txt\n\nI don't understand why it gives me correct path the very first time and \ndifferent wrong path the next time I do the same. I have the directory \nstructure set up under ROOT\\hello\\empty.txt. I am not sure If I am doing \nsomething wrong or if this a BUG.\n\nIf you need more info I can send the files under my ROOT directories.\n\nthanks\nAmar.", "id": 10742, "time": "2002-02-15T04:52:26Z", "creator": "matteyamar@msn.com", "creation_time": "2002-02-15T04:52:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "For HEAD branch, fixed in nightly build 20020216.\n\nFor 4.0.x branch, will be fixed in 4.0.3.\n\n\nNOTE 1:  It is the *second* value that is correct, not the first, because the \nvalue is interpreted as relative to the current context.  It's the same value \nyou will receive if you use a <servlet-mapping> to access the servlet, and call \ngetPathInfo() and getPathTranslated() from within it.\n\nNOTE 2:  Using file I/O to access static resources within a web application is \nnot portable to environments where a web application is run directly from a WAR \nfile (in this case, there is no file path at all).
