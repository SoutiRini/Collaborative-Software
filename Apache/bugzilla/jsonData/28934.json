A Jakarta site search provides no help but the \naforementioned instructions document.\nMy enhancement request is to improve one's ability to locate files on the \nJakarta site by providing an index and valid links to specific files that \npurport to exist, particularly within the Tomcat 3.2 binary distribution \nlocations. \nSincerely,\nCaroline"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28934, "attachment_id": null, "id": 57320, "time": "2004-05-13T00:18:56Z", "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "creation_time": "2004-05-13T00:18:56Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Both Tomcat 3.2.x and jk_nt_service are currently unsupported.
