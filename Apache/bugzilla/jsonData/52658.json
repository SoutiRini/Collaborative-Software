Searching on the net, I only found out that it's was simply not implemented.\n\nhttp://apache-poi.1045710.n5.nabble.com/HSLF-merging-tablecells-possible-td2294865.html\n\nI made a quick patch in the XSLFTableCell class to expose the 'gridSpan', 'rowSpan', 'hMerge' and 'vMerge' attributes of the \"tc\" element (the table cell node in the OOXML schema) and added a method in the XSLFTable class to merge the desired cells :\n  public void mergeCells(int firstRow, int lastRow, int firstCol, int lastCol);\n\nIn the client code :\n\n   XSLFTable table = newSlide.createTable();\n   ...\n   XSLFTableRow row = table.addRow();\n   ....\n   table.mergeCells(0, 1, 0, 1);\n\nNote : You need the full OOXML-schemas jar file (16 MB) to make the (Powerpoint) table work in POI.  The lite version don't seem to work for me.\n\nDue to project rush I only implemented what I need and didn't review side effect s or alternative uses (exemple : merge all the cell in the table, unmerge cells, etc ?)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52658, "attachment_id": 28325, "is_private": false, "id": 153757, "time": "2012-02-13T23:24:15Z", "creator": "dgen2@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-02-13T23:24:15Z", "text": "Created attachment 28325\nSVN Diff created by the \"ant -f patch\" command"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52658, "attachment_id": null, "id": 153762, "time": "2012-02-14T07:03:21Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2012-02-14T07:03:21Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Patch applied in r1243793\n\nThanks,\nYegor"}]
