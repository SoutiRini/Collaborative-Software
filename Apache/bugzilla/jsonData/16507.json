The RemoteHost valve\nuses the jakarta-regexp API, you can look at the docs for it to find\nout what regexp's can be used.\n\nFor example a '.' in a regexp means match any single character.\nTo match a period in a string the '.' has to be escaped as '\\.'.\nAlso '*' means match 0 to N number of times on the previous\ncharacter or expression.  So '.*' would match any character,\nany number of times.  In your case, a leading '*' caused the\nregexp to fail because there was no previous character.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nPatches to the documentation are welcome. :-)", "id": 30199, "time": "2003-01-28T19:56:30Z", "creator": "glenn@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-01-28T19:56:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 53550, "time": "2004-03-06T10:59:32Z", "bug_id": 16507, "creation_time": "2004-03-06T10:59:32Z", "text": "I have updated the documentation for TC4 and TC5."}, {"text": "*** Bug 28366 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "tags": [], "bug_id": 16507, "is_private": false, "count": 3, "id": 60611, "time": "2004-07-14T20:55:51Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-07-14T20:55:51Z", "attachment_id": null}]
