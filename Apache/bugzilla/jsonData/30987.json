Please note that I don't have\ndirect CVS access and so cannot generate a diff. I enclose the SignJar.java\nfile, downloaded on sept 1 of 2004, patched in two hours and enclosed here. The\nimportant lines are the if at the end of the doOneJar method, and of course the\nsetter of the attribute. Anyway, whomever can make a diff will see the changes.\n\nCould you please include the fix into the next release? The point is, we need to\ndeploy a signed JWS application, and the jar timestamp is used to check if the\nrevision has changed. So, we wanted to not modify the timestamp if we simply\nsign the jar again.\n\nThanks.
