[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56115, "attachment_id": null, "text": "In trying to build at work, when the ant process pulls dependencies for Tomcat, it would often hang and timeout, failing at that particular download.\n\nI debugged some and realized that it was due to default value of get's \"usehttpcaches\" property set to true.  I edited the build file's trydownload target to be this:\n\n  <target name=\"trydownload\" if=\"trydownload.run\" depends=\"trydownload.check\">\n    <!-- Downloads a file if not yet downloaded and the source URL is available -->\n    <get src=\"${sourcefile}\" retries=\"${trydownload.retries}\" httpusecaches=\"${trydownload.httpusecaches}\" dest=\"${destfile}\" />\n  </target>\n\nand I added these in build.properties.default:\n\ntrydownload.retries=3\ntrydownload.httpusecaches=false\n\nThis would keep the default behavior implied with ant's get task.  Then I overrode that httpusecaches value in my build.properties file, and it reliably works all the time.  I left the retries value as it didn't change my results but thought it could prove useful for others.", "id": 172931, "time": "2014-02-06T22:08:42Z", "creator": "mar009999@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-02-06T22:08:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mar009999@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": 31289, "id": 172932, "time": "2014-02-06T22:14:24Z", "bug_id": 56115, "creation_time": "2014-02-06T22:14:24Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 31289\nChange of trydownload target in build.xml"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56115, "attachment_id": 31290, "text": "Created attachment 31290\nAdditional default properties to add to build.properties.default", "id": 172933, "time": "2014-02-06T22:15:00Z", "creator": "mar009999@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-02-06T22:15:00Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56115, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks for the report and the suggested change.
