I first thought Kin-Man was wrong on this, but he's right.You used to be able to do this up to 1.3, but in 1.4 they have tightened upthe compiler. According to http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/compatibility.html:>The compiler now rejects import statements that import a type from the >unnamed namespace. Previous versions of the compiler would accept such import >declarations, even though they were arguably not allowed by the language >(because the type name appearing in the import clause is not in scope). The >specification is being clarified to state clearly that you cannot have a >simple name in an import statement, nor can you import from the unnamed >namespace. >To summarize, the syntax >import SimpleName;>is no longer legal. Nor is the syntax >import ClassInUnnamedNamespace.Nested;>which would import a nested class from the unnamed namespace. To fix such >problems in your code, move all of the classes from the unnamed namespace >into a named namespace.
