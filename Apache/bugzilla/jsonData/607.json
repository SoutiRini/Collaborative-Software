Dependency\non target placement within the source build file is a poor\nalgorithm for dependency execution, and prohibits simplified\nlisting of subtasks, and then a task executing them in the\ncorrect order. Currently the only way to do this would be to\nshift targets in the build file to order them carefully and\nthen execute all of them, or design the build in a hierarchical\nfashion and only have one dependency for each target. The current\nAnt documentation indicates that ordering is respected, and I\nhave tested by moving targets in the build file and this\nchanges ordering of the build."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 607, "attachment_id": null, "id": 682, "time": "2001-02-14T09:18:40Z", "creator": "glennm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-02-14T09:18:40Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The following build file executes in the correct order:\n\n---\n<project name=\"test_order\" default=\"order\">\n  <target name=\"order2\">\n  </target>\n\n  <target name=\"order1\">\n  </target>\n\n  <target name=\"order\">\n  </target>\n</project>\n---\n\nThe resulting output is\n\n---\nBuildfile: build.xml\n\norder1:\n\norder2:\n\norder:\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFULL\n\nTotal time: 0 seconds.\n---\n\nIf Ant behaved the way you describe, then the result should have been \n\n---\nBuildfile: build.xml\n\norder2:\n\norder1:\n\norder:\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFULL\n\nTotal time: 0 seconds.\n--"}]
