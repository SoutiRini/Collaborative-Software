(The pkg_distribution target is conditional and only runs if ant is built on a Mac OS X host.)"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "antoine@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 171888, "time": "2013-12-23T04:46:59Z", "bug_id": 55899, "creation_time": "2013-12-23T04:46:59Z", "tags": [], "text": "you contribution is added in revision 1553066.\nDo we want to distribute the installer systematically with new versions of Ant ?
