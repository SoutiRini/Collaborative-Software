The task allows companies\nusing clearcase to easily generate a html log of changes between the\ncurrent build and the prior build. The file can then be posted somewhere\nor emailed to QA team for appropriate regression testing. \n\nThe task receives two labels. The idea is that each build should be\nlabeled. \nThis allows you to compare two labels for file versions present in one\nbut not in the other. For each file, the task then retrieves the\ncomments used to checkin the selected file. The result is an HTML\ndocument listing all the files changed between builds along with their\ncomments. \n\nVadim", "id": 34274, "time": "2003-04-01T19:49:52Z", "bug_id": 18581, "creation_time": "2003-04-01T19:49:52Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "vpertsov@cme.com", "text": "Created attachment 5589\nIncludes the source, description, and an example changelog.", "id": 34275, "time": "2003-04-01T19:52:01Z", "bug_id": 18581, "creation_time": "2003-04-01T19:52:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 5589}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18581, "text": "I've submitted this task awhile back, and haven't heard much.
