[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 34811\nAn improved view of the table with grouped column headers\n\nI found it quite confusing to read the table of the top 5 errors by sampler when there are various types of errors occuring in the test.\n\nI have suggested a slightly modified example of the table in the attachment. I hope these changes will make the table easier to digest and follow.\n\nThe idea is group the name of the error in the column headers and just have the #Errors below that, instead of duplicating the errors each time. This will free up space in the table and make it clearer I think.\n\nThank you for JMeter!\n\n---\n\nAdditionally I opened a ticket regarding a bug in the table...\nhttps://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60840", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 60841, "id": 197562, "time": "2017-03-09T10:32:15Z", "creator": "alexander.barker@interactivedata.com", "creation_time": "2017-03-09T10:32:15Z", "attachment_id": 34811}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60841, "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to Alex from comment #0)\n> Created attachment 34811 [details]\n> An improved view of the table with grouped column headers\n> \n> I found it quite confusing to read the table of the top 5 errors by sampler\n> when there are various types of errors occuring in the test.\n> \n> I have suggested a slightly modified example of the table in the attachment.\n> I hope these changes will make the table easier to digest and follow.\n> \n> The idea is group the name of the error in the column headers and just have\n> the #Errors below that, instead of duplicating the errors each time.
