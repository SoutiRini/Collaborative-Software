When Tomcat first starts up, all the webapps (including\n/examples, which I've been testing with) start up fine. When I click 'reload' to\nreload the /examples webapp, the manager claims it is not running (false). When\nI hit 'Start' I get:\n\nFAIL - Application at context path /examples could not be started\nFAIL - Encountered exception java.lang.IllegalStateException: standardHost.start\n/examples: LifecycleException:  Container StandardContext[/examples] has already\nbeen started\n\nWhich is quite obviously not true, since when I try to access /examples I get\n\nHTTP Status 503 - This application is not currently available\n\nThe only way to bring /examples back is to shutdown.sh then startup.sh.\n\nI'm posting this under the manager, although I'm not sure whether the problem\nlies there or not; I tried moving the manager webapp from 4.1.24\n(tomcat_home/server/webapps/manager) into 4.1.27 and had the same problem.\n\nUsing Sun JDK 1.4.1_03. I've tried this on 3 systems (different versions of\nSuSE) and all three show the same problem.
