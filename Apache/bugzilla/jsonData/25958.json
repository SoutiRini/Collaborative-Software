[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 25958, "attachment_id": null, "text": "We have webapp using encoding UTF-8 for all pages. It is set in jsp header and \nin meta tag in header. We use filter wrapping the whole application and setting \nrequest.setCharacterEncoding(\"UTF-8\"); When we send data from FORM via POST \nmethod, everything is OK, but if we change method to GET, data is badly encoded. \nWe tested it with characters from iso-8859-2 and iso-8859-5 codepage. For \nexample, czech characters \u010d\u017e\u0161\u010d\u017e are encoded as %c4%8d%c5%be%c5%a1%c4%8d%c5%be, \nit looks like well urlencoded UTF data, and when we sniffed data posted via POST \nmethod, it was the same. This problem occures if you use such data in parameters \nof link too. We post this problem to our local java mailing list and a few \npeople confirmed the same behavior, so it looks it is not only our problem.\n\nUsed configuration:\n\nClients: Win IE 6.0, Mozilla 1.4, Opera 7.21\nServer OS: Windows 2000, Linux\nContainer: Tomcat 5.0.16\nJava: J2SDK 1.4.2_03", "id": 50194, "time": "2004-01-07T16:08:13Z", "creator": "ondra@matfyz.cz", "creation_time": "2004-01-07T16:08:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 50195, "time": "2004-01-07T16:13:15Z", "bug_id": 25958, "creation_time": "2004-01-07T16:13:15Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 23929 ***"}]
