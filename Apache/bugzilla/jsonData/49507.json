Due to the nature of the application we would not like everyone to access the site. So we decided that we use SSL and client certificates to authenticate users. We are using JRE 1.5.0_16. I have created server certificate and my HTTPS is working fine. I dont have any idea how to configure client certifcates so that my web application is accessible where the certificates are installed on the web brower. \n\nPlease help me guide with this.\n\nThanks\nDeepak"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
