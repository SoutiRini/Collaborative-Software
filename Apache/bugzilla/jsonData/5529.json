My problem is that i can't generate a report \nif the xml file size exceeds 480KB, but a pdf is genrated with a XML file whose \nsize is below 480KB. When a file exceeds this range a \".pdf.tmp\" file is \ncreated which is quite huge and though the process continues in the background, \non the client side after some time, a \"page not found\" error is displayed.\n(There is no change in the xsl file.)\n  What i need is ..i should be able to genrate reports where the dynamically \ncreated XML file size exceeds 480KB..maybe a xml of size 1MB. \n  Can anyone suggest on how do i proceed? Any help will be appreciated..", "id": 9078, "time": "2001-12-20T02:27:57Z", "bug_id": 5529, "creation_time": "2001-12-20T02:27:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 1063 ***", "is_private": false, "id": 14247, "creator": "j3322ptm@yahoo.de", "time": "2002-04-22T08:55:42Z", "bug_id": 5529, "creation_time": "2002-04-22T08:55:42Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs", "is_private": false, "id": 156495, "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "time": "2012-04-01T13:48:57Z", "bug_id": 5529, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:48:57Z", "attachment_id": null}]
