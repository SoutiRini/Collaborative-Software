Some are likely to be defects with the Gentoo \ndistribution of Tomcat5, and at least one of the defects (documented below) is \nin Catalina.

The JAR \nfile is in the $CATALINA_HOME/bin folder, and looking at the table of contents \nreveals the class that jsvc cannot find.\n\nAlso, it may still be worthwhile to look at the Gentoo installation issues, \nbecause the ./configure script that comes packaged with Tomcat fails when \nuname -m returns \"ppc64\"."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30568, "attachment_id": null, "id": 62849, "time": "2004-08-31T14:23:57Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2004-08-31T14:23:57Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I don't have a Gentoo system to test.
