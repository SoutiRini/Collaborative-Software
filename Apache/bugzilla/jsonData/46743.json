The documentation does not address these issues, but I would argue that my expectations are more reasonable than the current behavior because they are consistent with the behavior if the subdirectory has no mod_rewrite configuration at all.\n\n1. Inherited rules are interpreted with respect to the subdirectory (meaning that the subdirectory's per-dir prefix is stripped and RewriteBase is added).  I would expect each rule to always be interpreted with respect to the directory that defined it, so that the meaning of a \"^\" anchor in a rule pattern is consistent.  (The original post includes a demonstration.)\n\n2. If a directory is requested without a trailing slash, rewriting is completely skipped.  It makes sense to skip the directory's own rules to avoid bug 20195, but I think inherited rules should still run.  Otherwise, there's no way to rewrite the request short of moving the entire mod_rewrite configuration to the parent htaccess file.", "id": 125012, "time": "2009-02-19T21:19:56Z", "creator": "matt@mattmccutchen.net", "creation_time": "2009-02-19T21:19:56Z", "is_private": false}]
