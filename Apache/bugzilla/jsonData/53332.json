Because of the spec, conforming backends don't read any of the body of the request.\nConveniently, as mod_fcgid already buffers the entire request, it is relatively straightforward to adjust so that this is set.\nAttached is a patch to support this - tested under httpd 2.2.22, mod_fcgid 2.3.6 on Linux x86.", "id": 159539, "time": "2012-05-30T18:25:52Z", "creator": "dominic.benson@thirdlight.com", "creation_time": "2012-05-30T18:25:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ku@digitaldolphins.jp", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I'm sure that the Dominic Benson's patch is useful and worth considering.\n\nCurrently sending raw-body with \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" over mod_fcgid has problems:\n- file_get_contents('php://input') always return 0 bytes.\n- blocks http response, although php script finished.\n- apache logs \"mod_fcgid: write timeout to pipe\"\n\nraw-body is a non-form data such as \"application/octet-stream\".\n\nproblem on: Apache/2.4.20 (Win32) mod_fcgid/2.3.9 + PHP 7.0.6\n\nThe patch can fix these problems.\n\nSomeone already reported this to php.
