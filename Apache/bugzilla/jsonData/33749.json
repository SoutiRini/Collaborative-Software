Not much past, to be sure, but it did go past. \n\nI did, however, get the cvs-snapshot (with only a small amount of cussing and\nscreeching) to compile and, unless there is some well hidden flaw, I seem to be\n'good to go'.", "id": 71558, "time": "2005-02-26T04:24:51Z", "creator": "tfeldman@lclink.com", "creation_time": "2005-02-26T04:24:51Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mxmanghi@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 162111, "time": "2012-09-12T14:54:28Z", "bug_id": 33749, "creation_time": "2012-09-12T14:54:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bug related to an old and now unsupported release of Rivet"}]
