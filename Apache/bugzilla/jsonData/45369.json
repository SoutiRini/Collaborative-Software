Render it into xml (intermediate format). Then create a PDF version (or whatever) out of the xml file. The footnote will be found at the top of the page.\n\nThe problem is that the XML renderer doesn't store the offset of the footnote area from the top of the region-body. And the AreaTreeParser doesn't parse any such attribute in return.\n\nThe attached patch should fix the issue, but I'd prefer a Renderer/Area Tree specialist to review it in order to check that it fits well into the big picture, before committing it.\n\n\nThanks,\nVincent", "id": 118413, "time": "2008-07-09T10:07:54Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-07-09T10:07:54Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Looks perfect, Vincent. +1 to committing the patch as is.
