The reason for this is\nthat once returning from the iReplaceTokens method the current (parent) token\nshould be removed from the passedTokens Vector.  The passedTokens vector should\nbe used like a stack always popping the current token as you leave the method.\n\nA work around that currently works is to define multiple discrete filtersets\nsplitting the token that appears multiple times into its own filterset.
