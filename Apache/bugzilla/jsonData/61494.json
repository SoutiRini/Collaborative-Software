Very likely this is a duplicate of bug 54084, which itself depends on a fix in the XMLBeans library, see bug 59268 all the details.\n\nThere is an updated test-version of the XMLBeans library available at http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.pjfanning/xmlbeans/2.6.2, using this one makes this work for me, independent of writing custom/core properties or not. So you might be able to use this library instead of xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar.\n\nSo this bug is a duplicate and will be fixed when we can get an updated version of XMLBeans made available officially.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 59268 ***", "bug_id": 61494, "is_private": false, "id": 201047, "time": "2017-09-21T16:10:10Z", "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2017-09-21T16:10:10Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61494, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks, it works with xmlbeans-2.6.2", "id": 201065, "time": "2017-09-22T05:17:59Z", "creator": "ak.azad@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-09-22T05:17:59Z", "is_private": false}]
