I'd like backup files to be saved in a different folder than the current one.\n\nThe problem I am having, is that it only works when destination directory of backup files is already created. When backup directory does not exists, then rollover is skipped.\n\nI debugged code and realized that the problem may be solved if the backup folder is created in FileRenameAction\n\nJust change the method execute in FileRenameAction to:\n\n  public static boolean execute(\n    final File source, final File destination, boolean renameEmptyFiles) {\n    if (renameEmptyFiles || (source.length() > 0)) {\n    \tFile destinationParent = destination.getParentFile();\n    \tif (!destinationParent.exists()) {\n    \t\tdestinationParent.mkdirs();\n    \t}\n      return source.renameTo(destination);\n    }\n\n    return source.delete();\n  }", "id": 172418, "time": "2014-01-16T12:54:11Z", "creator": "roberjruiz@yahoo.es", "creation_time": "2014-01-16T12:54:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
