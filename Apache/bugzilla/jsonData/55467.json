The attached patch adds optional functions and optional hooks to mod_ssl which exposes these APIs for use in other modules.\n\nThe patch also provides an optional hook supporting notification of handshake completion.  Returning OK from this hook will result in renegotiation.  Returning DECLINED will not result in renegotiation.  An optional function is also provided which allows modules to initiate renegotiation as needed.\n\nThe patch is created against the 2.4.x github repository\n\ngit hash 1f88c41c1eacd0a24ecd642f20050ed5cc2ac170\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x@1516", "id": 169644, "time": "2013-08-21T21:18:36Z", "creator": "sdeboy@iname.com", "creation_time": "2013-08-21T21:18:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sdeboy@iname.com", "text": "The custom TLS extension API is available in the OpenSSL master git branch.
