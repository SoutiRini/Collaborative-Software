[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 51491, "text": "The HTTP spec *requires* a user agent to use GET or HEAD in a redirected request if it is not using user interaction to confirm otherwise. (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3)\n\nA redirect of a POST not ending in a / is therefore likely to corrupt the intent of the request, or at the very best result in an ungainly request for user interaction.\n\nTherefore I believe mod_dir should be configured by default *NOT* to redirect POST requests.\n\nThis is encountered quite often and without reasonable workarounds IMO when using a framework such as Sling where POST requests to a directory with a trailing / mean something usefully different from a request without a trailing /.\n\nYes it can be made to work by explictly disabling or configuring DirectorySlash off for the relevant URLs. But other uses of the same URL prefix may benefit from DirectorySlash. And configuration of Apache shouldn't be needed to avoid a behavior that is more often than not disruptive.", "id": 147840, "time": "2011-07-08T19:58:35Z", "creator": "eboregelna@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-07-08T19:58:35Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
