Due to the fact that the new backend is not under load a load of initial request are proxie dto the new backend and will come back with failures because the web container is not available.\n\nThere are some features like configure timeouts to disable the worker for an amount of minutes until the web-container is completly loaded, but this does not really satisify my needs, because it's  more like a work around. \n\nA better solution would be to enable the balancer to first check if the url, the client requests is available and gives a correct 200 before the apache proxies the request to the backend. This feature can maybe be activated based on a balancer-member property i.e. \"checkurl=on\".\n\nThe check could by done everytime, after a configured timeout (like every 60s) and at least at the point a new balancer-member is recognized before the first request gets proxied to this backend.\n\nI.e. an additional property like \"checktimeout=60\", which means the URL-Check is done every 60 seconds for this URL (0s could mean, before every request). And as basic feature the URl check is done every time an new balancer-member has been added for an backend \"checkurl\" is activated.\n\nBest regards,\nAndr\u00e9", "id": 178193, "time": "2014-09-30T06:48:23Z", "creator": "andre.wendel@bmw.de", "creation_time": "2014-09-30T06:48:23Z", "is_private": false}]
