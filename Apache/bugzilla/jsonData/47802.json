Added a response assertion to a HTTP request to analyse if the text Pattern specified is contained in the returning page.\n2. Regular expression ${ExpectedResult} was used to define the text pattern I am looking for.\n3. The value of this expression was set to pick up the second entry in a comma flat file.\n4. The test is simply reading a flat (comma) file and searching on the first entry through Google. It then checks to see if the returned page contains the text in ${ExpectedResult} and fail if the result is false.\n5. This works for search criteria \"Duck\" but not \"Elephant\".\n\nI have attached the script and comma flat file I am using so you could run the test for yourself to re-produce the failure.\n\nLook forward to your solution & Thanks in advance.\n\nRegards.", "id": 130211, "time": "2009-09-08T08:57:20Z", "bug_id": 47802, "creation_time": "2009-09-08T08:57:20Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 24227, "creator": "charnjit.bhullar@cardifpinnacle.com", "is_private": false, "id": 130212, "time": "2009-09-08T09:00:23Z", "bug_id": 47802, "creation_time": "2009-09-08T09:00:23Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 24227\nScript & CSV File"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "The Google response for Elephant does not contain the text:\n\nElephants are large\n\nIt contains the text:\n\n<em>Elephants</em> are large\n\nso no wonder the Assertion fails.", "is_private": false, "id": 130267, "creation_time": "2009-09-09T16:13:39Z", "time": "2009-09-09T16:13:39Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "bug_id": 47802, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47802, "text": "Thank You.\n\nI was looking at the rendered HTML response, I will ensure that I look at the HTML code in the future.\n\nVerified as Invalid Bug.\n\nI am not sure about your procedures, does the reporter (Myself) or the JMeter developer (yourself) updates the status to closed after verification has been confirmed ?", "id": 130283, "time": "2009-09-10T05:57:35Z", "creator": "charnjit.bhullar@cardifpinnacle.com", "creation_time": "2009-09-10T05:57:35Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "Normally the JMeter team will close bugs, but for invalid ones it could also be the originator.\n\nI'll close it.", "id": 130290, "time": "2009-09-10T09:22:33Z", "bug_id": 47802, "creation_time": "2009-09-10T09:22:33Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
