For instance, you may\nwant to let webmasters override some of the Options category, but not all of it.\n Most often, you might want to restrict ExecCGI or Includes, but otherwise, give\ncontroll to the webmaster.  This can be done with the following:\n\n<Directory />\nAllowOverride All\n</Directory>\n\n<Location />\nOptions +IncludesNoEXEC -ExecCGI\n</Location>\n\nSince Location supercedes Directory and htaccess settings, this effectively\ngives control of a subset of the Options category to htaccess users.  I think\nthis is a fairly common thing to want to do, so making a note of it somewhere in\nthe documentation would be a nice addition."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31782, "attachment_id": null, "id": 74406, "time": "2005-05-03T21:55:37Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-05-03T21:55:37Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for the interesting example.
