The consequence is that if this DirContext is taken from a Pool of connection, you pretty quickly exhaust this pool, as the connction will be back into the available connections only when they timeout (an dthe default timeout is 30s, from the top of my head).\n\nThis is explicitely said on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/ldap/close.html :\n\n\"You invoke Context.close() on a Context instance to indicate that you no longer need to use it. If the Context instance being closed is using a dedicated connection, the connection is also closed. If the Context instance is sharing a connection with other Context and unterminated NamingEnumeration instances, the connection will not be closed until close() has been invoked on all such Context and NamingEnumeration instances.\"\n\nor in https://blogs.oracle.com/moazam/entry/jndi_connections_not_closing_remember", "id": 189130, "time": "2016-03-05T10:57:56Z", "bug_id": 59123, "creation_time": "2016-03-05T10:57:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": 33625, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59123, "text": "Created attachment 33625\nExplicitly close NamingEnumerations after usage", "count": 1, "id": 189142, "time": "2016-03-05T18:11:21Z", "creator": "felix.schumacher@internetallee.de", "creation_time": "2016-03-05T18:11:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59123, "text": "Thanks for the report.\n\nI've applied Felix's patch to 9.0.x (for 9.0.0.M4 onwards), 8.0.x (for 8.0.33 onwards) and 7.0.x (for 7.0.69 onwards).
