The description for the Scp task contains the following security note:\n\n> Security Note: Hard coding passwords and/or usernames in scp task can be a \n> serious security hole. Consider using variable substitution and include the \n> password on the command line. For example:\n>\n>     <scp todir=\"${username}:${password}@host:/dir\" ...>\n>\n> Invoking ant with the following command line:\n>\n>     ant -Dusername=me -Dpassword=mypassword target1 target2\n>\n> Is slightly better, but the username/password is exposed to all users on a\n> Unix system (via the ps command). The best approach is to use the <input> task > and/or retrieve the password from a (secured) .properties file.  \n\nI think this clearly describes all options with their respective weaknesses.  I think the Sshexec task should contain a similar hint."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43941, "attachment_id": null, "text": "done in svn revision 677222", "id": 118700, "time": "2008-07-16T02:57:47Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-07-16T02:57:47Z", "is_private": false}]
