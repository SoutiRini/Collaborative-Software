In \nStarTeam (as of version 4.2), the Promotion State is an object which allows \nyou to have a dynamic pointer to a build label.  Common names for promotion \nstates are \"Unit Test Ready\" or \"Integration Test Ready\" etc.  Using promotion \nstates is the best way to use StarTeam in a consistent manner, since you don't \nhave to keep updating your Ant script or Properties files to include a \nspecific build number.  The code from this Ant task is simply missing the \nnecessary methods and parameters to check out by promotion state.  I have \ncreated an alternate version of these tasks and would like to submit them for \ninclusion in the next Ant release.
