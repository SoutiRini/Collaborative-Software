[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 39248, "text": "I've tried to use a the saxon transformer factory inside of the xslt task and to\nload it from the classpath. because of some other needs i cannot store the\nsaxon8.jar into the lib folder of the ant dist. i've tried to set the classpath\ninside of the xslt task and i also defined the factory to use. but the only\nclass that was loaded using the classpath is the TraXLiason. As the TraXLiason\nlies in the lib folder of ant dist the class is loaded with the\nparentclassloader of the special defined classpath (loader). Now the real\nProblem is that the factory is loaded with the same classloader as the\nTraXLiason and not with the defined classpath loader. If the XSLTProcess sets\nthe the defined classpath into the TraXLiason and the classpath is used the load\nthe factory it would be much easier to use \"external\" factories. I know that the\ndevelopment of my own TraXLiason can solve the Problem but it would be much\neasier just to define a classpath...\n\nThanx for hearing", "id": 87689, "time": "2006-04-07T21:41:39Z", "creator": "surfer@kalto.de", "creation_time": "2006-04-07T21:41:39Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "surfer@kalto.de", "is_private": false, "text": "I haven't seen the older enhancement request\n\nthanx surfer\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 29596 ***", "id": 87702, "time": "2006-04-08T11:24:13Z", "bug_id": 39248, "creation_time": "2006-04-08T11:24:13Z", "attachment_id": null}]
