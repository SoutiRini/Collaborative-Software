This bug would be very \neasy to fix, so I am reporting it to help improve the software.\n\nTomcat does not display images (icons) when the images located in \"jakarta-\ntomcat-5.0.19\\webapps\\<app-name>\\images\" directory (and it's subdirectories) \nhave filename extensions that are capitalized (e.g., \"icon.GIF\" \nversus \"icon.gif\"). This only applies to the windows version, since windows \nfilenames are not case sensitive.\n\nOther servlet engines, such as Resin, display image files properly regardless \nof the case of the filename extension. This should be an easy fix that will \nbring Tomcat closer to the capabilities of some of the commercial servlet \nengines.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBM"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27782, "attachment_id": null, "id": 54245, "time": "2004-03-18T22:31:13Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-03-18T22:31:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Case sensitivity is the norm in HTTP land.\nPlease do not reopen the bug."}]
