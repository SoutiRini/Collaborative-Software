It doesn't happen \nall of the time, and is very difficult to reproduce.  Our logs files display \nthe following line:\n[ERROR] Error while creating area : Error while recovering Image Informations \n(file:/prod/folio/p1/config/common/img/logo_big.jpg) : Stream closed\n\nThe file does exist (and has the necessary file permissions), and most of the \ntime it is included on in the PDF without any problems.  We generate a large \nnumber of PDFs during a batch process when this happens, usually a couple \nhundred of them.  We run 4 threads at once to generate them, all running within \na shared weblogic context (version 5.1).  I am not sure if this is a threading \nissue or not.  Any ideas how to resolve this?  Or at the very least, are there \nany ways that I can identify when this occurs so that we can at least try and \nregenerate it (the exception is currently just logged, and the report is \ngenerated without any errors being thrown).", "id": 38610, "time": "2003-06-09T18:31:30Z", "bug_id": 20621, "creation_time": "2003-06-09T18:31:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20621, "attachment_id": null, "id": 38613, "time": "2003-06-09T18:51:51Z", "creator": "j3322ptm@yahoo.de", "creation_time": "2003-06-09T18:51:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "0.20.4 was not thread safe in this respect.
