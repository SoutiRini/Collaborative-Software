Thus, when one attempts to build a rewritemap module with apxs, things fail horribly. This is obviously easy enough to work around in various ways, but given that other modules have their header files in $installdir/include, such workarounds shouldn't be needed. The attached one-line patch resolves this issue."}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 22285\nDiff to Makefile.in to copy mod_rewrite.h to the $installdir/include", "bug_id": 45438, "attachment_id": 22285, "id": 118840, "time": "2008-07-19T21:22:43Z", "creator": "noah.robin@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-07-19T21:22:43Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45438, "attachment_id": null, "id": 172495, "creation_time": "2014-01-19T19:12:18Z", "time": "2014-01-19T19:12:18Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "text": "fixed in 2.2.11", "is_private": false}]
