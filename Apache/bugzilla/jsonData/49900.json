Profiling reveals large memory usage in org.apache.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl objects.\n\nI believe this is because org.apache.taglibs.standard.tag.common.fmt.BundleTagSupport does not call super.release() from it's release() method.  The superclass, BodyTagSupport, nulls the reference to bodyContent in it's release() method. \n\nThe BundleTag instances are pooled by the container, so in between requests the most recent bodyContent cannot be garbage collected.
