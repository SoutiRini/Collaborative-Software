I \ndont use html pages, therefore a generated directory listing is best for me.  \nBut some directories with a lot of items or subdirectories in them don't \ngenerate. Instead, Internet Explorer tells me \"The page cannot be displayed\", \nand my server error log states: \n\n[Fri Jan 24 05:05:20 2003] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no \nlonger available.  : winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.\n\nIt is important to note that if I access \"http://localhost/\" everything works \nperfectly fine. \n\nFor instance:  http://sporco.no-ip.com is my server and a root directory \nlisting will fail.  But try  http://sporco.no-ip.com/wallpaper  and the \nlisting will work there.\n\nIt seems almost as if on the failed directories that the listing begins to \ngenerate but then stops, and redirects IE to \"The page cannot be displayed.\"\n\nPlease keep in mind that this works perfectly fine on \"localhost\".  Also, I do \nnot have any .htaccess files anywhere in the failed directories, nor do I have \nany sort of Index.html files.   This bug was reproduced in version 2.0.44 as \nwell.
