I \nran into it working on my own webapp trying to take advantage of the \nreloadable=\"true\" feature of Tomcat.  While developing, I recompile often and \nit's handy not to have to restart Tomcat after every change.  I havn't testing \nthis with 4.1.24, so I don't know if this bug has just recently been introduced."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22477, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 42847, "time": "2003-08-16T12:39:45Z", "creator": "apbuteau@cc.usu.edu", "creation_time": "2003-08-16T12:39:45Z", "text": "I just did two default installs of Tomcat on WinXP (jsdk build 1.4.1_03-b02):\n\n4.1.24 - Reloadable=\"true\" worked great\n4.1.27 - reloadable=\"true\" made tomcat crash\n\n"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22477, "attachment_id": null, "id": 42849, "time": "2003-08-16T13:05:31Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-08-16T13:05:31Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This looks similar to the webapp reloading bug (bug 22096).
