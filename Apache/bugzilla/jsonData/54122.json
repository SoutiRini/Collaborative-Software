If I'm wrong in some point, let me know this point.\n\nIMHO removing this feature would be not a good solution. The fonts auto discover works well, but it really used in small desktop or special configured environments. If someone had very strict fonts requirement based on license agreements, external despondencies, etc., he really need this feature.\n\nI.e. in my own environment the fonts/metrics are hardly linked to glyphs (fonts files) and metrics using config file. I'll never be use autodiscover, because it leads to unpredictable results on final output."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54122, "is_private": false, "count": 3, "id": 163416, "time": "2012-11-13T10:54:37Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-13T10:54:37Z", "text": "Hi Edward,\n\nThanks for your response.

I agree this page needs updating but we are about to switch to a new website, so I will probably update the page in the new website or wait until we switch before addressing this. Basically the special use cases are diminished in the latest versions of FOP. I believe the use case the author had in mind was related to single byte encoding but that too is now possible without creating the metrics files. The only other possible use case for metric files is as a means to modify the metrics extracted in case the original font contains errors, but that use case is very unlikely. I will bear that in mind when I come to rewrite the help topic."}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54122, "attachment_id": null, "id": 163420, "time": "2012-11-13T12:27:21Z", "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-13T12:27:21Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I've had a go at re-organizing and re-wording the font topic on the new website that you can see here: http://xmlgraphics.staging.apache.org/fop/1.1/fonts.html"}]
