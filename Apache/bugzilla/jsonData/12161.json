That's great!\n\nI can also set the port in the HTTP Defaults config element too, so I\ncan set up each sub-group to use http on port a or https on port b.\n\nNow, how can I get 'preferences' or 'parameters' global to the Test\nPlan to affect all the sub-groups? Or affect all the sub-groups I\nwant to call 'secure' accesses (leaving the others as 'insecure')?\nI can add to the Test Plan the user variable 'httpsPort', and give\nit the value of the port, b.\n\nThrough all my HTTP Default config elements in the plan, for those\nconfig elements controlling sub-groups representing 'secure' accesses,\nI just use Port: ${httpsPort}.\n\nSo, when I want to run my test plan against a plain HTTP installation\nof my app, I can just change httpsPort to the value 'a' and get plain\nHTTP test going!\n\nBut that's not sufficient. I have to visit each HTTP Defaults config\nelement in each 'secure' sub-group and also switch the radio button to\nHTTP.\n\nIt would be very nice be able to control both the protocol (http/s) and\nthe port by simple changing a pair (or a single) user variable value\nat the top of the test plan.\n\nThis requires that the protocol not be set by a radio button selection,\nbut by a text field (perhaps with constraints on its value), and the\ntext field be able to use ${var} for its value. ${var} must of course\nexpand to a valid protocol string.\n\nHow to work this all in to this enhancement, or whether to deal with it\nas a separate enhancement, is up to the JMeter dev team.\n\nThanks for your efforts.\n"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 12161, "text": "Now that the ${variables} concept has proven successful, it's probably time to\nactually REMOVE many of those Http Defaults options by entering URLs as a single\nstring (instead of protocol+domain+port+path).
