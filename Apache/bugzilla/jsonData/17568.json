I followed the documentation \nand set up the first container to represent the main site in section 2 of the \nconfiguration file. I then set up a new one in a container following the first. \nIt did not work. I finally changed the orderof the containers and it worked. \nThis is directly opposite to what the documentation tells us to do.  In case \nyou did not understand my newbie explaination more details will follow.\n\nI originally set up my site palmplanet.net. This is the first and \"main\" site. \nI then registered another site colonsurgeon.com. I tried to set this up as a \nvirtual host. I created a container for palmplanet.net followed by a container \nfor colonsurgeon.com. As a last ditch I changed the order of the two containers \nand it worked. Is this a server bug or a documentation glitch?
