Resolve properties with the ${..} syntax, as you describe here.\n2.

Allow specification of classpaths in a properties file. \n\n2 and 3 above are enabled by a new attribute, \"semanticAttributes\" specified\nwith the xml property tag.\n\nSo, an example properties file could look like:\n<properties>\n  <build location=\"build\">\n    <classes location=\"${build}/classes\"/>\n    <test>\n      <classes location=\"${build}/testclasses\"/>\n    </test>\n  </build>\n  <classpaths>\n    <path pathid=\"project.classpath\">\n      <pathelement path=\"${java.class.path}\"/>\n      <pathelement location=\"${build.classes}\"/>\n    </path>\n    <path pathid=\"test.classpath\">\n      <pathelement refid=\"project.classpath\"/>\n      <pathelement location=\"${build.test.classes}\"/>\n    </path>\n  </classpaths>\n</properties>\n\nI'm attaching a WinZip file that contains a build file, the modified XmlProperty\nand an XmlPropertyTest that reads some provided input xml files and compares the\nresults against some expected .properties files."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "paul@priorartisans.com", "attachment_id": 3478, "text": "Created attachment 3478\nNew XmlProperty and test case", "id": 24558, "time": "2002-10-15T17:05:12Z", "bug_id": 11321, "creation_time": "2002-10-15T17:05:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "paul@priorartisans.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "This patch also includes the patch described in bug 12045.", "id": 25132, "time": "2002-10-24T15:08:11Z", "bug_id": 11321, "creation_time": "2002-10-24T15:08:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11321, "attachment_id": null, "id": 25136, "time": "2002-10-24T15:15:47Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-10-24T15:15:47Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 12045 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "OK, Paul, your patch is in in a modified form - most part are cosmetics, the\nmain change I've done is the way the location magic is triggered.
