This property\nallows subtree's of the document to be render/composed in\ncolorspaces other than sRGB.\n\nThe current patch has a few issues.\n1) It requires JDK 1.4 to function properly (it also requires\n   1.4 to compile, but the compile part should be easy to fix).\n2) It involves lying to Java2D about almost everything.  The\n   patch tells Java2D it is working in sRGB when in fact it is\n   working in what ever colorspace the user requested.  This seems\n   to be needed for two reasons.  First, if you don't do this it\n   appears to convert everything to 'sRGB' composite and covert back!\n   Second (which is probably related to first) performance.\n   As it turns out lying in this manner isn't too hard so the patch \n   works :)\n"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27248, "text": "Reassigning all open bugs to the development list.\nSorry for the mass mailing.", "id": 40384, "time": "2005-03-22T12:15:48Z", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-22T12:15:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #2)\n> 1) It requires JDK 1.4 to function properly (it also requires\n>    1.4 to compile, but the compile part should be easy to fix).\n\nUpdate: Java version 1.4 is now the minimum required so this may worth a retry...? :-)\n\nI haven't tested if the patch still applies cleanly, though: given its date, it will likely need some modification(s).", "id": 125867, "time": "2009-03-30T01:26:43Z", "bug_id": 27248, "creation_time": "2009-03-30T01:26:43Z", "attachment_id": null}]
