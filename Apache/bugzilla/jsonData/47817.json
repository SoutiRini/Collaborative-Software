Currently a single threads seems to use just only one connections to the server. To make testing more realistic a thread / user should be able to use 2 simultaneous connections to retrieve objects.\n\nFor the latest versions of Firefox it is even using up to 6 connections simultaneously. To make tests realistic, this woould definitly be a must. Especially for HTTPS it is more realistic because it involves SSL handshakes. Also many webservers are configured to hold a maximum of X connections, and when simultaneous connetions are used you would hit this twice as fast as when testing with only 1 connection (as JMeter does now).", "id": 130288, "time": "2009-09-10T08:30:17Z", "creator": "jvangaalen@computest.nl", "creation_time": "2009-09-10T08:30:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "We consider this feature very important, e.g. AJAX/GWT pages that execute commands in parralel cannot be now precisely simulated with JMeter.
