[{"count": 0, "text": "Dear Eric,\n\nin a project we needed an Apache Webserver authentication via URL. \n\nThe project is a content management system based on the Tamino\nXML-Server. Documents can be presented either in HTML or in \nPDF format, this is where FOP comes in the place.\n\nDue to security issues we protected an URL-path with Basic Authentication.\nThis lead to HTTP 401 errors when trying to get image files into the\nFOP process by an HttpRequest.\n\nWe added some lines of code to the following classes from the \npackage org.apache.fop.image:\nBmpImage \nJimiImage \nJAIImage \nJpegImage \nGifImage \nFopImageFactory\n\nWe replaced the invocation of the methods URL.getContent() and\nURL.openStream() by this code (with slight differences in either\nclass):\n\n<!--------- snip ------------>\n\njava.net.URLConnection urlCon = this.m_href.openConnection(); \nString userpass = this.m_href.getUserInfo(); \nString auth = \"Basic \" + new \n             sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(userpass.getBytes()); \nurlCon.setRequestProperty(\"Authorization\", auth); \nImageProducer ip = (ImageProducer)urlCon.getContent();\n\n<!--------- snap ------------>\n\nWe made a straight forward approch with hard encoding of our \nuser/password requirements. You should of course better replace\nthis by invocation of the URL-method getUserInfo() which returns\na colon seperated string \"user:password\". Maybe you still have\nto check whether it is null or not.\n\nThanks for your good work in the ASF, we hope this info is\nhelpful for your work!\n\nwith best regards\n\nMarko Petersen\nMalte Schnack\n\nPS: If you need the amended source files pls contact either\nMarko (mp@bitset.de) or me (ms@bitset.de)", "creator": "ms@bitset.de", "is_private": false, "id": 17822, "time": "2002-06-14T19:47:39Z", "bug_id": 9880, "creation_time": "2002-06-14T19:47:39Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9880, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 26734, "time": "2002-11-21T20:09:02Z", "creator": "oleg@tkachenko.com", "creation_time": "2002-11-21T20:09:02Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 14419 ***"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9880, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 156910, "time": "2012-04-01T13:54:50Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:54:50Z", "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs"}]
