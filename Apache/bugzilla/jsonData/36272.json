The code generated \nshould be of a standalone and should not be dependent on any other libraries. \nBasically the tool should take XML Schema or DTD Schema and generate stand \nalone parser and validation code without dependency. I think with little more \ncoding with the existing Xerces open source code can do this. The tool should \nbe able to generate c++, java and perl codes.\n\nThanks\nNandagopal J."}]
