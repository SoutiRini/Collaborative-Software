This always fails for me, but it happens ONLY when upon\nthe point of choosing merge, the Thread Group is selected.\nSo... If you have a test plan under a Thread Group with the name A and the item\nof the Thread Group is selected (albeit collapsed or not) and you merge with\nanother Test Plan, for which the Thread Group has the name B, you (or at least\nI) will end up with a test plan that contains two thread groups with the same\nname, B.\n(I realize now that I worded the bug insufficiently as I intended 'thread group'\nwhere I wrote 'test plan' -- I am so sorry)\n\n", "id": 96388, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 41078, "creation_time": "2006-11-29T22:13:25Z", "time": "2006-11-29T22:13:25Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "So it's the Thread Group NAME that is changed.\n\nYes, this does happen for me as well.
