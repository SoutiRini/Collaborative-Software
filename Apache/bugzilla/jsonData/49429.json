[{"count": 0, "text": "Created attachment 25589\nAnt 1.8.1 SSHExec.java, modified to include new parameter StripLastCharacter\n\nAs described on the ant users list in August 2009,\n\nhttp://old.nabble.com/sshexec-td24832653.html\n\noutput from sshexec includes a newline at the end.\n\nThis creates difficulties when the output is intended for later use. To give an example, I have an Ant build that needs to find a process ID. I do this with the sshexec task by executing:\n\nps -ef | grep -v grep | grep ${mysearchstring} | awk '{ print $2 }'\n\nThis gives me a process ID, but also a newline at the end, which I must then remove using a stripLastChar macrodef.\n\nIt would be far more convenient if there was an option in the sshexec task to strip this last character out of the output.\n\nAttached is a version of SSHExec.java, created by modifying Ant 1.8.1, which has this parameter and strips the last character out as required. Maybe you could consider this for inclusion in the next release of Ant?", "bug_id": 49429, "is_private": false, "id": 137579, "time": "2010-06-11T12:30:51Z", "creator": "pietari@opengamma.com", "creation_time": "2010-06-11T12:30:51Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 25589}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "it would probably be more useful and more general if the task supported a nested\nredirector like <exec> does.
