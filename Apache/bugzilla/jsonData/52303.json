Basically, a webapp that does not need to define a <login-config> is valid under the servlet 3.0 spec and therefore should be able to participate in a single signon realm. It should be able to inherit the security principal established by another webapp within the same realm. Its own <session-timeout> value should be honoured, even when all the other sessions in the same SingleSignOnEntry have expired.\n\nThe problem is with NonLoginAuthenticator - at some time it had SSO helper logic that was too primitive. This logic was completely commented-out in tomcat 6.0.0.\n\nI have two fairly simple webapps (not quite drop-ins) that demonstrate the problem and my proposed fix. I have heavily commented my proposed fix to explain the surrounding dependent logic that it relies on.\n\nAt the moment I have not found an SSO-based unit test for any of the AuthenticatorBase concrete classes, but I will try to create one (eventually).", "id": 152065, "time": "2011-12-08T09:35:59Z", "creator": "Brian@PingToo.com", "creation_time": "2011-12-08T09:35:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52303, "attachment_id": null, "id": 152427, "time": "2011-12-27T20:25:25Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-12-27T20:25:25Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Many thanks for the patch.
