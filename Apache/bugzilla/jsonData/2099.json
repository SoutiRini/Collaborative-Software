That\u00b4s the whole point of using\nminor version numbers. This is explained in RFC 2145:\n\n\"   An HTTP server SHOULD send a response version equal to the highest\n   version for which the server is at least conditionally compliant, and\n   whose major version is less than or equal to the one received in the\n   request.  An HTTP server MUST NOT send a version for which it is not\n   at least conditionally compliant.  A server MAY send a 505 (HTTP\n   Version Not Supported) response if cannot send a response using the\n   major version used in the client's request.\""}]
