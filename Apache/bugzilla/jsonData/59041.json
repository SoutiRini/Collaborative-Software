[{"text": "JMeter distributed test is of great use when orchestrating tests across various test agents. Though it comes with costs of reduced throughput generated from test agents as they have to write results to master from time to time. The quicker the application responses the higher the throughput suffers. \n\nTo overcome this, I began to use DiskStorage mode so that test results are stored on slave machine and are transferred to master only after test run is over. But using DiskStorage deprives one of Summary Report which are printed on master console from time to time and provides a gist of ongoing test.\n\nIt would be of great help if Summary Report could be enable on DiskStorage mode. Which would get us best of both words that is - No compromise in  throughput and being able to see gist of test result during test run.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 59041, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 188669, "time": "2016-02-22T08:49:44Z", "creator": "tkumarb@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-02-22T08:49:44Z", "attachment_id": null}]
