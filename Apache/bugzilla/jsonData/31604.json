The first is that BCEL's \"Deprecated\" class\nhas a name clash with the new \"Deprecated\" interface in java.lang, which first\nappeared in jdk1.5. Two obvious solutions to this are to (1) rename BCEL's\nclass to something like \"DeprecatedAttr\" (which would break source that used\nthis class) or (2) change all internal references to \"Deprecated\" to the\nfully qualified class name \"org.apache.bcel.classfile.Deprecated\".\n\nThe second is much more minor. In \"build.xml\" the \"jar\" target depends on\nthe \"examples\" target. Shouldn't it depend on \"compile\" (or perhaps \"test\").\nIn the \"jar\" target build instructions, there is also a mandatory dependency\non the file \"manifest.txt\" it seems like this should be optional.
