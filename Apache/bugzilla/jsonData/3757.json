That's a primitive yet \nviable way of sharing definitions between projects. Properties can be shared \nwith property files, and there is always the <ant> task to call a target in \nanother file. Note also that you can feed back results from an <ant> call into \na parent build by writing them to a properties file and loading it in the \nparent. At that point your build is probably starting to look pretty hairy \nthough, so I don't recommend that approach.\n\n\n", "bug_id": 3757, "attachment_id": null, "id": 5910, "time": "2001-09-21T23:22:20Z", "creator": "steve_l@iseran.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-21T23:22:20Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
