[{"text": "Hi,\n\nWe are trying to write a huge amount of Data to Apache: About 11037 bytes of \ninformation.. See the Message..\n\nString msg =\"NI__NISM001103721204|5 ...\n...\n...\n\"993|2121260994|2121260995|2121260996|2121260997|2121260998|2121260999||||60003|\n0||0|||\" ;\n\n\nIt seems that Apache is receiving all these information.. I have added debug \nstatement in apache source code and got to know about this.\n\nBut after some time the following piece of code is hit in mod_cgi.c.\n\n            rv = apr_file_write_full(script_out, data, len, NULL);\n\n            if (rv != APR_SUCCESS) {\n                /* silly script stopped reading, soak up remaining message */\n                child_stopped_reading = 1;\n            }\nand it says that child_stopped_reading....Rest of the Data apache ignores..\n\nAt the Cgi Receiving Side we tried using both perl and C++ Code for receving \ndata. For C++ we tried both read and fread both of them is giving as partial \ndata and after that it says it met with some eof character. If we use perl this \ngives the same result...\n\n\nI modified apache source code so that in readwrite.c in the function \napr_file_write\n\nafter every write() I put a sleep for 2 seconds.. Then everything started \nworking..\n\nAny input for this problem will be of much help.. We are not able to proceed \nbecause of this.. \n\nIf the data is below 8192 bytes, things seems to be working fine..\n\nThanks and Regards,\nAbraham", "tags": [], "bug_id": 29627, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 59376, "time": "2004-06-17T04:31:40Z", "creator": "abru_ind@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-17T04:31:40Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "This sounds like bug 20295, an HP-UX specific pipe handling bug.
