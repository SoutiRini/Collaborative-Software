For example, it specifies \"jakarta-oro-2.0.5\" when \"jakarta-oro-2.0.8\" is the current \nrelease.  In addition, all the paths were relative to /java which seems unusual.  I've changed it so that all \nare relative to ${lib.home.dir} which is by default set to the users home directory.  That should allow those \nwho expand the current versions of the dependencies to the home directory to be able to just copy \nbuild.properties.sample to build.properties and go."}]
