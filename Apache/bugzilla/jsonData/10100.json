The text renderer used a fixed \nmatrix for placing text. It attempts to fit the print positions from FOP layout \nto the fixed matrix. Depending on the offsets, scale difference, etc lines of \ntext may skip or overlay.\n\nIt may be possible to correct this with judicious choices of margins, font, \nline spacing, etc in the FOs and CPI and LPI settings in the text renderer... \nbut this will not be easy.\n\nIn most cases the text renderer will not produce output suitable for \nproduction. However, I have found that it does a better job of producing plain \ntext output than some commercial products I have tried, although it does lean \ntowards better appearance at expense of preservation of data (i.e. the text may \nlook more like the original - but text could be overwritten losing the original \ndata).", "id": 18359, "time": "2002-06-21T19:35:32Z", "bug_id": 10100, "creation_time": "2002-06-21T19:35:32Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 10100, "id": 156264, "time": "2012-04-01T07:07:39Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:07:39Z", "is_private": false}]
