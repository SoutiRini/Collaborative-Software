Stopping\nTomcat looses all these optimizations.\n\nAllowing Tomcat to be reloaded without stopping the JVM will make\nchanging its configuration easier in a production environment.\nThe reload will be faster than a stop/start because the JVM won't have\nto reload classes and you won't loose all the runtime optimizations done by\nHotSpot."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 11112, "time": "2002-02-25T16:39:17Z", "bug_id": 6652, "creation_time": "2002-02-25T16:39:17Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I think you can do that with the admin webapp (or if you can't right now, \nyou'll be able to very soon)."}]
