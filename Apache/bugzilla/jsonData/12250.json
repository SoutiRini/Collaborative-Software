[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 12250, "text": "Hi,\n   I use Tomcat 4.1.9Beta with Sun JDK 1.4.0_01. I thing there is a bug about \nsession handling without cookies. I create a context and set to cookies \nattribute to false. I dont want to use browser cookies. I absolutely want to \nuse url rewriting like ...;jsessionid=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n   So I write all of my servlets and jsps with response.encodeURL and \nencodeRedirectUrl methods. When I set context cookies value to false Tomcat \ndont encode urls on a browser which cookies are enabled. But on another browser \nwhich cookies are disabled it encode all urls correctly.\n   When I set cookies to true it works correctly on both browser. Tomcat 4.0.3 \nworks fine when I set cookies false.(It encode all urls without check browser)\n   Shortly if I set context cookies attribute false tomcat must encode all urls \nwithout checking browsers cookies enabled or not. And tomcat must dont send a \ncookie to browser.\n   Thanks,\n\nSorry for my poor English Language.", "id": 22148, "time": "2002-09-03T09:16:43Z", "creator": "deniz_tatar@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2002-09-03T09:16:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "grenoml@yahoo.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 22198, "time": "2002-09-03T17:26:28Z", "bug_id": 12250, "creation_time": "2002-09-03T17:26:28Z", "text": "Yes, I am having exact same problem also."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 12250, "text": "Problem also exists with 4.1.10 release stable version.
