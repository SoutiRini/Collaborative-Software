This\nissue was located because we have an external SSL accelerator (not maintaned by\nus :( ) which handles the SSL and forwards to non-secure internal hosts. For\nthe original reverse mappings it would always construct the URL from the server\nconfig, which is configured for 'http'. Since the http -> https rewrites do not\nhappen in the SSL accel. (dont ask!) we want to make sure we rewrite to https\nourselves. This, together with the fact there is no sane handling anyway this\nseems like a good idea."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@shoenix.nl", "text": "Created attachment 7054\nPatch 2.0.46 to add non-relative reverse mappings", "id": 39845, "time": "2003-07-02T11:44:01Z", "bug_id": 21272, "creation_time": "2003-07-02T11:44:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 7054}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 21272, "text": "enabling the PatchAvailable keyword\nupdated doc on submitting patches is at http://httpd.apache.org/dev/patches.html\n", "id": 47888, "time": "2003-11-21T22:22:59Z", "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-11-21T22:22:59Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 25444 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 73243, "time": "2005-04-04T13:05:31Z", "bug_id": 21272, "creation_time": "2005-04-04T13:05:31Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@rikrose.net", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 17641\nPatch - Updated for 2.0.55\n\nPatch applies cleanly against 2.0.55", "id": 85679, "time": "2006-02-10T13:37:43Z", "bug_id": 21272, "creation_time": "2006-02-10T13:37:43Z", "attachment_id": 17641}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "It seems to be now available in 2.4.\n\nSee r1152273.", "is_private": false, "id": 168659, "creator": "christophe.jaillet@wanadoo.fr", "time": "2013-07-18T17:37:39Z", "bug_id": 21272, "creation_time": "2013-07-18T17:37:39Z", "attachment_id": null}]
