[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47754, "text": "I have a configuration directive\n\n<Location />\n    AddHandler cgi-script cgi\n    Options +ExecCGI +MultiViews\n    MultiViewsMatch Handlers\n</Location>\n\nso that I can access cgi scripts without extensions, eg http://localhost/foo runs foo.cgi in the document root.  The first two directives take effect, as http://localhost/foo.cgi works as expected.  But when I access just /foo, I get the \"None could be negotiated\" error.  It seems that the MultiViewsMatch Handlers directive is not applied.  If I instead change Location to a Directory, it works:\n\n<Directory /home>\n    AddHandler cgi-script cgi\n    Options +ExecCGI +MultiViews\n    MultiViewsMatch Handlers\n</Directory>\n\nNow, http://localhost/foo works.  So it looks as though MultiViewsMatch has no effect in a Location section.\n\nAndrew", "id": 130012, "time": "2009-08-27T19:02:45Z", "creator": "andrew@pimlott.net", "creation_time": "2009-08-27T19:02:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Behavior is by design.  <Location > refers to a user request, and does\nnot apply to a filesystem.\n\nDon't abuse <Location > when you mean <Files > or <Directory >", "is_private": false, "id": 130014, "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "time": "2009-08-27T19:23:23Z", "bug_id": 47754, "creation_time": "2009-08-27T19:23:23Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "andrew@pimlott.net", "is_private": false, "id": 130015, "creation_time": "2009-08-27T21:15:26Z", "time": "2009-08-27T21:15:26Z", "bug_id": 47754, "text": "Thanks for the quick reply!
