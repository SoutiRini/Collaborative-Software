[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44030, "text": "I am using poi-3.0.1-FINAL-20070705.  To get around the inability to create\ntables, I tried pre-creating a table in PowerPoint and importing and editing the\ncells with HSLF, but ran into a problem. I tried looping through all the\nTextBoxes and writing into them, and it turned out that if I wrote into more\nthan 22 TextBoxes, I would get this message when I tried to open the PPT file:\n\n\"PowerPoint was unable to display some of the text, images, or objects on slides\nin the file, filename.ppt, because they have become corrupted. Effected slides\nhave been replaced by blank slides\u2026\"\n\nWhen the PPT opens, I just get a blank slide.  If I only write into 22 TextBoxes\nor less, it works fine.  No Exceptions are being thrown or anything, there is\nonly a problem when I open the PPT file. Also, it seems to be only possible to\nedit a TextBox if it has text in it already.  So I created my Table with a\nsingle zero (0) in each cell. Here is a code snippet of what I am doing:\n\n//aShapeGroup is a table created in PowerPoint with 52 cells, 13x4\norg.apache.poi.hslf.model.Shape[] shg = aShapeGroup.getShapes();\n\n//replace shg.length with 22 and 23 to test. 22 or less will work, 23\nor greater will not.\nfor(int i=0; i < shg.length; i++) {\n       if\n(shg[i].getClass().getName().equals(\"org.apache.poi.hslf.model.TextBox\")) {\n               //all this does it write the index into the TextBox\n               tb.setText(String.valueOf(i));\n       }\n}", "id": 111485, "time": "2007-12-06T01:19:03Z", "creator": "sluu123@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-12-06T01:19:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44030, "text": "Created attachment 21237\nPPT imported for editing\n\nImported like this:\n\nSlideShow ppt = new SlideShow(new HSLFSlideShow(\"tableTemplate.ppt\"));", "id": 111486, "time": "2007-12-06T01:21:55Z", "creator": "sluu123@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-12-06T01:21:55Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 21237}, {"text": "The release notes for 3.0.2-BETA2 which is being voted on now indicate that\nsupport for Tables has been added to HSLF.\n\nIt can be downloaded from: http://people.apache.org/~yegor/POI-3.0.2-BETA2/\n\nThis code should be pretty stable since Yegor developed a private version of\nthis for us and that is very stable.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 44030, "is_private": false, "count": 2, "id": 112657, "time": "2008-01-08T16:09:38Z", "creator": "dfisher@jmlafferty.com", "creation_time": "2008-01-08T16:09:38Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44030, "attachment_id": null, "text": "As per David's comment, please could you indicate if your problem is fixed with\n3.0.2 beta 2?", "id": 112684, "time": "2008-01-09T03:16:18Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2008-01-09T03:16:18Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44030, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 113149, "time": "2008-01-25T15:48:47Z", "creator": "sluu123@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-01-25T15:48:47Z", "text": "The problem has not been fixed with poi-bin-3.0.2-beta2-20080112.
