[{"count": 0, "text": "I have been trying to trace down a problem with an application I am building on top of Tomcat 4.1. The \nproblem I was encountering was that my HTTP response headers were being returned to the client \nusing UTF-8 encoding.\n\nMy understanding of RFC 2068 is that all request and response headers should be encoded as ISO\n-8859-1. The only mechanism for supporting other encodings is by use of RFC 2047.\n\nThe issue becomes more curious when I notice that tomcat uses ISO-8859-1 to encode response \nheaders if the request is routed through the internal HTTP 1.1 implementation. However, if the request \nuses the Coyote JK implementation, then the header strings are encoded as UTF-8. This is being done \nexplicitly in org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler line 281.\n\nIs there any explanation why the Jk code is writing out the headers in UTF-8?", "creator": "eric_jacobson@filemaker.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 57673, "time": "2004-05-19T21:13:36Z", "bug_id": 29105, "creation_time": "2004-05-19T21:13:36Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Fixed now in the CVS.", "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 57684, "time": "2004-05-20T07:18:56Z", "bug_id": 29105, "creation_time": "2004-05-20T07:18:56Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
