I have been using \najp13 as a connector because initially there were problems with isSecure() on \nthe coyote connector that have now been fixed.  I tried the coyote connector \nagain recently, and there seems to be a problem where addCookie blasts any \ncookie that has previously been set.   In my case, my code looked something \nlike:\n\n  doGet(...)\n  {\n     ...\n     if (session.isNew())\n        response.addCookie(myCookie);\n     ...\n  }\n\nThis caused the session tracking to go astray, and the JSESSIONID cookie not to \nbe sent to the client.  Without the addCookie(), session tracking worked \nagain.  \n\nThis bug is similar to http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=234, \nexcept it's worse (ajp13 seems to allow 2 cookies per response, while coyote \nallows only 1).
