This\npath is sent to each super constructor till it meets HttpMethodbase. \nHttpMethodBase is able to get access to the queryString, but the path now sent\nno longer has a ? to split upon.\n\nBecause of this, calls to GET and PUT accept a queryString (eg: session\nauthentication) but calls to the WebDav extensions (LOCK, UNLOCK) do not.\n\nCalling new LockMethod(...) manually does not exhibit this problem, because\nURIUtils.encodePath() is not called.\n\nIs this intentional behavior?  If so, why is it only enforced in WebdavResource?"}]
