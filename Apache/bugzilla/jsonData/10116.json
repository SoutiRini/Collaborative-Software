[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 10116, "text": "I am trying to do the following thing:\n\nI created a jsp page called index.jsp an put it into the root path of a webapp.\nThis page shall be a welcome page. Therefore I could specify index.jsp as a \nwelcome page within the web descriptor, which works fine. Now I would like to \nhide the .jsp suffix from the users. Therefore I created a servlet mapping that \nmaps the index.jsp page to the url pattern /index.html and specified index.html \nto be a welcome page.\nThis doesn't seem to work. If I manually type into my \nbrowser \"<webapp>/index.html\" then my jsp page is invoked, which is fine, but \nif I just type \"<webapp>\" then I get a directory listing.\nI believe that this behaviour is not correct.\n\nFor better understanding I will post an extract of the web descriptor as well:\n\n<servlet>\n\t<servlet-name>root-page</servlet-name>\n\t<jsp-file>/index.jsp</jsp-file>\n</servlet>\n\n<servlet-mapping>\n\t<servlet-name>root-page</servlet-name>\n\t<url-pattern>/index.html</url-pattern>\n</servlet-mapping>\n\n<welcome-file-list>\n\t<welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>\n</welcome-file-list>\n\n\nSince index.html is specified as the welcome page, if I access the root \ndirectory / then, to my intuition, catalina should make a redirect or a forward \nto /index.html. It should then realize that a jsp page called /index.jsp is \nmapped to this URL and invoke it.", "id": 18300, "time": "2002-06-21T13:28:58Z", "creator": "wtff@freenet.de", "creation_time": "2002-06-21T13:28:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I don't know how to implement this in a satisfactory way.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 9016 ***", "id": 18301, "time": "2002-06-21T13:37:50Z", "bug_id": 10116, "creation_time": "2002-06-21T13:37:50Z", "is_private": false}]
