[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 178, "text": "I am using Tomcat 3.1 on AIX 4.3.3 to run my JSPs.  If the first two lines of my JSP are:\r\n\r\n<%@ page import=\"some.package.*\" %>\r\n<jsp:useBean id=\"website\" class=\"WebsiteBean\"/>\r\n\r\nI get an error about Tomcat not being able to create the bean.  But if I full-qualify the bean name, as such:\r\n\r\n<jsp:useBean id=\"website\" class=\"some.package.WebsiteBean\"/>\r\n\r\nThen it works.  To me, this is not as robust as it could be.  Furthermore, users who want to port their JSPs from other app servers such as Allaire JRun to Tomcat will have the same problem I had, because the name of the bean does not need to be fully-qualified in JRun.\r\n", "id": 158, "time": "2000-10-11T13:32:27Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2000-10-11T13:32:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "marc.saegesser@apropos.com", "text": "JSP 1.1 Specificatoin section 2.13.1.1 defines the code attribute as \"The fully \nqualified nameof the class that deinfes the implementation of the object...\".", "id": 1056, "time": "2001-03-07T16:42:45Z", "bug_id": 178, "creation_time": "2001-03-07T16:42:45Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
