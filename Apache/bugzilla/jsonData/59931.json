The originating useragent port cannot be determined and should be set to zero so that it is not misleading.\n\nSomething else to consider is that mod_log_config currently prints out the useragent port when the %{remote}p is specified. If the useragent IP is overrided, this will cause the logs to print the zeroed port. Should we also update mod_log_config to handle this?\n\nA few thoughts on what we could do:\n1. Modify mod_log_config to print out the client port if the useragent port is zero.\n2. Add another option for %{}p (e.g. %{client}p) so that users can still get the port if needed.\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.", "id": 192829, "time": "2016-08-02T20:30:11Z", "bug_id": 59931, "creation_time": "2016-08-02T20:30:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 34095\nPotential patch", "attachment_id": 34095, "id": 192830, "creator": "hwibell@gmail.com", "time": "2016-08-02T20:31:41Z", "bug_id": 59931, "creation_time": "2016-08-02T20:31:41Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": 34096, "bug_id": 59931, "text": "Created attachment 34096\nPotential patch - 2\n\nMoved where the port is zeroed out.", "id": 192839, "time": "2016-08-02T23:17:33Z", "creator": "hwibell@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-08-02T23:17:33Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59931, "text": "Thanks for the report & patch, committed in r1776458.", "id": 195706, "time": "2016-12-29T18:27:45Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-12-29T18:27:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
