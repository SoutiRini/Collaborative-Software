If it\ncannot find it, it stops with an error.\n\nif you have files in the wrong place and classic javac works, then it is by luck\nand not design. As sun say in their javac docs\n\n\"You should arrange source files in a directory tree that reflects their package\ntree.\" Should is a bit of an understatement, must is more appropriate.\n\nI am sorry that you have ignored this foundational java recommendation in your\nproject, but am afraid that ant will penalise you through repeated\nrecompilations. Ant, like modern IDEs and javac itself, requires the correct\nlayout of files in order to work correctly. "}]
