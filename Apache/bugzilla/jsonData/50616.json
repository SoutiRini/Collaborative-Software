Method writeAllText returns incorrect-incomplete result. No exception is thrown to indicate the problem.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Use the MS Word document from attachment.\n2. Create the input stream of the document and then use this snippet:\n\n            WordDocument wd = new WordDocument(inputStream);\n            StringWriter docTextWriter = new StringWriter();\n            PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(docTextWriter);\n            wd.writeAllText(pw);\n            result = docTextWriter.toString();\n\n3. Expected result is string containing \"Process description document \u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4 new\"\n4. Actual result is \"Process description\"\n5. No sign of internal error indicated, no exception is thrown.\n\nI would expect at least exception thrown as an indicator that something went wrong.", "id": 143464, "time": "2011-01-19T06:26:27Z", "creator": "peter.drozda@ids-scheer.com", "creation_time": "2011-01-19T06:26:27Z", "attachment_id": 26514}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50616, "is_private": false, "id": 143466, "creation_time": "2011-01-19T06:43:10Z", "time": "2011-01-19T06:43:10Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "text": "HDF is no longer supported, and only remains for existing legacy users.
