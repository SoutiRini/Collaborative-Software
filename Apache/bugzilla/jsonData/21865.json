[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Problem:\nThe chmod function fails when trying to change the mode on a file not located \nin the working directory. This problem only occurs when the client is a windows \nbased OS and the server is a UNIX based OS.\n\nExample: \nAn FTP task is called to transfer all files in the bin directory and all files \nthat are withing subdirectories of the bin directory.  The chmod task succedes \non any files located in the bin directory, but fails on anything located in \nbin/subfolder.\n\nCause:\nThe task calls the issueSiteCommand method with the clients original file \nseperator. With an NT client, the command is executed as chmod mode \ndirectory\\filename becuase that is the way the filename is stored in the array \nof client's included files.\n\nSourceFile: org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.net.FTP\nline#: 644 and 914 (revision 1.37)\n\nSolution???: since the chmod function can only be called on a UNIX server, the \neasiest way might be to call the String.replace('\\\\','/') on the filename \nbefore the command is passed to the doSiteCommand(FTPClient, String) \nfunction. ..becuase the '\\' file seperator will never be used with the chmod \ncommand (that I'm aware of).
