Very confusing!!!\nSimilar problem should happen with other actions in the manager servlet.\n(This problem does not happen in NN, cause IE and NN treat pages without an \nExpires header differently: NN treats them as pre-expired, IE treats them as \nalways valid.\n\nA cure could be to add response.setHeader(\"Expires\",\"-1\") in any page generated \nby the servlet.
