The \nbatchtest however tries to run the classes as test cases which results in \nfailed status for that class, which does not look nice in the test report\n\nRegards\nBo Rasmussen"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 26165, "attachment_id": 16868, "is_private": false, "id": 82097, "time": "2005-11-03T15:23:02Z", "creator": "badorek_jeffrey_w@cat.com", "creation_time": "2005-11-03T15:23:02Z", "text": "Created attachment 16868\nType checking JUnitTask\n\nThis little extension extends the current JUnitTask and uses bcel to do the\ntype checking you are talking about. It checks that a class extends\njunit.framework.TestCase or has a static method called \"suite()\". In addition,\nit also checks that the class is public and not abstract.\n\nI've also added a couple of new properties to include/exclude types to check.\nFor instance, by default I have includedTypes=\"junit.framework.TestCase\" and\nexcludedTypes=\"net.sourceforge.jwebunit.WebTestCase\".
