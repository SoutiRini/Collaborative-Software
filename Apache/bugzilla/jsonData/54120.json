[{"count": 0, "text": "Created attachment 29572\nThe fop conf\n\nThe problem is that the font FOP is looking for a font called \"sans-serif\" and Batik has the font \"SansSerif\". This mismatch means that when FOP asks for \"sans-serif\", a \"null\" is returned, which then causes an NPE.\n\nWhile this doesn't fix the underlying issue; the disparity between \"sans-serif\" in FOP and \"SansSerif\" in Batik, either way, an NPE isn't acceptable behaviour.\n\nI've attached the relevant fop conf where you can see the triplet name \"sans-serif\" being assigned to Helvetica. I'll attach an FO when I reduce it down to its simplest form", "bug_id": 54120, "attachment_id": 29572, "id": 163293, "time": "2012-11-08T17:49:35Z", "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-08T17:49:35Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54120, "attachment_id": null, "id": 163302, "time": "2012-11-09T09:17:41Z", "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-09T09:17:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Committed revision 1407393."}]
