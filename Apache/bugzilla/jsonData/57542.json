The difference is whether they have a description attribute or not.\n\nant -projecthelp only returns the main targets, unless there are no main targets.\n\nAFAICT this distinction is not used other places than in ant -projecthelp, so I would think that people are generally not aware of this distinction and hence sometimes forget to add descriptions to their targets. I have personally used Ant for a long time without noticing that some of my tasks lack a description.\n\ncomplete-ant-cmd.pl currently only suggests main targets.
