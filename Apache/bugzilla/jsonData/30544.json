[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30544, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I have Slide webdav server 2.1 M1 installed on my Windows 2000 box. I run it as \na webapp under Tomcat 5.0. I am using Webdav client 2.1 M1 to test the role \nbased permission features. When I grant permissions using the \"grant\" command \nto a resource, and use the \"acl\" command to look the granted permissions, I \nfind that every added permission has a prefix of \"nc3\". Lets say you are \ngranting a write persmission using the following command:\ngrant write on /Slide/files/rootdir4 to /Slide/users/john\nPermission gets granted successfully. When you use following acl command:\nacl /Slide/files/rootdir4, you see the following:\nACL for /Slide/files/rootdir4:\n------------------------------------------------------------\ngranted to /Slide/users/john    (not protected)   (not inherited)\n   DAV:nc3write\ngranted to /Slide/users/user1    (not protected)   (inherited \nfrom '/Slide/files')\n   DAV:all\ngranted to /Slide/roles/user    (not protected)   (inherited \nfrom '/Slide/files')\n   DAV:write\ngranted to property    (not protected)   (inherited from '/Slide/files')\n   DAV:read-acl\ngranted to /Slide/roles/root    (not protected)   (inherited from '/Slide/')\n   DAV:all\ngranted to all    (not protected)   (inherited from '/Slide/')\n   DAV:read\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote the prefix \"nc3\" for the write persmission granted.\n\nAlso, on the Slide server console, you will see the following warning::\n09 Aug 2004 10:12:49 - org.apache.slide.security.SecurityImpl - WARNING - Unknow\nn action /actions/nc3write\n\nAfter assigning this permission, you will find that the permission is not valid \nanymore, I mean user john cannot write to the resource \"/Slide/files/rootdir5\".\n\nI am in a project where we are building a UI for granting permissions in Slide. \nWe are stuck at this point with this bug. If I point my Java module to Webdav \nclient 2.0 library, everything works fine. Or, If I use webdav client 2.0 \ncommand line tool, everything works fine. I thing the bug was generated in \n2.1M1. Unfortunately 2.1M1 has other bug fixes that I use, so cannot go back to \n2.0. \n\nthanks,\nKrishna", "id": 61722, "time": "2004-08-09T16:23:33Z", "creator": "kkankipa@baan.com", "creation_time": "2004-08-09T16:23:33Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ozeigermann@apache.org", "text": "This bug has been introduced by uncleaned debug code that has been deleted in\nthe meantime. 2.1 beta 1 will not have this bug any more.", "id": 61728, "time": "2004-08-09T19:22:17Z", "bug_id": 30544, "creation_time": "2004-08-09T19:22:17Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
