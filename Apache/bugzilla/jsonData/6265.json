[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I've tried for hours to make Tomcat serve dynamic content of my application \n(JSP, servlets...) and Apache serve static content (GIF, CSS...) but it's \nimpossible.\nIf I only use Tomcat (4.0.1 or 4.0.2-b2), my application runs fine (static and \ndynamic content)\nWhen I try to connect Apache (1.3.22 or 1.3.23), I can't get all my application \nrunnig ! I can get JSP or servlet but every static content can't be reach and \nApache doesn't respond anymore.\nI tried creating an alias in httpd.con to my static content directory : I can \nget some images but there are still problems.\nI've the same problem when I try the JSP examples. With the default server.xml \nand httpd.conf files, it runs well when I use Tomcat alone but when I use \nApache, it displays the jsp/index.html page without the images and Apache \ndoesn't respond (trying to get the images...)\nIs there something I must change in sever.xml (not only Engine name ?) in the \n<Service name=\"Tomcat-Apache\"> section ? Must I duplicate the Host and Context \nsections from the <Service name=\"Tomcat-Standalone\"> section ?\nCan applications be used from Tomcat-Standalone or Tomcat-Apache without \nchanging the configuration ?\nThank you for helping me.", "is_private": false, "id": 10383, "creator": "grillotd@yahoo.fr", "time": "2002-02-06T10:46:02Z", "bug_id": 6265, "creation_time": "2002-02-06T10:46:02Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6265, "attachment_id": null, "id": 10389, "time": "2002-02-06T14:31:22Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-02-06T14:31:22Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please only file bugs in Bugzilla.
