The console window \ndisapeared right away and tomcat didn't shutdown. I can still access to my \nlocal host and the tomcatw.exe is still running.\n\nI went to the control panel's service tool to stop this service. It appears to \nstopped without any problem although very very slowly. but I can still access \nto my local host and the tomcatw.exe is still running.\n\nI restarted and try to start tomcat by run the startup.bat. again the window \ndisappear right away and tomcat didn't start.\n\nI searched in google. nobody seems to have the same problem.
