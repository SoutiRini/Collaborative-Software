[{"count": 0, "text": "Created attachment 31842\nscreen shot attached\n\nHi Team,\nI was trying to do the record in our admin site but the problem is like when i set the proxy and start recording, and then I refresh the page what I can see is the next page is not getting loaded and the j-meter goes to infinite loop. This is I checked in explorer 9 and when i tried the same thing chrome or mozila it asks for user authentication. I gave my user id and password but again it asks for user authentication and in the j-meter site the result is same as it is. When we stop recording i can the chrome browser displays 401 unauthorized error message.\n\nI tried to resolve the issue in several ways but couldn't do it. Request you to please have a look on the same and reply me as soon as possible. Thanks in advance!!\n\nNote: screen shot have been attached.", "creator": "pintup.consultant@herbalife.com", "attachment_id": 31842, "id": 176612, "time": "2014-07-23T06:11:23Z", "bug_id": 56760, "creation_time": "2014-07-23T06:11:23Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56760, "attachment_id": null, "id": 176613, "time": "2014-07-23T06:18:30Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2014-07-23T06:18:30Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please ask first on mailing list.\nBugzilla is not a support forum."}]
