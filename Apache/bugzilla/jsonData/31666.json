[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31666, "text": "Hello!\n\nI got to know JMeter as a very powerfull tool for loadtesting. So I am using \nJMeter at one of my customers (Roland Rechtsschutz AG, Cologne, Germany) for \nloadtesting and performance monitoring. Roland needed one enhancement: all \nsampleresults had to be stored in a database.\n\nSo I've implemented some classes which do the job.\n\nRoland and BEA would like to provide these classes to the JMeter comunity so \nthat everyone can use that enhancement.\n\nSince I am very new to JMeter development it would be great if some more \nexperienced JMeter developers could take a look at my code and integrate it \ninto official JMeter releases.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me... I'll help developing that code.\n\nBest Regards\n  Thomas\n\nThomas Ke\u00dfler\nSenior Business Concultant\nwww.bea.com", "id": 64981, "time": "2004-10-12T13:09:30Z", "creator": "tkessler@bea.com", "creation_time": "2004-10-12T13:09:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31666, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 13043\nzip containing classes", "id": 64983, "time": "2004-10-12T13:30:12Z", "creator": "tkessler@bea.com", "creation_time": "2004-10-12T13:30:12Z", "attachment_id": 13043}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "tkessler@bea.com", "attachment_id": 13044, "text": "Created attachment 13044\ncreate-script for db-table", "id": 64984, "time": "2004-10-12T13:32:20Z", "bug_id": 31666, "creation_time": "2004-10-12T13:32:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31666, "text": "thanks for the contribution, I will try to add it to CVS in 2 weeks.
