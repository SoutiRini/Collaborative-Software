I have a form which has one input field:\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"test/testServlet\">\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"name\">\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"save\">\n</form>\n\n2.

I have a fileter which sets the request characterEndoing to UTF-8, before \nany request parameter is read\n   request.setCharacterEncoding(\"UTF-8\");\n\n5. I then call request.getParameter(\"name\"), the value I got is Jos\u00c3\u00a9, instead \nof Jos\u00e9.\n\nSeems to me the request.getParameter() call is ignoring the characterEncoding I \nset earlier in the servlet filter.
