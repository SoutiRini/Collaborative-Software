[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "hey-\nthere should be some way of echoing something only if a property is set.  i know\nthat you can fake this by using an additional target with if in it and ant-call,\nbut i shouldn't have to make a new target to conditionally echo some text.  it\nis rather cumbersome to have to write a new target just so that you can\npotentially perform an echo or not.  it would make sense to add if and unless to\nthe list of attributes for echo.\n\na use case for this echo would be something like:\n\n<target name=\"foo\">\n  <!-- some stuff -->\n  <apply executable=\"someProg\" failonerror=\"false\"\nresultproperty=\"some.prog.failed\" failifexecutionfails=\"false\">\n    <!-- some arguments and other stuff -->\n  </apply>\n  <echo message=\"some-prog failed and certain files will not be generated.  but\nthe build will continue.\" if=\"{some.prog.failed}\" />\n</target>\n\nthis information should always be displayed if someProg failed (so the level\nattribute in echo does not come into play here).  however, it should only be\ndisplayed if someProg fails and not if the execution succeeded.\n\nin addition, there might be similar complaints about other tasks besides echo (i\nhaven't thought about this so i don't know if this is true or no).  so, as a\nmore general solution, why not add an if task which will execute if a property\nis set?  the semantics would be similar to that of fail except that it won't\nstop the build process.\n\nthanks for your work and consideration\n--matt goto", "is_private": false, "id": 100142, "creator": "hikuiishi@yahoo.com", "time": "2007-03-07T08:12:35Z", "bug_id": 41783, "creation_time": "2007-03-07T08:12:35Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "peterreilly@apache.org", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 2888 ***", "id": 100159, "time": "2007-03-07T10:46:24Z", "bug_id": 41783, "creation_time": "2007-03-07T10:46:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41783, "attachment_id": null, "id": 100160, "time": "2007-03-07T10:55:57Z", "creator": "peterreilly@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-03-07T10:55:57Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Opps, wrong number\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 28882 ***"}]
