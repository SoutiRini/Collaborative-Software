Not able to\n access any of the classes in this jar unless they are in the generic\nclasspath for the whole jvm. \nBy making the vbjorb.jar part of the JVM's classpath, everything works just \nfine.\nBut has been unsuccessful in making vbjorb.jar accessible via the web-inf/lib \ndirectory.\nof a particular WAR file.
