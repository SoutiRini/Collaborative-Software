[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58149, "text": "This is an extension of #58130. Currently, we support the CF12 family of records for HSSF, and the conditionalFormatting / cfRule tags for XSSF. In Office 2010, additional extensions to Conditional Formatting were added, such as picking icons from different icon sets, and more advanced databars.\n\nFor HSSF these seem to be encoded in CFEX, for XSSF it's with the ext / x14:conditionalFormattings / http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/spreadsheetml/2009/9/main tags\n\nThis will likely need more low level support (records + aggregates for HSSF, low-level xml within the exts for XSSF), then updates to the high level interfaces to expose the additional options\n\nThe NewStyleConditionalFormattings.xls{x} files contain these new style CFs, which should help with the testing of this, for when someone has the time to implement it all.", "id": 184069, "time": "2015-07-19T02:36:05Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2015-07-19T02:36:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
