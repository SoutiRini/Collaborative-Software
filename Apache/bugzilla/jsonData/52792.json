(see attached sample application)\nWhen a request comes for this servlet, Tomcat tries to inject this resource and to instantiate the servlet. If the resource is not found, 500 ISE is returned as a response code. In the error message returned in the error page, it is not specified the full composite name that Tomcat tries to lookup, but only the first part (the context) (see incorrect.png). Thus the end user cannot understand which is the resource that causes the problem, but only the context that cannot be found.\n\nI would like to propose a patch (attached). A screenshot (correct.png) with corrected error message is also attached.\n\nThanks in advance.\nRegards,\nVioleta Georgieva", "id": 154342, "time": "2012-02-28T20:30:12Z", "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-02-28T20:30:12Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "attachment_id": 28402, "is_private": false, "id": 154343, "time": "2012-02-28T20:32:03Z", "bug_id": 52792, "creation_time": "2012-02-28T20:32:03Z", "text": "Created attachment 28402\nIncorrect behaviour"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52792, "attachment_id": 28403, "text": "Created attachment 28403\nCorrect behaviour", "id": 154344, "time": "2012-02-28T20:32:34Z", "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-02-28T20:32:34Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52792, "attachment_id": 28404, "id": 154345, "time": "2012-02-28T20:35:36Z", "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-02-28T20:35:36Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 28404\nsample application"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in trunk and 7.0.x and will be included in 7.0.27 onwards.\n\nThere were multiple places where this could occur so i fixed them all.
