[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55257, "text": "Here is a small test application https://github.com/nickytd/websocket-echo-client I use to verify WS and WSS handling in websocket implementation. The case is simple: open #number(100 is default) of connections send 1000 short text messages close the session. The HTTP case is running just fine, however the SSL case is problematic. After 2 runs with 100 connections the SSL is unresponsive. The WS case is operational though. I'll look further into this and you're welcome to take a look and comment as well.\n\nCurrent Tomcat 8 revision under test is\nRepository Root: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf\nRevision: 1502433\n\ncheers\nniki", "id": 168554, "time": "2013-07-12T11:27:22Z", "creator": "nickytd@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-07-12T11:27:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Can't reproduce with latest from trunk", "attachment_id": null, "id": 168575, "creation_time": "2013-07-13T05:16:02Z", "time": "2013-07-13T05:16:02Z", "creator": "nickytd@gmail.com", "bug_id": 55257, "is_private": false}]
