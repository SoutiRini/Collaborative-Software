Today, it\ncannot be specified as a link to an external server. I see the point in the\ndocumentation, which states:\n\n\"In addition, if you use a remote URL in an ErrorDocument 401, the client will\nnot know to prompt the user for a password since it will not receive the 401\nstatus code. Therefore, if you use an ErrorDocument 401 directive then it must\nrefer to a local document.\"\n\nHowever, this is exactly what I would like to do.\n\nI have a page which should be reachable by username/password only, and only\nusing a scripted solution. Any other visitors should get redirected to a\ndifferent site. I don't want users that access the page without username to get\na password prompt, I want them to be redirected out of there.\n\nTherefore, I suggest removing the special treatment of 'ErrorDocument' for error\ncode 401. Perhaps replace it with a warning (although that would clutter up my\nlogs, I can live with it..)\n\n  // J", "id": 82465, "time": "2005-11-14T16:47:32Z", "creator": "apache.org@j.payandsurf.com", "creation_time": "2005-11-14T16:47:32Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "text": "So far as I understand the request you could do that with a local CGI script (or\nPHP script, or ...), I don't think it's worth changing the default behaviour.\n\n(but you cannot prevent a password dialog at all if you are ever sending a 401\nchallenge)", "bug_id": 37494, "is_private": false, "id": 82876, "time": "2005-11-26T13:48:21Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2005-11-26T13:48:21Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
