I tried the following rewrite rule:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} survey08app\nRewriteRule ^/survey08app/(.*)$ http://172.16.170.40/survey08app/$1 [P,L,QSA]\n\nIn the browser I typed http://hostname/survey08app/loginForm.htm. In the form that appeared I entered the login info. I then saw the apache forward it to http://172.16.170.40/survey08app/providerForm.htm. I expected to see http://hostname/survey08app/providerForm.htm\n\nI then started a thread in alt.apache.configuration with all the details\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/alt.apache.configuration/browse_thread/thread/d2d582f1d6391ead?hl=en#\n\nOne poster suggested mod_proxy. So I compiled the apache 2.2.4 with mod_proxy enabled and installed httpd. The following works:\n\n\n<VirtualHost *:81>\nProxyPass / http://172.16.170.40/\nProxyPassReverse / http://172.16.170.40/\nTransferLog \"logs/proxy.log\"\n</VirtualHost>\n\nBut this has the unintended side-effect of opening the port 81 on the firewall. So mod_proxy did not solve my original problem.\n\nI'd appreciate speedy resolution of this problem.\n\nThank you\nMurthy", "id": 115557, "time": "2008-04-11T12:56:23Z", "bug_id": 44811, "creation_time": "2008-04-11T12:56:23Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44811, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.", "id": 115564, "time": "2008-04-11T16:33:41Z", "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "creation_time": "2008-04-11T16:33:41Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
