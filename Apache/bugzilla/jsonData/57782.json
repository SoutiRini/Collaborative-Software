I made some changes in production server and then restarted tomcat server after clearing the cache. But after restarting tomcat the .java file is not getting created and it may be the reason that the changes are not getting reflected because of that. Kindly look into this with priority as the business is getting affected as no customized functionality can be restored back."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57782, "attachment_id": null, "id": 182190, "time": "2015-03-31T07:56:58Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-03-31T07:56:58Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
