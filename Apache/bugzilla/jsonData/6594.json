[{"text": "After re-deploying a webapp (contained in a WAR), it seems to still use the \nprevious version.  This is the procedure that I followed:\n\n1. http://localhost:8080/manager/remove?path=/mywebapp\n2. overwrite original mywebapp.war with an updated version (contains a trivial \ncomment change in the index.jsp - to test whether or not it's getting updated)\n3. http://localhost:8080/manager/install?\npath=/mywebapp&war=jar:file:/path/to/mywebapp.war!/\n\nWhen I load the webapp in a browser, it still shows the old index.jsp (e.g. the \ntrivial comment change isn't showing up).  I've tried a few different things \nlike deleting the work/localhost/mywebapp/* and webapps/mywebapp/* to clear the \ncached unpacked war and any session data.  But, I still get the same \"cached\" \nresults.\n\nThis only seems to occur when deploying WARs.  When I deploy the webapp as a \npath to an unpacked WAR, re-deploys work fine.\n\nPrior to upgrading to Tomcat 4.0.2, I was getting a similar problem as that \nreported in Bug #5364, but now that problems seems to be fixed.  Instead, I was \nthe above problem remaining.\n\nLastly, I'm running Tomcat 4.0.2 on RedHat Linux 6.2 with Apache 1.3.22 and \nmod_jk (AJP13).", "tags": [], "creator": "steve@silicongo.com", "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 10965, "time": "2002-02-20T20:31:45Z", "bug_id": 6594, "creation_time": "2002-02-20T20:31:45Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6594, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 10993, "time": "2002-02-21T05:44:41Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-02-21T05:44:41Z", "text": "It's unlikely this will be fixed soon."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Reopen.", "is_private": false, "id": 11187, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "time": "2002-02-27T02:57:05Z", "bug_id": 6594, "creation_time": "2002-02-27T02:57:05Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "The bug has been fixed on both branches.
