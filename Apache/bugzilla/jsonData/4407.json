After following the\ninstructions included with the binary distribution, I tried to start\nthe server like this:\n\n$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh\n\nDoing a \"ps\" immediately after running the above command shows a\nbunch of processes like this one:\n\nps -auxwww | fgrep jakarta\nroot      2645  0.0  7.0 178312 8868 pts/2   S    13:15   0:00 /usr/java/jdk1.3.\n1_01/bin/i386/native_threads/java -classpath /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-4.0.1/bin\n/bootstrap.jar:/usr/java/jdk1.3.1_01/lib/tools.jar -Dcatalina.base=/usr/local/ja\nkarta-tomcat-4.0.1 -Dcatalina.home=/usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-4.0.1 org.apache.ca\ntalina.startup.Bootstrap start\n\nHowever, all of these process die after a few seconds.
