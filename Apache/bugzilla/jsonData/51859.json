[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I'm using spring-mvc, and when it invokes requestDispatcher.forward(..), if a JasperException occurs (for example \"property active not found on type X\"), error-page handling is not taken into account.

If the buffer is not big enough, a partial page is shown, and no exception is logged.\n\nThe expected behaviour is to:\n- forward to the error page regardless of the buffer size\n- respect <error-page> entries in web.xml\n- still log the exception (not sure about that).", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 51859, "id": 149569, "time": "2011-09-21T06:35:05Z", "creator": "glamd@abv.bg", "creation_time": "2011-09-21T06:35:05Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Forwards are not permitted once the response is committed.\n\nError pages do work although there are lots of things you can do within your application that will prevent them from working - mainly committing the response.\n\nAll unhandled exceptions are logged.\n\n\nThis looks like a series of usage issues rather than bugs and the Tomcat users mailing list is the place to seek help.", "is_private": false, "id": 149589, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "time": "2011-09-21T13:11:51Z", "bug_id": 51859, "creation_time": "2011-09-21T13:11:51Z", "attachment_id": null}]
