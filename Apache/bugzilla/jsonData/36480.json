You will also need to check if Borland, your\nemployer, should also file a CCLA (Corporate CLA) with the ASF. I'm sorry about\nthe inconvenience. More information can be found under\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/. If you have any questions, please get back to me.\n- Would you please resubmit the patch against the latest SVN Trunk as soon as\nyou've submitted the ICLA and attach the boiler plate license header with the\ncopyright year \"2005\" to the new file?\n\nThanks very much for your contributions so far.
