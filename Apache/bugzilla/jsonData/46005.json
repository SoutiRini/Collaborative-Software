No doubt it would not be anywhere near fool proof, but the intention would be to prevent data from being transported in the open, so one would need to \"open the envelope\" in order to see the communication.\n\nMy thought is a protocol that the server and client would work out. The website would not have anything to do with this. Ether the browser or server would be able to decline the secure connection.\n\nI was also hoping it could be encrypted with \"open\" technology so it could be distributed with apache without restriction. No matter if the encryption can be \"broken\" relatively easily, its intent would not be to secure highly sensitive information, but rather to obscure the information on net so snoopers have a harder time collecting emails, or \"unsecured\" pass phrases. Or to remove from plain sight everything that is happening."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "It's not our business to invent protocols, so this doesn't belong on bugzilla.\n\nIt is our business to *implement* protocols.
