If I run the same .fo and .svg through fop 1.0dev I \nsee two sets of problems.  First, if there is a positive SVG translation being \napplied and stroke-opacity is 0 the marker position is off.  Second, if the \ntranslation is negative then both the line and marker positions are incorrect \nand if in addition stroke-opacity is 0 then the markers are not displayed at \nall.  I know it sounds a little weird.  The best thing is to run it and look at \nit.
