The advantage is that any variables\nexisting in the file are expanded. But there is drawback: content of the file is\nwritten also in scenario file.

This was an issue I just encountered as well. \n\nIf one doesn't actually need to post a file, then workaround is to paste the content into the value field of name/value pair section for HTTP sampler, can leave name field blank (for cases like making REST API call rather than form submission). But the unfortunate part is the UI for the name/value pair section sucks for long input strings, as it isn't resizable to be multi-line, so usable but not readable. That's where this bug/issue fix comes in nicely as you can put the data in text file that's easier to read and POST than via the form fields. Alternative fix in my case is make the form fields resizable and multiline supported.", "id": 150228, "time": "2011-10-05T21:57:14Z", "bug_id": 15468, "creation_time": "2011-10-05T21:57:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15468, "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 36694 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 150860, "time": "2011-10-23T20:26:54Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2011-10-23T20:26:54Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 15468, "text": "*** Bug 43850 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 153116, "time": "2012-01-24T18:12:19Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-24T18:12:19Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 15468, "text": "Has this been incorporated or any plans to incorporate this (substitution of variables in POST data provided as file)?", "id": 153139, "time": "2012-01-25T14:45:00Z", "creator": "crsjava@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-25T14:45:00Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "The patch has not been incorporated, as it has some disadvantages.\n\nAlso, the HTTP Sampler GUI has been enhanced to include a raw post body (will be in 2.6, due very soon).", "id": 153141, "time": "2012-01-25T15:12:27Z", "bug_id": 15468, "creation_time": "2012-01-25T15:12:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks a lot.
