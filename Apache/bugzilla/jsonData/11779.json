[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "using the Coyote AJP1.3 connector and mod_jk, when I perform BASIC\nauthentication using Apache 2.0.39, I get through Apache, but when I try to make\nthe call to request.getRemoteUser(), all it ever returns is null.\n\nWhen I use the, now deprecated, old AJP1.3 connector with\ntomcatAuthentication=\"false\", request.getRemoteUser() always gets the user that\nwas logged in through Apache, never null.\n\nFor this reason, I can't use the Coyote AJP connector.  Why is\ntomcatAuthentication=\"false\" not supported?  Is there a replacement for this\nfunctionality?  The biggest problem is, I can't use the Admin app without the\nCoyote AJP connector specified because the old connector doesn't support JMX. \nBTW, I try to get to the Admin app through port 8080 which doesn't get handled\nby Apache, but directly by Tomcat.  Why does one *have* to specify the Coyote\nAJP connector in order to allow JMX to work when the AJP connector isn't even a\nfactor in connecting to the Admin app through port 8080????\n\n\nJake", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 11779, "id": 21181, "time": "2002-08-16T21:11:23Z", "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "creation_time": "2002-08-16T21:11:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 11779, "text": "This will be fixed in 4.1.11.", "id": 22497, "time": "2002-09-09T10:46:47Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-09-09T10:46:47Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "is_private": false, "text": "This should probably have been marked as a duplicate of bug 12196 or the other \nway around.
