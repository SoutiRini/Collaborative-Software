When running as an applet, \nOptionConverter could use its own Properties object for the log4j properties \n(private to OptionConverter).  You can detect applet mode by checking whether \nfor System.getProperty( \"java.home\" ) craps out \n(http://java.sun.com/sfaq/index.html).\n\nThen, I could make a couple of calls into OptionConverter before initializing \nthe rest of log4j ... it would get the properties and I'd be golden ;)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 68295, "time": "2004-12-10T20:05:37Z", "bug_id": 19861, "creation_time": "2004-12-10T20:05:37Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I'd prefer not to incorporate such hacks into log4j."}]
