That is, it sometimes returns unqualified hostnames\n(instead of an ip, which is expected if it can't get a fully-qualified\nhostname). Other times it returns a hostname that has absolutely nothing to do\nwith the IP.\n\nSome examples I see in my logs:\n\n86.125.53.140 maps to msnbot.msn.com\n88.7.11.140 maps to msnbot.msn.com\n210.111.94.102 maps to crawl-66-249-66-138.googlebot.com\n218.190.175.145 maps to msnbot.msn.com\n\n   These are all logged by the servlet being hit, with it logging: \"ip \" +\nrequest.getRemoteAddr() + \" maps to \" + request.getRemoteHost()\n\nNow, if you try looking up the hostname associated with the above IPs after the\nfact you will notice none of them map to the hostnames that Tomcat claims it\ndoes. I suspect that sometimes when reverse lookup fails, Tomcat retains the\nrDNS result from the previous lookup instead of returning the string format of\nthe IP. This might also be a new bug introduced between 5.5.9 and 5.5.12 because\nI don't recall having this problem with 5.5.9.\n\n( I'm leaving the country today for a few weeks so please excuse me if I don't\nreply right away to any questions you might follow up with )", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 38100, "id": 84134, "time": "2006-01-02T17:38:00Z", "creator": "cowwoc@bbs.darktech.org", "creation_time": "2006-01-02T17:38:00Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "cowwoc@bbs.darktech.org", "is_private": false, "id": 84135, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 38100, "creation_time": "2006-01-02T18:28:51Z", "time": "2006-01-02T18:28:51Z", "text": "BTW: I only use the HTTP connector, not jk or apr.
