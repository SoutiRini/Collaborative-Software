[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "If you put a link inside a justified block, both the position and the width of \nthe link are not correctly calculated. The attached file provides some \nexamples.\n\nI'm posting this bug, besides reopening bug #953, because bug #953 only talks \nabout the position of the link, not about its width. I've reopened bug #953 \nanyway, because it refers to a test case (newlinktest.fo) that seems to be \nbroken (the justify cases).\n\nIn the attached file you may also notice (e.g. numbers 16 and 17) that \nsometimes the width of the link is slightly reduced (it is more clear in \nnumber 17 which is left aligned). It seems to be related to non-significant \nwhite space included in the end of the link text (??? I'm not to familiar with \nXSLFO spec, but in XSLT I believe it is non-significant).
