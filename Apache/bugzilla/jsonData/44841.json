The attached patch includes a Unix and Win32 implementation, along with a unit test named 'testfilelink'.\n\nSee the POSIX documentation for link(2) for more information about the system call. Windows implements this for NTFS filesystems using the CreateHardLink() function.\n\nThank you, and my ASF contributor agreement was sent to the Foundation via US Postal service yesterday.\n\nRegards,\n\n  - Mark Heily"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 21830\nnew function: apr_file_link() \n\nThe previous patch was missing a change to Makefile.in, so I simplified it and merged the unit test into the 'testfilecopy' test.

Nice addition to apr Mark!"}]
