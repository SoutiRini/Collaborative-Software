The doc definitely says that it is, but a lot of evidence points to otherwise; take revisions 102840 and 819480, for example. I did some manual testing and poking around the code, and it appears that the hard limit no longer applies (at least on 2.2.0 and upwards). The documentation should be updated to reflect that.\n\nIn addition to the attached patch, revision 819480 should be backported to 2.2.x.", "id": 178052, "time": "2014-09-23T14:41:17Z", "bug_id": 57009, "creation_time": "2014-09-23T14:41:17Z", "attachment_id": 32048}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 178408, "time": "2014-10-13T19:29:53Z", "bug_id": 57009, "creation_time": "2014-10-13T19:29:53Z", "text": "Thanks, applied doc patch back to 2.2 (r1631516, r1631517, r1631518).\n\nproposed r819480 for 2.2.x as well but closing PR on basis of doc update."}]
