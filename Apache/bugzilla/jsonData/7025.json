Either (1)we do not allow a <classpath> other \nthan \"srcdir\" or (2)the task should be smart enough as to get the class \ndefinition out of the jars in the classpath or (3)the task should just use the \nclasspath for verification but it should not complain if the class is not in \nthe srcdir.\n\nI think the correct behaviour should be (3).
