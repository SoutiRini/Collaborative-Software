[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The renderers rely on the FOUserAgent for configuration information, as such, I believe a cleaner interface would be to put the user-agent in the constructor of all the Renderers. This change would reduce the mutability of the renderers and go one step close to a cleaner interface.\n\nAll the examples set the user-agent within a few lines of instantiating the renderer. This gives more legitimacy for moving the user-agent to the constructor.\n\nAlthough this is part of the \"public\" API, it's not part of the documented API. It does have a public access modifier, but almost all the FOP classes do. I do appreciate the arguments for backwards compatibility are valid, however, FOP can't stay beholden to a dated API solely for reasons of backwards compatibility.
