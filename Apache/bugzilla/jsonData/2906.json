The \nfollowing distribution problem was observed:\n\nIf binary dist is downloaded, xalan jars are not included in it. When xalan is \ndownloaded separately - its only available version at the time (xalan-j_2_2_D6) \ndid not match the ant/optional.jar build and caused junitreport target \nexecution to crush. \n\nIf source distribution is downloaded, it would work once rebuild, except \nbuild.sh needed to be modified by hand to append xalanj1compat.jar to \nLOCALCLASSPATH. Also, more xalan jars are in fact required to run junitreport \nalthough Ant Manual documentation seem to imply that only compatibility jar is \nneeded...\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1) binary distributions of optional tasks should include complete set of \nmatching jars needed to execute such tasks\n\n2) source distributions should fix documentaion/build.sh and point to proper \nversion of supporting product distributions", "id": 4158, "time": "2001-07-30T14:52:40Z", "creator": "asokol@edocs.com", "creation_time": "2001-07-30T14:52:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sbailliez@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Documentation and code is fixed in Ant 1.4.x\n\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/OptionalTasks/junitreport.html\n\nThe task will run with either Xalan 2.x or Xalan 1.2.2. \n\nNote:For a framed format Xalan 1.2.2 will need Xerces(xerces.jar) as well as BSF\n(bsf.jar) that can be found in the distribution archive.
