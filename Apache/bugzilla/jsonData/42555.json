[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42555, "text": "Hi !\n\nI've taken some minutes to collect the different\ntranslation/internationalization errors for the french language in the GUI.\n\nHere is a list of those I've found and some times, there is even a proposed\ncorrection:\n - On the HTTP proxy server component's page, the \"grouper\" listbox contains and\nentry with the word \"sp\u00e9rateurs\" instead of \"s\u00e9parateurs\"\n - On the same page, the \"Set Keep-Alive\" checkbox is untranslated. It can be\n\"Connexion persistante\" and even in english, for non techies, it may become\n\"Persistent connection\"\n - The HTTP Request Defaults page's title is \"Requ\u00eate HTTP Request par d\u00e9faut\"\n(which is wrong) and should be \"Param\u00e8tres de requ\u00eate HTTP par d\u00e9faut\" or at\nleast \"Param\u00e8tres HTTP par d\u00e9faut\"\n - On the same page, the checkbox in the bottom called \"R\u00e9cup\u00e9rer toutes les\nresources incluses dans les fichiers HTML\", the word \"resources\" has not been\ntranslated and should be \"ressources\" (notice the number of 's')\n - All the listeners's pages contain the \"Erreurs log seulement\" checkbox which\nshould be \"Journaliser les erreurs uniquement\" or, shorter, \"Journaliser erreurs\nuniquement\"\n - On the ThreadGroup page, called \"Groupe de Thread\" should be translated into\n\"Groupe de fils d'ex\u00e9cution\" or, please, at least, add an 's' to Thread ! ;-)\n - The word Thread is used in the french translation in a lot of places but\nshould be translated as \"fil d'ex\u00e9cution\" in singular or \"fils d'ex\u00e9cution\" in\nplural form.\n - On the TestPlan page, the area for classpath management contains\n   - an untranslated label \"Add directory or jar to classpath\" which should\nbecome \"Ajouter un r\u00e9pertoire ou un fichier 'jar' au 'classpath'\". The quotes\nshould remain as thoses word shouldn't be translated.\n   - the \"library\" listbox should be called \"Biblioth\u00e8ques\"\n - On the page \"Voir l'arbre des R\u00e9sultats\" (\"View results tree\" in english) in\nthe \"response data\" tab, the following errors are present:\n   - the tab's title should be \"Donn\u00e9es r\u00e9ponse\" instead of \"Donn\u00e9e r\u00e9ponse\"\n   - the radio button in the bottom should be translated which would become:\n     - \"Show text\" -> \"Afficher comme texte brut\"\n     - \"Render HTML\" -> \"Afficher comme page web\"\n     - \"Render XML\" -> \"Afficher comme XML\"\n     - \"Download embedded resources\" -> \"T\u00e9l\u00e9charger toutes les ressources\nincluses\" (but this one is a checkbox not a radio button)\n - In the \"Options\" menu\n     - \"Language\" submenu:\n        - the title is translated as \"Langage\" which is a subtile mistake and\nshould be \"Langue\" instead\n        - \"Chinese (simplified)\" -> \"Chinois (simplifi\u00e9)\"\n        - \"Chinese (traditional)\" -> \"Chinois (traditionel)\"\n        - \"Spanish\" -> \"Espagnol\"\n - In the \"Lancer\"/\"Run\" menu:\n     - Inconsistency between the noun and the verb forms : \"D\u00e9marrer\" and\n\"D\u00e9marrage Distant\", the verbal form should be used as recommended by standard\nHuman Computer Interface guidelines (KDE, Gnome, Apple, Microsoft).\n     - Entry \"D\u00e9marrage Distante\" is mispelled as it should be \"D\u00e9marrage\nDistant\" (note the missing 'e'), idem for \"D\u00e9marrage Distante de tous\"\n\n \nThe use of camel case (first letter in upper case) for french nouns is\nincorrect. It is a german syntactic rule, not a french one. The GUI is full of\nthis kind of error, so I don't report each occurence here. Remember: only the\nvery first letter may be in upper case.\n\nLots of thanks for improving the application !", "id": 103865, "time": "2007-05-31T02:57:37Z", "creator": "michel.nolard@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-05-31T02:57:37Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "Thanks.\n\nCould you perhaps update the properties file (or provide a patch)?\n\nThe existing file is the file messages_fr.properties which can be found in:\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/jmeter/branches/rel-2-\n2/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/resources/", "id": 103905, "time": "2007-05-31T15:18:54Z", "bug_id": 42555, "creation_time": "2007-05-31T15:18:54Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42555, "text": "Ok, I'll try to look at this file.\n\nWhat's the tool to you use to generate those translation files ?
