[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "japher@hotmail.com", "text": "There is a bug in the java.beans.Introspector which means that it cannot find\nthe read method for a property of Boolean type (because it looks for the \"get\"\nprefix, not the \"is\" prefix). This is arguably the expected behaviour of the\nIntrospector, however since the java.beans.PropertyDescriptor acts differently\n(it can identify the property read method), this inconsistency hints it's a bug.\nAlso, with the advent of autoboxing, developers are supposed to be able to free\nthemselves from primitive types.\n\nThe commons EL library is affected by this bug, so using an interface like: -\n\npublic interface Bean {\n    Boolean isEnabled();\n}\n\nand an expression like: -\n${bean.enabled}\n\nfails with an ELException saying that the property could not be found (see\nattached log snippet).\n\nWebLogic does not suffer from this problem, presumably because they implement\ntheir own EL parser (don't use commons.el) which doesn't use the Introspector. I\nhave written a suggested workaround for this problem which would allow the\ncommons.el library to continue its use of the Introspector, but deal with this\nflaw (see attached). The AdditionalIntrospection could be used in the\nBeanInfoManager.initialise() method, like so: -\n\nPropertyDescriptor [] pds = mBeanInfo.getPropertyDescriptors ();\npds = AdditionalIntrospection.findMissingMethods(mBeanClass, pds); // new step", "id": 92324, "time": "2006-08-18T10:18:31Z", "bug_id": 40282, "creation_time": "2006-08-18T10:18:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "japher@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 92325, "time": "2006-08-18T10:21:05Z", "bug_id": 40282, "creation_time": "2006-08-18T10:21:05Z", "text": "Btw, I was intending to raise this on the commons product, el component (e.g.\nlike bug 37592), but I don't seem to have this option because Commons is missing\nfrom the Product field.
