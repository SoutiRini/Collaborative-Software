The name of the folder where I'm pointing  is \"[ Client ] Project\"\nBut when I try to access I have a \"Forbidden You don't have permission to access / on this server.\"\n\nThis is part of the httpd configuration, where I set those variables:\n\n<VirtualHost localhost>\n<Directory \"/Users/me/web/[ Client ] Project\">\nOptions FollowSymLinks Indexes\nAllowOverride All\nOrder deny,allow\nallow from All\n</Directory>\nServerName localhost\nServerAlias localhost tito 127.0.0.1\nScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ \"/Applications/AMPPS/www/cgi-bin/\"\nDocumentRoot \"/Users/me/web/[ Client ] Project\"\nErrorLog \"/Applications/AMPPS/apache/logs/error_log\"\nCustomLog \"/Applications/AMPPS/apache/logs/access.log\" combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\nI have tried so many combinations of naming the folder and my conclusion is that if there is \"open square brackets+something in the middle+close square brackets\"I always have the forbidden message.\nHere is all the combination of folder naming that I have tried and the results if it can help (logically, after each folder name change I have changed httpd.conf + restarted the server):\n\"[ Client ] Project\" => KO\n\"] Client [ Project\" => OK\n\"[ Client  Project\" => OK\n\" Client ] Project\" => OK\n\"[ Client [ Project\" => OK\n\"[C] Project\" => KO\n\"[ ] Project\" => KO\n\"[] Project\" => OK\n(The last two examples are the most strange one. If brackets are facing without nothing in the middle, no problem. But if something is put in the middle then KO )\n\nHopping that may help: What I'm thinking now is that there is maybe a conflict with IPv6, that uses brackets, but that is strange because, where I'm using brackets, it's not a place to use IPv6\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nPD: My OsX version wasn't in the list: 10.11", "id": 188913, "time": "2016-02-27T17:29:28Z", "creator": "jonathan.huet@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-02-27T17:29:28Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mike.rumph@oracle.com", "text": "Brackets are also used in globbing.\n\nA check for this is done in the apr_fnmatch_test function in APR in strings/apr_fnmatch.c.\n\nThe apr_fnmatch_test function is called several times within server/core.c and server/config.c.", "id": 189004, "time": "2016-03-01T16:54:13Z", "bug_id": 59086, "creation_time": "2016-03-01T16:54:13Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
