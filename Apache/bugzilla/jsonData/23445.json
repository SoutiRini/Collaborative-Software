[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23445, "text": "Created a small Java program that runs a generic SQL statement and places the \noutput of the statement into POI. When output file size from PIO is about \n1.6MB+ excel either crashes, hangs, or is unable to open the resulting file.\n\nWe have noticed that the JVM needs about 20 times the amount of RAM as the \noutput size will be, this seems very inefficient. But having the resultant XLS \nfile unreadable is worse.\n\nWith Office SR1 the file would typically crash or hang excel. With Office SR3 \nthe file would just not open, no error message either. We were able to get \nfailing XLS files to open with OpenOffice.\n\nDropped down to POI 1.5.1 and the same code is working ok even with very large \nexcel files. Tested to about 100k rows which was ~30mb xls file, but this took \nnearly 1 GB of RAM dedicated to the JVM and took about 45 minutes to run.", "id": 44754, "time": "2003-09-26T19:31:25Z", "creator": "pkitester@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-09-26T19:31:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 23445, "is_private": false, "id": 45124, "time": "2003-10-06T09:40:09Z", "creator": "avik@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-10-06T09:40:09Z", "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 15375 ***"}]
