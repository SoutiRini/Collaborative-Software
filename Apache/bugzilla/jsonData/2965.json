What you describe should work.\nHowever, in 3.1.x, URL pattern matching was case insensive on case insensitive\nfile systems such as that in Windows.  This could allow things to work\nin a case insensitive environment which wouldn't in a case sensitive environment\nsuch as Unix.  This was fixed in Tomcat 3.2.x.\n\nSince no active develompent is occuring in 3.1.x, I'm marking this bug as\nWONTFIX.  I highly recommend you upgrade to Tomcat 3.2.3, or perhaps Tomcat 3.3.\nBoth have fixes for a number of security vulnerabilities which are still\npresent in 3.1.1."}]
