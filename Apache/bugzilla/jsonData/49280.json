Also update the version number in the Trunk version of build.xml and commit it. This is the only change in the branch that won't have to be merged back in the Trunk.\n    * Update the index.xml for the new version.\n    * Make a test build and check everything's ok\n    * Tag the source tree with the release ID: svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/commons/branches/commons-1_4 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/commons/tags/commons-1_4\n    * Make a fresh checkout with the just created tag: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/commons/tags/commons-1_4\n    * Alternatively, create a build-local.properties file that points to the above libs.\n    * Run ant[.sh] dist. Do this with Sun JDK 1.4.2_08 or later. A Forrest installation is needed.\n    * Create signatures if they are not already added by the dist build. Don't forget to upload your KEY: gpg -a -b --force-v3-sigs xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.tar.gz etc.\n    * Add MD5 sums if they are not already added by the dist build: md5 xmlgraphics-commons-1.4-bin.tar.gz > xmlgraphics-commons-1.4-bin.tar.gz.md5\n    * Upload the release files to your \"public_html\" on people.apache.org and start a release vote on general@xmlgraphics.apache.org quoting the MD5 values for each file and their URLs.\n    * After the 72h release vote send a summary to general@xmlgraphics.apache.org and CC private@xmlgraphics.apache.org.", "id": 137093, "time": "2010-05-25T05:13:31Z", "creator": "spepping@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-05-25T05:13:31Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "spepping@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 137094, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 49280, "creation_time": "2010-05-25T05:17:16Z", "time": "2010-05-25T05:17:16Z", "text": "Step 4: Releasing\n\n4a.
