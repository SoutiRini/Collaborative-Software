[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48774, "attachment_id": null, "text": "One of the big problems that comet applications encounter is the 2 connection limit of the HTTP specification, which some browsers (eg, IE6 and IE7) adhere strictly to.  The most common approach to getting around this is DNS aliasing, where a wildcard DNS record causing all requests for all subdomains of a host to go to that host.  However, there is no way to configure what domain the JSESSIONID gets set on, which is always set to the incoming host name.  This completely breaks Tomcat session management when DNS aliasing is being used.\n\nIf tomcat is to support comet (which it does), this seems like a pretty major hole in its support of it, considering most comet implementations use DNS aliasing.", "id": 134683, "time": "2010-02-19T05:32:32Z", "creator": "jroper2@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-02-19T05:32:32Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 48379 ***", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 48774, "id": 136221, "time": "2010-04-17T03:27:29Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-04-17T03:27:29Z", "is_private": false}]
