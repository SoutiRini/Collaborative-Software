If you \nhave good suggestion. Please let me know.\n\nThanks & Best regards,\nDavid"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3452, "text": "You should use the built-in sql task for this.\nLook at the documentation at \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/CoreTasks/sql.html\n", "id": 5747, "time": "2001-09-18T22:11:42Z", "creator": "gautamg@grassroots-tech.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-18T22:11:42Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3452, "attachment_id": null, "id": 6102, "time": "2001-09-27T05:09:07Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2001-09-27T05:09:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "while I agree that <exec> should handle input as well, this clearly is an\nenhancement request, but not a blocker - so I've degraded it."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3452, "text": "input redirection implemented for Ant 1.6", "id": 30956, "time": "2003-02-09T12:20:18Z", "creator": "conor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-02-09T12:20:18Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
