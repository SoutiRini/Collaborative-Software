This addition to\nmod_expire addresses the latter case, allowing one to set different expire times\ndepending on whether the file being served is/isn't older than some set threshold.\n\nFor example, to set the expire time far into the future for JPG files that are\nmore than a week old:\n\n   ExpiresByType image/jpeg \"aged 1 week then 10 years\"\n\nThis leaves JPG images less than a week old without an expire tag, and ones a\nweek old or older with one 10 years in the distance (from the access time).\n\nIt also supports an \"else\" clause:\n\n  ExpireByType image/jpeg \"aged 1 week then 10 years else 1 hour\"\n\nThe patch does not include the documentation -- I wanted to gauge the reaction,\nfirst.\n\nThis small patch can go a long way toward allowing web sites to get the benefits\nof image caching, while still allowing a window for in-place updates.
