The\napplication allows for users to pass additional classpath entries on top of the\ncurrent system class path settings. When we use the ClassPath instance to create\na SyntheticRepository instance. We are unable to include a parent type\nClassPath. It is possible that some of the classes are referenced by the system\nclass path. While others are only contained within the passed classpath. To get\naround this issue. We would have to prepend or append the setting of the\njava.class.path properties. This can be troublesome since we do not know if the\nsystem classpath should be prepended or appended. The other issue is that this\ncan be used within a running application and users might enhance classes not\ncontained within the system class path before using them. These classes can not\nbe loaded by the system ClassLoader. If they are then the byte-code enhanced\nclass can not be used.\n\nI have a fix that extends the ClassPath class to include the concept of a parent\nClassPath. The parent instance is used exactly like the parent concept for a\nclass loader."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38426, "attachment_id": 17521, "is_private": false, "id": 85131, "time": "2006-01-27T20:41:44Z", "creator": "ccorsi@progress.com", "creation_time": "2006-01-27T20:41:44Z", "text": "Created attachment 17521\nPatch for ClassPath enhancement"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "tcurdt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Patch slightly adjusted.", "id": 133483, "time": "2010-01-10T12:06:49Z", "bug_id": 38426, "creation_time": "2010-01-10T12:06:49Z", "attachment_id": null}]
