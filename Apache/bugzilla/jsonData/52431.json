[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52431, "attachment_id": null, "text": "When we switched our project to maven, we started seeing a null pointer exception coming from the JPEGTranscoder, line 89.  The exception happens because the  singleton org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image.spi.ImageWriterRegistry instance does not have any ImageWriters registered so null is returned instead of a JPEGImageWriter instance.  \n\nLooking at the code for the ImageWriterRegistry class, I think there should be a file called \"org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image.spi.ImageWriter\" inside of META-INF/services/ in the distributed jar which lists the image writers to register during setup.  However, there is no such file in the batik-awt-util-1.7.jar.\n\nI do see a file in xmlgraphics-commons jar for the org.apache.xmlgraphics.image.writer.ImageWriter class, but the JPEGTranscoder doesn't use the registry from that package.", "id": 152597, "time": "2012-01-05T15:25:19Z", "creator": "jc75mail@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-01-05T15:25:19Z", "is_private": false}]
