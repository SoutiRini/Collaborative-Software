[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "david@windward.net", "text": "when xls files are created with POI and add-ins are enabled, it will crash \nExcel. It happens with most any add-in under 2000 & 2002 and happens with wasp \nunder 2003.\n\nAttached are two files.  One is the original created with POI, the other is \nthe repaired version (repaired with Excel 2003).  The file size is \nsignificantly different.  If I create a blank spreadsheet the file size is \n14k.  If I create a POI xls file, the size is 6k.  \n \nIf I repair the file, it ends up  being 14k.  I think there is something \nmissing from the file when it gets generated.\n\n??? - thanks - dave\n\nhttp://www.windwardreports.com/excel.zip", "id": 76190, "time": "2005-06-09T01:52:38Z", "bug_id": 35277, "creation_time": "2005-06-09T01:52:38Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35277, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This is quite an old bug-entry and the linked sample files cannot be opened any more, so there is not much hope that we can \"fix\" this currently. \n\nIf this is still a problem nowadays with fairly up-to-date versions of POI please reopen the bug-entry and attach the sample files together with some sample code that can be used to reproduce the problem.", "id": 181423, "time": "2015-03-01T21:41:42Z", "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "creation_time": "2015-03-01T21:41:42Z", "is_private": false}]
