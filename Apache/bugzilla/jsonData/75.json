Unfortunately, since the \nTagExtraInfo class derives from Object, and loads by means of its own class \nloader, it is in a different namespace, with no access to the pageContext.  \nThis means that TagExtraInfo class can't communicate easily with the servlet or \nthe JSP.  The result of this limitation is that taglibs can't be implemented \nthat rely on a runtime parameter or pageContext to generate scripting \nvariables.
