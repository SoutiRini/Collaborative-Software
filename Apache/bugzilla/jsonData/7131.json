Reading through the \nunicode charts, the character &#xAD; should appear properly using encoding ISO-\n8859-1.  I am using this encoding, but the character is \"unknown\" to FOP.  \nMeaning, I get the standard \"#\" when I use this &#xAD; character.  I really \nneed this character to appear properly as the soft hyphen because we have users \nin Hong Kong and Taiwan that are using our program and they cannot display the \ntraditional chinese properly without this character.  This greatly affects the \nbusiness of Yahoo!.  Please help me to find the reason for this character not \ndisplaying.\n\nThanks,\nAmy Weiss\n\nTechnical Yahoo!\nMedia Delivery Solutions\nYahoo!
