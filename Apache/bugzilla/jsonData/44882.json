I know that this is not a necessary feature for normal Reverse Proxies but for a balancer configuration i think it is highly desirable.I already posted a question to the user-list about this and explained what would be nice to have as a feature (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-users/200803.mbox/%3C47D1EA54.BE70.0010.0@brz.gv.at%3E). I have tried to implement this into the latest trunk version and for me it has worked, but i'm not a programmer (copied mostly only the timeout code) so maybe i did something really stupid. I only tried it with http protocol.\n\nHere is the test configuraton i used\n\n<VirtualHost xx.xx.xx.xx:8888>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com\n    DocumentRoot \"/home/xxx/htdocs\"\n    ServerName xx.xx.xx.xx\n    ProxyRequests Off\n    ProxySocketTimeout 60\n    <Proxy *>\n    Order deny,allow\n    Allow from all\n    </Proxy>\n    <Proxy balancer://mycluster>\n    BalancerMember http://xx.xxx.xx.xx1:9000 timeout=90 retry=420\n    BalancerMember http://xx.xxx.xx.xx2/cgi-bin/test-markus sockettimeout=15 timeout=90 retry=420\n    </Proxy>\n    ProxyPass /em !\n    ProxyPass /j2ee !\n    ProxyPass /server-status !\n    ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://xx.xxx.xx.xx1/\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://xx.xxx.xx.xx1:9000/\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://xx.xxx.xx.xx2/cgi-bin/test-markus\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://xx.xxx.xx.xx1:80/cgi-bin/test-markus\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\n    ProxyStatus On\n\n    ErrorLog \"logs/dummy-host.example.com-error_log\"\n    CustomLog \"logs/dummy-host.example.com-access_log\" common\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nThanks for your attention\nMichael"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "michael.haas@brz.gv.at", "text": "implemented with Bug 45445\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 45445 ***", "id": 131480, "time": "2009-10-28T14:17:57Z", "bug_id": 44882, "creation_time": "2009-10-28T14:17:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
