It doesn't read the CRLF after the \n\"0\" chunk that terminated the response. This is not a problem except \nwhen a keepalive connection is being used. That last CRLF is read as the \nfirst line of the next response which caused all kinds of problems for \nmod_proxy.\n\nOn the first request of a page through mod_proxy the page will return \nproperly, on the next (if a keepalive connection is in use) it will read the \nCRLF as the first line of the response and fail. The next load after that will \nreconnect and it will then work again. So responses using chunked \ntransfer encoding end up working through mod_proxy every other time."}, {"count": 1, "text": "Created attachment 1719\nPatch against 2.0.35's http_protocol.c to fix the problem", "bug_id": 8597, "attachment_id": 1719, "id": 14934, "time": "2002-04-28T02:22:18Z", "creator": "brian@brian-web.com", "creation_time": "2002-04-28T02:22:18Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8597, "attachment_id": null, "id": 14938, "time": "2002-04-28T06:51:33Z", "creator": "jerenkrantz@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-28T06:51:33Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please try out the latest snapshots of httpd-2.0 or wait for the forthcoming\nApache 2.0.36.
