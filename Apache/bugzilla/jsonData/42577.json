I must say that I'm not entirely\nhappy with the approach. font-stretch for me should ideally be part of the font\nselection process and not just squeeze the font. Some font-families offer\nspecially designed condensed or expanded font variants. At the moment, we're\njust using font-weight and font-style in the selection process but that's not\nenough. This also means we have to rethink the FontTriplet class as it wouldn't\nhave 3 elements anymore, but 4. Only if there's no condensed/expanded variant\navailable in the font selection should forced font stretching be used. Actually,\njust implementing like this would be fine by me, but putting the stretch value\nis the thing I really don't like here and what triggered my comment.\n\nWhen I've worked through most of my priorities in the next two or three months\nI'll try to find time to improve the whole font subsystem. It is something I\ncare about but at the moment I have to concentrate my time on different things."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42577, "attachment_id": null, "id": 110683, "time": "2007-11-18T10:28:50Z", "creator": "martin.voelkle@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-11-18T10:28:50Z", "is_private": false, "text": "You are probably right.
