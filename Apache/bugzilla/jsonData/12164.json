I will attach a very simple test-case. \n\nWhen you have a fo:block element which has the letter-spacing and text-align\nattributes set, the text inside this element is not displayed as expected in the\noutput PDF. The letter-spacing is applied as expected, but the alignment of the\ntext is incorrect. For example, if text-align=\"center\" and letter-spacing=\"5pt\"\nthe text is positioned off-center to the left.\n\nI am happy to supply any further information as required.\n\nThanks\nStuart"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 12164, "attachment_id": 2868, "id": 21975, "time": "2002-08-29T15:22:27Z", "creator": "sw@empolis.co.uk", "creation_time": "2002-08-29T15:22:27Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 2868\nTest Case"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 12164, "attachment_id": null, "id": 27002, "time": "2002-11-26T15:20:46Z", "creator": "oleg@tkachenko.com", "creation_time": "2002-11-26T15:20:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Cannot reproduce the problem, works fine in fop 0.20.4.
