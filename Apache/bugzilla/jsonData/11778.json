Apache, OTOH, gives any module a transparent window into\n  the ENTIRE server, the code, data structures etc.  This is what makes Apache\n  server modules so powerful and flexible.  It is also what forces us to break\n  module compatibility over the smallest details when they change.\n\n  Other web servers change no more or less than Apache from version to version,\n  and service pack to service pack.  They simply hide ALL those details from the\n  module, so that the external modules are unaffected by internal changes.\n\n  The Apache project works hard to keep these sorts of changes to a minimum, but\n  there is often no alternative.
