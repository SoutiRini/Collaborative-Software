I'm not an expert on DOM.\n\nI need to clone a Node (including all its childs) and assign a new name to this \ncopy. I found the method to clone the Node and to get the name, but there seems \nto be no way to change/set the name. The only way, I found, to create a new \nNode/Element and to assign a name to it, is by Document.createElement(). \nCould someone please guide me in the right direction in how to effectively \nclone a Node and all it's childs and to assign a new to the copy?\n\nthanks\nJuergen"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18654, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 34442, "time": "2003-04-03T14:27:05Z", "creator": "keshlam@us.ibm.com", "creation_time": "2003-04-03T14:27:05Z", "text": "In DOM Level 1 and  2, nodes may not be renamed.
