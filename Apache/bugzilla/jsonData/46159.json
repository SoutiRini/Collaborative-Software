But why? \n\n\nHSLF provides a way to export slides into images. You can capture slides into java.awt.Graphics2D object (or any other) and serialize it into a PNG or JPEG format. Please note, although HSLF attempts to render slides as close to PowerPoint as possible, the output may look differently from PowerPoint due to the following reasons:\n\n    * Java2D renders fonts differently vs PowerPoint. There are always some differences in the way the font glyphs are painted\n    * HSLF uses java.awt.font.LineBreakMeasurer to break text into lines. PowerPoint may do it in a different way.\n    * If a font from the presentation is not avaiable, then the JDK default font will be used.\n\nCurrent Limitations:\n\n    * Some types of shapes are not yet supported (WordArt, complex auto-shapes)\n    * Only Bitmap images (PNG, JPEG, DIB) can be rendered in Java\n\n        FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(\"slideshow.ppt\");\n        SlideShow ppt = new SlideShow(is);\n        is.close();\n        \n        Dimension pgsize = ppt.getPageSize();\n\n        Slide[] slide = ppt.getSlides();\n        for (int i = 0; i < slide.length; i++) {\n\n            BufferedImage img = new BufferedImage(pgsize.width, pgsize.height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);\n            Graphics2D graphics = img.createGraphics();\n            //clear the drawing area\n            graphics.setPaint(Color.white);\n            graphics.fill(new Rectangle2D.Float(0, 0, pgsize.width, pgsize.height));\n\n            //render\n            slide[i].draw(graphics);\n\n            //save the output\n            FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(\"slide-\"  + (i+1) + \".png\");\n            javax.imageio.ImageIO.write(img, \"png\", out);\n            out.close();\n        }", "is_private": false, "id": 122243, "creator": "jie.han@163.com", "time": "2008-11-06T06:00:28Z", "bug_id": 46159, "creation_time": "2008-11-06T06:00:28Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "text": "Please try the latest svn version. \nDaily builds are available at http://encore.torchbox.com/poi-svn-build/\n\nYegor", "id": 122533, "time": "2008-11-16T05:35:53Z", "bug_id": 46159, "creation_time": "2008-11-16T05:35:53Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "kiwiwings@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 179729, "creation_time": "2014-12-12T01:21:26Z", "time": "2014-12-12T01:21:26Z", "bug_id": 46159, "text": "Attachment missing and no user feedback for ages ... closing this for now.", "attachment_id": null}]
