When index.php is loaded manually, it is displayed like Atom/RSS Feed.  \n\nThis does not always happen but when we load the page for first time or when we force reload it several times (Ctrl + F5). \n\nTemporarily I've suggested the owner to block it using .htaccess Options -Indexes. I got a forbidden page few times so htaccess is doing its job! But still the problem is apache is not loading default index page and index.php is not parsed properly! \n\nI am just a staff at Vlexoforums.com!
