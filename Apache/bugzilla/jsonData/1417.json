If yes, then that \nshould be mentioned.\n\nRegards,\n-Arun", "count": 0, "id": 1939, "time": "2001-04-19T16:39:47Z", "creator": "arun.gupta@sun.com", "creation_time": "2001-04-19T16:39:47Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "craig.mcclanahan@sun.com", "text": "Hmm, the actual test for this in the catalina.sh script is:\n\n  if [ -z \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n    echo You must set JAVA_HOME ...\n    exit 1\n  fi\n\nwhich should only complain if $JAVA_HOME is either not set, or is set to a \nzero-length string.
