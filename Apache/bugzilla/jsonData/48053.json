In that case no new element would be necessary, we would just have to extend the scope of the existing fo:footnote element (that would possibly make the FO file incompatible with other FO processors, but IMO portable FO files will always remain a legend anyway).\n\nHowever, I'd rather investigate if you really need a footnote in an absolutely positioned block-container in the first place, or if that block really needs to be absolutely positioned. You may want to ask for advice on the fop-users mailing list.\n\n\nVincent", "id": 131405, "time": "2009-10-27T03:07:45Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2009-10-27T03:07:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48053, "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "id": 157576, "time": "2012-04-07T01:44:48Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:44:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48053, "is_private": false, "text": "increase priority for bugs with a patch", "id": 157853, "time": "2012-04-11T03:20:59Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-11T03:20:59Z", "attachment_id": null}]
