The message says:\n\n  Class org.apache.tools.ant.types.Commandline$Argument doesn't support \n  nested text elements\n\nThat makes you think you erroneously included an element of type \"text\".\n(Is it very similar to this message:\n\n  Class org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.ExecTask doesn't support the \n  nested \"bad\" element\n\nfor this kind of error:\n\n  <exec executable=\"xxx\" dir=\"somedir\" >\n    <bad>bad</bad>\n  </exec>\n\n.)\n\n\nThe message shouldn't say \"text elements,\" because the extraneous text \nis not an XML element.  I believe it should say \"character data content.\"\n\n\n(Also, the message would be clearer if it were in terms of what the user\ndeals with (parent XML elements in the build file) instead of internal\nclass names.  That is, something like:\n\n   exec.arg doesn't support the nested \"bad\" element\n\nor:\n\n   <exec...><arg...> doesn't support the nested \"bad\" element\n\nwould probably be better than:\n\n  Class org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.ExecTask doesn't support the \n  nested \"bad\" element\n\n)"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "glennm@apache.org", "text": "Basically fixed in 2001-07-04 nightly.
