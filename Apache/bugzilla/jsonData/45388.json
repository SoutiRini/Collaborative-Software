The patch consists of a \"pom.xml\" that should be added to trunk. Using this pom it's possible to build the java component of XML-Security with maven, run the unit tests and install an OSGi bundle into the local maven repository.\n\n1) mvn compile  - compiles the Java source code under src\n2) mvn test - runs the unit tests under src_unitTests (doesn't run the javax unit tests yet)\n3) mvn install - compile, run the tests and install the bundle into the local repository\n4) mvn -Pfastinstall - compile and install without running the tests\n\nI've tested the built artifact with both WSS4J and CXF. The pom will likely need some tweaking before 1.4.3 goes out, but it'll do for now.\n\nColm."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45388, "is_private": false, "count": 3, "id": 127514, "time": "2009-05-30T21:24:20Z", "creator": "fernando.ribeiro@upic.com.br", "creation_time": "2009-05-30T21:24:20Z", "text": "Looks good to me, make sure the POM is published to the appropriate Maven repositories."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45388, "attachment_id": null, "id": 128633, "time": "2009-07-08T03:06:11Z", "creator": "coheigea@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-07-08T03:06:11Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\nPatch applied.\n\nColm."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "fernando.ribeiro@upic.com.br", "attachment_id": null, "text": "When can I expect to find the file in the Maven repositories?", "id": 128672, "time": "2009-07-09T09:45:20Z", "bug_id": 45388, "creation_time": "2009-07-09T09:45:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "fernando.ribeiro@upic.com.br", "attachment_id": null, "text": "I still don't see it anywhere.", "id": 128975, "time": "2009-07-18T10:20:39Z", "bug_id": 45388, "creation_time": "2009-07-18T10:20:39Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "coheigea@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 128991, "time": "2009-07-20T02:59:13Z", "bug_id": 45388, "creation_time": "2009-07-20T02:59:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\nWe're about to release XML-Security 1.4.3.
