Should those be removed too, then? \n\nI do not ask for the option to be detailed on http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html, just for mod_log_config (and its options, of which BufferedLogs is but one) to be linked under that \"Other Log Files\" section. \n\nI do not think that this is unreasonable request, as the way it is (when even mod_log_forensic and mod_logio are mentioned but mod_log_config isn't) it looks like the option doesn't exist at all (I'd actually only found about it by looking at the source, and then re-searched the web and found other reference to it).\n\nAlso note that BufferedLogs is not so obscure -- it's very useful (I'd almost say necessary) on higher load servers; for example on our site (many prefork children, a lots of small and fast hits to serve, and yes we need the logs) the load average (caused mostly by millions of small write I/O on ext3) dropped from 10-20 to less than 1-2 just by turning that option on. I'd even recommend for that option to be On by default in apache\n\nSo I hope I've presented my case and would like to ask you to please reconsider, hence reopening the bug. All I'm asking is to add \"mod_log_config\" with \"BufferedLogs\", \"CookieLog\" and \"TransferLog\" to the \"Other Log Files\" \"Related Modules/Related Directives\" box for sake of completeness and helping others hoping to find that same (extremely useful) directive.\n\nI can make a patch for the webpage if that would help (although I would need XML source of the webpage to do that, as it looks auto-generated from XML)\n\nThank you for your time, and I hope you might find it reasonable thing to do.", "id": 140798, "time": "2010-10-18T09:40:02Z", "creator": "mnalis-apachebug@voyager.hr", "creation_time": "2010-10-18T09:40:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50110, "attachment_id": null, "id": 140799, "time": "2010-10-18T09:49:08Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-10-18T09:49:08Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Fair game for someone else who might be interested."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "rbowen@apache.org", "text": "I've added mod_log_config and BufferedLogs in the \"other logs\" section.
