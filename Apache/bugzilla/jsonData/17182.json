Cabarc prints an error message:  FCFileAdd() failed \nto open file.  Workaround:  Don't put spaces in any file names.  This \nworkaround is a problem becuase the OSD file in the cab often requires spaces \nin its name because its filename will be display to the user.\n\nFor my personal use, I corrected this problem by changing the method, File \ncreateListFile(Vector files), to put quotation marks around filenames.  The \nnew method body looks like this:\n{\n        File listFile = fileUtils.createTempFile(\"ant\", \"\", null);\n\n        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(listFile));\n\n        String curFilename;\n        \n        int filesSize = files.size();\n        for (int i = 0; i < filesSize; i++) {\n            curFilename = '\\\"' + files.elementAt(i).toString() + '\\\"';\n            writer.println(curFilename);\n        }\n        writer.close();\n\n        return listFile;\n}\n\nNote: I also corrected a performance issue cause by calling a (synchronized) \nmethod in a loop (Vector.size()).", "id": 31550, "time": "2003-02-18T21:15:21Z", "bug_id": 17182, "creation_time": "2003-02-18T21:15:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Patch (finally) applied.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 72347, "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "time": "2005-03-14T11:43:23Z", "bug_id": 17182, "creation_time": "2005-03-14T11:43:23Z", "is_private": false}]
