It hasn't happened\nagain but I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this kind of thing before.\n\nBasically we have a floor plan and we dynamically (via Java) fill in\nthe room areas with various colors, by setting the \"fill\" attribute\non the room's <polygon> to e.g. \"url(#roomColor.Green)\", where in the\n<defs> section we've defined the various colors, e.g.:\n\n  <linearGradient id=\"roomColor.Green\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#33ff33\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n\nWhat we saw the other day was these two anomalies on the screen:\n\n 1. A couple of rooms (call them X and Y) that were supposed to be grey\n    were 1/2 the right color (top half) but the bottom half was painted\n    with a \"snapshot\" of another room (call it Z). That is, in the bottom\n    half of X and Y you could see Z's room number along with it's green\n    coloring: a snapshot of Z rendered within the boundaries of X and Y.\n\n    It's as if the rendering engine forgot to reset it's buffer after\n    painting Z before painting X and Y, or something like that.\n\n  2. Next to, but outside of, room Z was a little rectangle of green\n     pixels that were completely out of place (nothing should have\n     been drawn there).\n\nThis happened on two different machines that happened to be displaying\nthe same map, so it doesn't seem to be a \"random glitch\".\n\nI am pretty certain that we are performing all updates within the\nupdate manager thread.\n\n-----------------------\n\nThis is with JDK 1.4.2 p5 on Debian Linux.", "count": 0, "id": 66496, "time": "2004-11-05T03:47:27Z", "bug_id": 32075, "creation_time": "2004-11-05T03:47:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 32075, "text": "Reassigning all open bugs to the development list.\nSorry for the mass mailing.", "id": 40383, "time": "2005-03-22T12:15:46Z", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-22T12:15:46Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 32075, "text": "Are you able to reproduce using the latest release [1], a development snapshot [2] (or even the trunk [3])?
