However, there are elements which have a fill attribute that should not be moved, namely animate/animateColor/animateMotion/animateTransform/set.  For these elements, SVGCSSStyler exhibits incorrect behavior.\n\nAttached is a patch which only moves the xml attributes into the style if it is found in the SVGStylingAttributes set and the element/attribute combination is not excluded.  The exclusions are kept in a private mapping.  This mapping can be added to in the future if other combinations of element/attribute should be excluded from being styled by the SVGCSSStyler.", "id": 138140, "time": "2010-07-04T19:38:53Z", "bug_id": 49549, "creation_time": "2010-07-04T19:38:53Z", "attachment_id": 25697}]
