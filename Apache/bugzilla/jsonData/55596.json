It would be equally practical to be able set the Expires header using mod_headers. While mod_expires can be used to set the Expires header, it's often not adequate for more elaborate use cases, such as conditional use based on the presence of environment variables. Using mod_headers to insert both of these headers is important to ensure consistent behavior.\n\nWe propose that support be added for the date format used by the Expires header (RFC 1123) for access time + seconds. Bug 40899 had a similar enhancement, but without the possibility of adding seconds. The \"u\" format specifier is used, and a seconds argument can be specified to add seconds to the time string value.\n\nHeader always set Expires {3600}u\n\nThis adds an Expires header with the correct time format for access time plus <seconds>, example:\n\nExpires: Wed, 25 Sep 2013 21:06:22 GMT\n\nThis way, we can add cache control headers in a consistent manner:\n\nHeader always set Cache-Control \"max-age=3600\"\nHeader always set Expires %{3600}u"}, {"attachment_id": 30883, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55596, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 170276, "time": "2013-09-25T21:55:04Z", "creator": "plantin@cobaltgroup.com", "creation_time": "2013-09-25T21:55:04Z", "text": "Created attachment 30883\nPatch against mod_headers 2.2.25"}, {"attachment_id": 30884, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55596, "text": "Created attachment 30884\nmod_headers.c module based on 2.2.25", "count": 2, "id": 170277, "time": "2013-09-25T21:56:03Z", "creator": "plantin@cobaltgroup.com", "creation_time": "2013-09-25T21:56:03Z", "is_private": false}]
