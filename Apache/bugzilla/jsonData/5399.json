Often, the last item entered doesn't register with JMeter (ie, \nyou type in the last value, and then go to your mouse and move on to the next \nthing).  To get your last table entry to register, hit the \"Enter\" key after \ntyping in your value.  I suspect that JMeter will send paramters that have \"\" \nas their value, but since the name of the parameter didn't register, jmeter is \nsending a blank for the whole thing.\n\nIn short, hit Enter after every value you type into that table.
