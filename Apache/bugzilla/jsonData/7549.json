[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7549, "text": "When running a build, the first thing we do is sync the latest codebase.  \nHowever, often some of the files on our machine are set to readable because \nthey contain some client-specific settings.  The p4sync task, however, will \nfail because without specifying force=\"true\", it will fail instead of \noverwriting a readable file.  This is the desired behavior, however there is no \nway to keep the build going after this because P4 tasks do not have the ability \nto not fail on error.\n\nSo I'd suggest modifying P4Base to add the following code\n\n    protected boolean failOnError = true;\n    /**\n     * Throw a BuildException if compilation fails\n     */\n    public void setFailonerror(boolean fail) {\n        failOnError = fail;\n    }\n\nAnd modify the catch block around line 180 (i.e. the Exception catch to be)\n\n\n            }catch(Exception e) {\n\t\tString failMsg = \"Problem exec'ing P4 command: \"+e.getMessage();\n\t\tif (failOnError) {\n\t\t   throw new BuildException(failMsg);\n\t\t}\n\t\telse {\n\t\t   log(failMsg, Project.MSG_ERR);\n\t\t}\n            }", "id": 12435, "time": "2002-03-28T00:04:10Z", "creator": "tamm@alum.mit.edu", "creation_time": "2002-03-28T00:04:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7549, "is_private": false, "text": "Done (P4Base.java rev 1.12) -- thanks!", "id": 12472, "time": "2002-03-28T22:41:40Z", "creator": "holtdl@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2002-03-28T22:41:40Z", "attachment_id": null}]
