Proxying would\nwork when going to http://domain.com/ but not http://domain.com/page, showing\nthe following message instead:\n\n-----\nProxy Error\nThe proxy server could not handle the request GET /page.\n\nReason: Host not found\n\nApache/1.3.31 Server at domain.com Port 80\n-----\n\nVirtual host is defined as follows:\n\n<VirtualHost 10.10.1.10>    \n  ServerName domain.com\n  ProxyPass / http://10.10.1.20\n</VirtualHost>\n\n10.10.1.20 would show an access.log entry for the / request, but nothing for /page. \n\n10.10.1.10 would not only show a 500 code in the access.log, no additional log\nentries.\n\nEventually, resolved the problem by using:\n\n  ProxyPass / http://10.10.1.20/\n\n(note the trailing forward slash). This may just be a configuration issue, but\nat the least there should be an error.log entry to help problem solving."}]
