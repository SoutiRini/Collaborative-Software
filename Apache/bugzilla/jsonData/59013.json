When loading a class a.b.c.MyClass, Rhino will try to load each package, i.e. a, then a.b, then a.b.c, then finally a.b.c.MyClass. So if you try to load a class that's in a org package, you get the exception.\n\nThe fix should be simple: if the class name starts with \"org\", do *not* assume that it's longer than 3 characters.", "id": 188476, "time": "2016-02-16T16:12:18Z", "creator": "max.tardiveau@ca.com", "creation_time": "2016-02-16T16:12:18Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 188477, "time": "2016-02-16T16:13:47Z", "bug_id": 59013, "creation_time": "2016-02-16T16:13:47Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 58999 ***"}]
