[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57299, "text": "Using mod_session_dbd is extremely inefficient, because session_dbd_load in mod_session_dbd.c fetches the session_record once per request from the database. Since there is also a \"Cache-Control no-cache\" header added, it's even worse than for normal pages where stylesheets, js, and so on are cached. For reference: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54608\n\nIf there are 16 \"items\" (images, stylesheets, ...) on a page, the database is queried at least 17 times (16 plus one for the page itself).\n\nThis is really annoying. So, in addition to storing it in the notes ( apr_table_setn(m->notes, note, (char *)zz);) I propose to store it in cache similar to mod_authn_dbd.c if it is available.", "id": 179461, "time": "2014-12-02T22:17:45Z", "creator": "christoph.rabel@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-12-02T22:17:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
