Other modules may include mod_request.h to access the optional functions, so it must not contain a module declaration.  The declaration should only be in mod_request.c\n\n3. mod_filter.c:149 requires a cast for ap_expr_string on platforms where AP_DECLARE specifies a non-default linkage (this cast is benign on Unix).\n\nThe attached trunk patch addresses these issues.", "is_private": false, "id": 116505, "creator": "Tom.Donovan@acm.org", "time": "2008-05-12T08:09:01Z", "bug_id": 44974, "creation_time": "2008-05-12T08:09:01Z", "attachment_id": 21949}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44974, "attachment_id": 21950, "text": "Created attachment 21950\nWindows project file for mod_request (trunk)\n\nFor Windows build, these changes are also needed:\n\n1. a mod_request.dsp project file is attached\n   it requires these manual steps:\n     mod_request.dsp should be added to the Apache.dsw workspace\n     buildbin should depend on mod_request\n     mod_request depends on libapr, libaprutil, libhttpd\n     add mod_request.h to \"headers\" in libhttpd with a custom-build step:\n       type .\\modules\\filters\\mod_request.h > .\\include\\mod_request.h\n   \n\n2. a Makefile.win patch is attached in the next comment.", "id": 116506, "time": "2008-05-12T08:10:55Z", "creator": "Tom.Donovan@acm.org", "creation_time": "2008-05-12T08:10:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 21951\nWindows Makefile.win patch (trunk)", "attachment_id": 21951, "id": 116507, "creator": "Tom.Donovan@acm.org", "time": "2008-05-12T08:11:37Z", "bug_id": 44974, "creation_time": "2008-05-12T08:11:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44974, "is_private": false, "text": "Tom, please also raise this on the dev list and feel free to commit your windows specific patches.", "id": 116521, "time": "2008-05-12T13:26:24Z", "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-05-12T13:26:24Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44974, "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to comment #3)\n> Tom, please also raise this on the dev list and feel free to commit your\n> windows specific patches.\n> \n\nThanks Ruediger, but I don't have commit access yet.
