It's possible for an AreaPtg's first row to be larger than its last row, or its first column to be larger than its last column. As a convenience, AreaPtg should provide a method that will re-sort the first/last row/columns to restore top left to lower right order.\n\nThis re-ordering currently happens as part of construction of the AreaPtg, but subsequent modifications (setFirstRow, setLastCol, etc) can allow the AreaPtg's references to become inverted.\n\nThis is needed when formulas are copied or compared.\n\nAttached patch includes unit test.", "id": 185402, "time": "2015-09-21T22:13:00Z", "creator": "onealj@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-09-21T22:13:00Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 33126}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58442, "text": "Applied code changes to trunk in r1711592.\n\nUpdated site docs in r1711595", "id": 186131, "time": "2015-10-31T11:18:08Z", "creator": "onealj@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-10-31T11:18:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
