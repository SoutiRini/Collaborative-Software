TC has been running real smooth as a standalone.  With iis5 and the plugin, static stuff is real fast.  Great job on new virutal host using host names or ips.  Have not run into any problems so far.\r\n\r\nHere is the only problem I have with the plug in:\r\nA response.sendRedirect(<url>) in the jsp code takes about 1 minute to get to iis5.  Here is the scenario:\r\n1. iis5log: GET /cart.jsp to isapi.dll - This jsp performs an update then does a response.sendRedirect() to itself with diff parameters.\r\n---- after 1 minute ----\r\n2. iis5log: GET /cart.jsp to isapi.dll - This part handled the sendRedirect.  Instant reponse.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the isapi detailed trace log and no errors.  There were no timestamps in the log so I don't know where it stalled out.  TC standalone processes these 2 gets in 1 second which is normal.\r\n\r\nThe cart.jsp code looks like this.\r\nBegin of cart.jsp\r\ndebug.print(in cart time)\r\nif param.action == buy then\r\n   update the cart\r\n   response.sendRedirect(\"cart.jsp?action=display\")\r\n   debug.print(redirect time)\r\n   return\r\nendif\r\n\r\n<html>....</html>\r\nEnd of cart.jsp\r\n\r\n\r\nI put debug statements to trace the action at jsp entry and within the buy logic.  It took about 1 minute after the response.sendRedirect command was exec and the next entry into this jsp.  This corresponds to the web server log.\r\nPlease check it out and email me if you need me to provide more info or whatever.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great job you folks are doing.\r\n\r\n"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 255, "is_private": false, "id": 1127, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "marc.saegesser@apropos.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-09T12:58:16Z", "time": "2001-03-09T12:58:16Z", "text": "Seems work work OK in TC3.2.1.
