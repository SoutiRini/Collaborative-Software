The function returns true (i.e. as if it succeeded) even\nwhen it actually fails to delete the folder because of insufficient permissions.\n\nTo reproduce:\nCreate a directory in the repository and set the permissions such that a\nspecific user can only read from that resource (or the parent resource).\nThen create a WebdavResource object for that user pointing to the directory you\njust created. Call the deleteMethod with the path to this directory.
