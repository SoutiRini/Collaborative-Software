I have been thinking about this problem. This \nis clearly a OS related problem. Which OS is this by the way?\n\nOpenning/closing a file with each append would be very slow. Moreover, it \nwouldn't solve the problem because while the viewer had the log file open \nlogging would fail. Not a good thing. \n\nI suggest you investigate how your OS handles opens files and whether there is \nnot a way to allow simultaneous opens of the same file.
