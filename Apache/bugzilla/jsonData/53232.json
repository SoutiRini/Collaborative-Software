Use JVisualVM (or something similar) to check instances of JSVGCanvas.\n\nRepeat the test by pressing the \"With Events\" button three times and closing each window.  Notice that JSVGCanvas doesn't dispose correctly after events were used.", "id": 159058, "time": "2012-05-15T07:07:43Z", "creator": "csebishop@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-05-15T07:07:43Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53232, "text": "After further testing it has been found that the problem was outside of Batik after all and even though the GC doesn't seem to want to clear up the canvases until the last minute, its not an actual memory leak.", "id": 160716, "time": "2012-07-18T13:52:26Z", "creator": "csebishop@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-07-18T13:52:26Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
