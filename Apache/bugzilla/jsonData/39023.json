These, while better than nothing, are not compatible with\nexisting RFA extensions and there is likely no way to remain compatible without\nmigrating the log4j 1.2 implementations forward.\n\nBased on the volume of traffic on RFA's on the mailing list, extending the RFA's\nappear to be a common practice.  Not supporting existing extensions in a 1.3\nrelease is unacceptible in my opinion.  However, the ported RFA's should be\nmarked as deprecated.  The ported RFA's could also be isolated in a\nlog4j-obsolete.jar with other files that have been superceded and should not be\nused in new code."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39023, "is_private": false, "id": 88650, "creation_time": "2006-04-29T03:53:08Z", "time": "2006-04-29T03:53:08Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "text": "*** Bug 38547 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 88651, "time": "2006-04-29T04:16:19Z", "bug_id": 39023, "creation_time": "2006-04-29T04:16:19Z", "text": "Added tests for v1_2-branch (rev 398081) and tests and restored implementations\nto trunk (rev 398080).  trunk implementations should be compatible now with\nlog4j 1.2, but will also have same implementation weaknesses which the previous\nshim avoided.
