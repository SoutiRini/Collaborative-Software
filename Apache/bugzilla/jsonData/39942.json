This would serve \nthree purposes: 1) it would act like an html style sheet and allow you to \ncentralize look and feel, 2) would allow for external customization of HSSF \nobjects without a recompile, and 3) would remove 5 to 10 lines of code per \nobject.  The configuration file could be divided into namespaces (ala log4j), \nallowing for the configuration to be hierarchical (meaning shared objects \nwould only have to be defined once).  For example:\n\n   IHSSFObjectFactory factory = HSSFObjectFactory.createFactory(\"namespace\");\n   HSSFFont headerFont = factory.createFont(\"header-font\");\n\nI have some sample code, but I'm not sure how I proceed from here."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39942, "text": "*** Bug 39943 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 97982, "time": "2007-01-12T03:00:26Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2007-01-12T03:00:26Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39942, "attachment_id": null, "text": "No update on this one for a very long time, thus I am closing this as LATER.
