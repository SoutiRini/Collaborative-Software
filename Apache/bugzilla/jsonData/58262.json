Unfortunately this now has an empty part for the SST which provides an empty stream, which the read-only shared strings table blows up trying to read.\n\nReadOnlySharedStringsTable already copes with the absence of an SST part, so I think it should behave similarly when the part has an empty stream."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58262, "attachment_id": null, "id": 184650, "time": "2015-08-19T11:10:28Z", "creator": "dtn-asfbugs@corefiling.co.uk", "creation_time": "2015-08-19T11:10:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Fixed in SVN r1696559"}]
