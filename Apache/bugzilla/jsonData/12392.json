Whenever I try to load a context \nusing the ISAPI redirector (so I don't have to use a port number) and the file \nin the context that I'm trying to load does not end in .jsp I receive a 404.  \nThis is a major blocker.  I really don't want to go through and rename a \nhundred files to .jsp and incur additionaly overhead just so this will work.  \nThe previous release that I was on was 4.0.3 and it had no problems like this.  \nPlease tell me this is a config setting somewhere.  I really don't want to back \nout this release if at all possible.", "id": 22434, "time": "2002-09-08T00:59:50Z", "creator": "grenoml@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2002-09-08T00:59:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "AFAIK, this works.
