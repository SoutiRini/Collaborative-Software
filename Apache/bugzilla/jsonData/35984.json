This makes it difficult for Wicket to safely intercept\n\"connection reset by peer\" messages since we cannot catch ClientAbortException\n(which is Tomcat-specific) and we are forced to parse Exception.getMessage() for\n\"connection reset by peer\". This is error-prone because we want to rely as\nlittle as possible on the contents of the message -- different JVMs throw\ndifferent messages sometimes.\n\nCan you please try fixing this for the next release?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35984, "attachment_id": null, "id": 80333, "time": "2005-09-22T19:24:46Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-09-22T19:24:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This has been fixed in 5.5.11."}]
