Sorry if this is fairly obvious, but I've been researching this\nheavily for quite some time and could not come up with anything.\n\nI'm interested in having Tomcat run as a service under an unpriveledged account\nin order to minimize security risks. I am able to change the \"Log on as\" user\nfor Tomcat with the Windows Services manager. If it is an Administrative account\nsuch as \"Local System,\" then I am able to access the server just fine. However,\nif it is an unpriveledged user, such as a user of group Users or the pre-defined\nLOCAL SERVICE and NETWORK SERVICE accounts, then I cannot access the server. The\nservice appears to start and run just fine, but when I point a browser to the\nserver it sits there spinning. It seems to me that this indicates that it is\nable to contact the server well enough, but that the server is prevented from\nrunning something because of its lesser priveledges. I checked the logs, but\nthey don't relate anything beyond startup and shutdown entries.\n\nIdeally, it would be nice to have it run as LOCAL SERVICE or NETWORK SERVICE\nbecause these are pre-defined accounts for this purpose.\n\nThanks a lot.", "id": 76737, "time": "2005-06-27T17:01:24Z", "bug_id": 35514, "creation_time": "2005-06-27T17:01:24Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35514, "is_private": false, "id": 76746, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-06-27T20:17:07Z", "time": "2005-06-27T20:17:07Z", "text": "Please use the tomcat-user list."}]
