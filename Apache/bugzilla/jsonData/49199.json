An intelligent caching mechanism would respect basedn and scope of a given LDAP search.  Essentially we need the caching to implement the behavior of an RFC-compliant \"mini-LDAP server.\"\n\nPlease enhance mod_ldap's cache implementation to the extent necessary to support \"scope-aware\" caching, specifically:\n\n1) the current implementation works for exact matches of both search expression and basedn, this is equivalent to \"basedn scoped\" searches.\n2) onelevel cache searches would include case 1 and also any cache entries with no more than one additional DN entry.\n3) subtree-scoped cache searches; would include both case 1, case 2, and any deeper matches.\n\nBased on Mr. Covener's comment on #49193, I've created this independent enhancement request directly against httpd, without noting dependency on #49193.", "id": 136457, "time": "2010-04-27T13:16:21Z", "creator": "peter.thomas@readi-systems.com", "creation_time": "2010-04-27T13:16:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
