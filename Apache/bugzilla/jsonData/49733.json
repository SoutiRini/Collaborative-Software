[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "This patch resolves all compilation, checkstyle, and javadocs warnings except as noted below. Comments follow:\n\n* incorporates the changes introduced by the patch previously posted with Bug 49700, so the comments which apply to it apply here as well; note that one deprecation warning remains due to an external dependency in xmlgraphics-commons;\n\n* patches 409 files in order to fix 1969 checkstyle errors, approximately 100 warnings when building javadocs, and a few dozen compilation warnings;\n\n* updates the checkstyle configuration to use version 5.1, and removes old support for versions 4.0 and 5.0;\n\n* introduces checkstyle-suppressions.xml in order to filter certain errors at the file level;\n\n* introduces checkstyle control comment keywords CSOFF, CSON, and CSOK in order to control generation of certain checkstyle errors within source files; CSOFF disables specific checks, CSON re-enables checks previously disabled, and CSOK disables checks for the same line on which the comment appears; search for these keywords in the patched source for examples of usage;\n\n* in general, an attempt was made to remove the underlying cause of a reported error or warning; however, in certain cases, doing so would have required a greater amount of refactoring or code rewriting than was desired at this time; authors or owners of specific code to which the above keywords have been applied may wish to revisit such code and make the necessary changes that permits removing the CS control keywords; in other cases, it may be desired to retain the keywords, e.g., if the author uses a different coding style than reflected by checkstyle-5.1.xml;\n\n* expands the fileset over which checkstyle runs to include both src/codegen and src/sandbox hierarchies;\n\n* modifies the checkstyle target to add \"package\" as a dependency in order to access compiled class files, access to which is needed to resolve Exception related class files from @throws comments in the code under test;\n\n* does not yet include sources in the test hierarchy for the purpose of performing checkstyle testing; this will accomplished after this patch is merged into the development trunk;\n\nThe following commands should be used to apply this patch to the FOP trunk:\n\n$ cd ${FOP_TRUNK}\n$ svn update -r 982124\n$ gzcat ~/fop-warnings-patch.diff.gz | patch -p0\n$ svn rm --force checkstyle-4.0.xml\n$ svn rm --force checkstyle-5.0.xml\n$ svn rm --force src/java/org/apache/fop/render/bitmap/PNGRenderer_onthefly.java\n$ svn add checkstyle-5.1.xml\n$ svn add checkstyle-suppressions.xml\n$ svn add src/java/org/apache/fop/render/bitmap/PNGRendererOnTheFly.java\n$ svn add src/java/org/apache/fop/svg/FOPTextHandlerAdapter.java\n\nThe following are provided as attachments to this bug report:\n\n* patch file (fop-warnings-patch.diff.gz)\n* transcript of patch application followed by \"ant clean junit checkstyle javadocs\"\n* before and after output from checkstyle\n\nThis patch was created relative to revision 982124 of FOP trunk.\n\nRegards,\nGlenn", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 49733, "id": 139014, "time": "2010-08-10T01:27:36Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-08-10T01:27:36Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49733, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 25870\nPatch against revision 982124.", "id": 139015, "time": "2010-08-10T01:29:41Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-08-10T01:29:41Z", "attachment_id": 25870}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49733, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 25871\nTranscript of patch application followed by build and test.", "id": 139016, "time": "2010-08-10T01:30:37Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-08-10T01:30:37Z", "attachment_id": 25871}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "Created attachment 25872\nCheckstyle report before patch.", "id": 139017, "time": "2010-08-10T01:31:41Z", "bug_id": 49733, "creation_time": "2010-08-10T01:31:41Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25872}, {"attachment_id": 25873, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49733, "text": "Created attachment 25873\nCheckstyle report after patch.", "count": 4, "id": 139018, "time": "2010-08-10T01:32:11Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-08-10T01:32:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49733, "is_private": false, "count": 5, "id": 139023, "time": "2010-08-10T06:34:29Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-08-10T06:34:29Z", "text": "Hi Glenn,\n\nThanks for your patch.
