I did find that the finalize() method of \nthe WriterAppender is suppose to call getFooter(), but this method was never \ncalled during my testing (since Garbage Collection on exit is at the jvm's \ndiscression, and forcing GC is not recommended).  I noticed that the \nSMTPAppender.sendBuffer() calls the getHeader(), formatContent(), and getFooter\n() all in sequence so that the Html would be well-formed, so maybe similar \nlogic needs to occur for the other appenders.  The appender I was trying to \nget this functionality was the DailyRollingFileAppender, which essentially \nmeans the WriterAppender.", "id": 41152, "time": "2003-07-22T12:19:00Z", "creator": "Jeremy.Nix@sfsltd.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-22T12:19:00Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21794, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 7948 ***", "id": 68397, "time": "2004-12-13T17:56:59Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2004-12-13T17:56:59Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
