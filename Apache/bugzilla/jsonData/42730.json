[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42730, "text": "Using Fedora 7 I was unable to connect to l4x.org using its IPv6 address from\nFirefox 2.0.0.4-2.  Disabling IPv6 support in Firefox let me connect, and I can\nconnect to myself running Apache 2.2.4 using IPv6.  I was able to connect to\nl4x.org's IPv6 IP address using curl.  By adding headers in curl I found that if\nthe length of the first GET command is greater than 166 bytes nothing is returned.\nThis command succeeds:\n\ncurl --header \"Accept:\" --header \"Accept-123456:e\" --header \"Accept-23:u\" l4x.org\n\nwhereas this one fails:\n\ncurl --header \"Accept:\" --header \"Accept-123456:e\" --header \"Accept-234:u\" l4x.org\n\nWireshark shows that the initial 3-way handshake works, but l4x.org responds to\nthe long GET command by repeating its [SYN,ACK], as though it had received\nnothing.  The client re-transmits with no effect.\n\nOther clients I tested are Konqueor, Epiphany, Kazehakase and Opera, all of\nwhich failed, and dillo, which succeeded, though dillo-i18n failed.\n\nI have only one computer, and no personal access to another that has IPv6\nconnectivity, so my testing is limited to finding web hosts with IPv6\nconnectivity and seeing if they work.  I do not know of any web hosts with IPv6\nconnectivity running Apache 2.2.4.  \n\nI was reluctant to report this problem because it seems so obvious that it\nshould have been fixed long ago.  I decided that I would rather risk wasting\nsomeone's time than risk having the bug go unreported.  If this is actually a\nproblem in my computer, router or ISP, please let me know.
