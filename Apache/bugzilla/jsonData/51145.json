A major part of the Servlet 3.0 specification is obviously the support for asynchronous requests.\n\nSome of us need to use Apache and mod_jk to provide load balancing over multiple Tomcats.  This means using the AJP connector, which currently has only BIO and APR options.  For those of us needing to support many (7) different platforms (some with horrific linkers, etc), APR is just not a workable solution -- too many nasty builds.\n\nFor such use cases a NIO-based AJP connector would really be enormously helpful.\n\nMark Thomas stated, \"I don't know how much work that would be to write but\nwith the refactoring already completed for Tomcat 7 it might be as\nlittle as 1000 lines of code.\"", "id": 146081, "time": "2011-05-03T11:27:32Z", "creator": "jessh@ptc.com", "creation_time": "2011-05-03T11:27:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51145, "text": "An initial implementation is available in trunk/7.0.x.
