To begin at the beginning:- \n  \n\"The chroot() system call changes a processes notion of where the root of the  \nfilesystem is.\"  \n \nI know what you mean, but that's gramatically nonsense. \n  \n\"This can be useful because it is possible to create directory heirarchy's  \nthat contain just the files a particular application needs to function.\"  \n  \nSame again.  The third sentence is the first not to grate painfully, though  \nI'd add a comma after \"In general\" before questioning exactly what you're  \ntrying to say (\"a common form of attack\" != \"in general\").  \n  \nMore seriously, I find the prose style challenging: the paragraphs are long  \nbut disjointed.  It's not helped by a layout that shoehorns it into a narrow  \ncolumn, with one third of the browser window on the left and another on the  \nright occupied by irrelevant junk.  \n  ", "id": 82604, "time": "2005-11-17T00:49:09Z", "bug_id": 37536, "creation_time": "2005-11-17T00:49:09Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37536, "text": "Reclassed to delete a version", "id": 135504, "time": "2010-03-22T06:00:34Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-03-22T06:00:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37536, "text": "Reclassed again to delete a version.", "id": 151576, "time": "2011-11-16T22:38:15Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-11-16T22:38:15Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
