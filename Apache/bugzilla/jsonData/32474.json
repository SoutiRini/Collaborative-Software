Apache will allow \nus to move these applications without changing URLS.\nie.\n - http://host/app1 -> Tomcat1: /app1\n - http://host/app2 -> Tomcat2: /app2\nThe complication is that we will now have 2 Tomcat Managers that we want to \naccess via the Apache frontend.\nThe idea was to use a mod_rewrite within a location tag to achieve:\n - http://host/manager1/html -> Tomcat1: /manager\n - http://host/manager2/html -> Tomcat2: /manager\n\nOur httpd.conf looks like:\n\n  <Location \"/app1\">\n    JkUriSet worker lb:lb_tomcat1\n  </Location>\n  <Location \"/app2\">\n    JkUriSet worker lb:lb_tomcat2\n  </Location>\n  <Location \"/manager1\">\n    RewriteEngine on\n    RewriteRule ^/manager1/(.*)$ /manager/$1\n    JkUriSet worker lb:lb_tomcat1\n  </Location>\n  <Location \"/manager2\">\n    RewriteEngine on\n    RewriteRule ^/manager2/(.*)$ /manager/$1\n    JkUriSet worker lb:lb_tomcat2\n  </Location>\n\nOn Apache 2.0.52 we get the following error:\n  Parent: child process exited with status 1073807364 -- Restarting.\nOn Apache 2.0.48 we got the error:\n  Parent: child process exited with status 3221225477 -- Restarting.\n\nThe app1 and app2 redirects work fine. If we move the RewriteEngine/RewriteRule \noutside of the Location tag then it correctly rewrites the URL (but goes to the \nfile system instead of the JK2 interface).\n\nOur workaround is simply to rename the managers on each tomcat instance (and \ndisable the mod_rewrite package).\n\nHowever, I thought I would provide this info in case it assists you in fixing \nthis bug."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 67865, "time": "2004-12-03T08:54:10Z", "bug_id": 32474, "creation_time": "2004-12-03T08:54:10Z", "text": "Alex, this is a totally different issue.
