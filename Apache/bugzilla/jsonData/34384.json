I've  \nhad to stop to design an entirely new approach to configure, make, install,  \nautomake, and libtool, based on Apache's use of files such as layout, rather  \nthan the ever growing scripts.  \n  \nat http://www.SourceForge.net/projects/meddac  \n  \nunder NewConfigure.  \n  \nThe 3 million byte configure for PHP has gotten too big and it's nearly  \nimpossible to figure out what went wrong when something goes wrong between it  \nand make or make install using current scripts.  \n  \nI included a DECLARATIONS.c file just so that should some variable not get  \nassigned, such as @exp_errordir@,  you get taken to the cause of the error.  If \nthe brackets are wrong there, it's easier than looking for the bad bracket, \nquote, demiquote, or tick, or missing ones, than searching the entire \nconfigure, make, or make install script. \n \nWork in progress. \n "}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "OlafvdSpek@GMail.Com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 81248, "time": "2005-10-17T15:47:53Z", "bug_id": 34384, "creation_time": "2005-10-17T15:47:53Z", "text": "I can confirm this bug on a Windows 2000 system using MSI.\n"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "GinEric@Musics.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 81258, "time": "2005-10-17T17:44:36Z", "bug_id": 34384, "creation_time": "2005-10-17T17:44:36Z", "text": "(In reply to comment #5) \n> I can confirm this bug on a Windows 2000 system using MSI. \n>  \n \nSince it was a simple matter to change the missed path in the httpd.conf file \nand it worked, I haven't seen much else of it. \n \nI think what's important is the suggestion that other developers follow \nApache's lead and start using the \"layout\" approach and perhaps everyone should \nconsider helping a little on developing something standard for inclusion of \nLAYOUT.c  DECLARATIONS.c  and  PATHS.c \n \nThen, it would just be a matter of using something like lxr to find a bad \ncompiled object after either a bad compile error report or a regular binary \nerror report during run time. \n \n "}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "OlafvdSpek@GMail.Com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 81261, "time": "2005-10-17T18:03:06Z", "bug_id": 34384, "creation_time": "2005-10-17T18:03:06Z", "text": "And on a Windows XP system using MSI.\n\n> Since it was a simple matter to change the missed path in the httpd.conf file \nand it worked, I haven't seen much else of it. \n\nIt should still be solved.\n\n> The internationalized error documents require mod_alias, mod_include and \nmod_negotiation.
