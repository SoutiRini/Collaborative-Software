This link is \nsupposed to call up all open Bugs against Tomcat 5, but it is broken and instead results in a Bugzilla \nerror message. \n\nThe Bugzilla error message says to mail the Bugzilla administrator, which is the infrastructure \nmailinglist in general and yours truly specifically. However, the brokenness is not in Bugzilla, but in the \nURL on the Tomcat home page. \n\nFixing this is a simple matter of removing the occurrences of %27 in the Bugzilla URL. However, in the \npatch that I'm about to attach I have significantly shortened the URL since you don't have to pass \nBugzilla the empty fields. \n\nHope we can fix this fastly: meanwhile I'll update the Bugzilla error page to point back to this bug.", "id": 69731, "time": "2005-01-15T18:20:23Z", "creator": "sander@temme.net", "creation_time": "2005-01-15T18:20:23Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sander@temme.net", "attachment_id": 14013, "id": 69732, "time": "2005-01-15T18:21:02Z", "bug_id": 33117, "creation_time": "2005-01-15T18:21:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 14013\nFix Bugzilla deep link URL on Tomcat default home page."}, {"count": 2, "text": "Fixed in CVS.
