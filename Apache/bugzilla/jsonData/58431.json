Changing the naming in the default servlet.xml is a bad idea.\n\nI am sure that the default naming is mentioned in many places, that will be broken / obsoleted by this change: books, documentations, FAQs, discussions, etc.\n\n2. Access Log and java.util.logging logs are different beasts, serving different purpose and having different format. It is good to keep them separate.\n\nI do not know whether this naming was a conscious decision 10+ years ago, or it just happened this way, but I find this feature useful.\n\n\n3. Apache HTTPD [1] uses \"logs/access_log\" in its examples. I think that if that log is rotated it will grow a date suffix.\n\n[1] http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog\n\n\nI do not see enough reasons for making the proposed change."}]
