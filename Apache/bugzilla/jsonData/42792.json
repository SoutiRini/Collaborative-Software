The last page loaded is still held\nopen by the Tomcat java vm and hence the admin interface is unable to delete the\nold webapp directory and deploy the new war file.\n\nOnly solution at this point is to stop Tomcat, manually delete the old webapp\ndirectory and then redeploy the new version of the webapp war file.\n\nI also tried stopping the app before deploying the new version with similar results.\n\n\n/sanjay", "id": 104987, "time": "2007-07-02T04:40:39Z", "creator": "sanjay.madhavan@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-02T04:40:39Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This is a well known 'feature' of windows.
