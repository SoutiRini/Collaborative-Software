As of JDK 1.7, SimpleDateFormat added code X to handle both.\n\nAttached is a J-Unit test re-affirming the above along with a fix we're going to be looking at applying locally until this is fixed.", "id": 192050, "time": "2016-07-01T16:56:33Z", "creator": "eliut.hernandez@morningstar.com", "creation_time": "2016-07-01T16:56:33Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 34000}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "text": "We still support Java 6, so we can't sadly use the nice X type\n\nWe already have some timezone support, in r1751379 I've expanded it slightly and added some read and write unit tests\n\nCould you please grab a svn build / nightly build / wait for 3.15 beta 3, and let us know if that solves it?
