When this change was \nnot in the script, I was getting a warning like c:\\c\\jdk1.3.1_01\\bin is not \nvalid. My JIKESPATH is set to /c/jdk1.3.1_01/bin so the message was because of \na bad jikes.class.path property.\n\nIn my script, I also added a -Dbuild.compiler=jikes, but I think that many \nfolks would not want that to be turned on.", "id": 11529, "time": "2002-03-07T01:10:35Z", "creator": "richard.hensley@mckesson.com", "creation_time": "2002-03-07T01:10:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6943, "attachment_id": null, "id": 12973, "creation_time": "2002-04-08T00:45:44Z", "time": "2002-04-08T00:45:44Z", "creator": "holtdl@yahoo.com", "text": "Fixed (rev 1.17)", "is_private": false}]
