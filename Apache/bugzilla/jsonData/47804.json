However, all of the data columns\nin the resulting worksheet were hidden, not just the ones for future periods.\n\nNoticing that the hidden columns all had the same width and speculating that\nthe bug might be related to data sharing, I tried tweaking the columns to all\nhave slightly different widths. That fixed the problem.\n\nAffects both Excel Mac 2008 and Excel 2007 on Windows."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47804, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 130872, "time": "2009-10-04T03:10:52Z", "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "creation_time": "2009-10-04T03:10:52Z", "text": "setColumnHidden didn't work for columns included a column span. \n\nThe fix was committed in r821497\n\nYegor"}]
