[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi all !\n\nI've developed a servlet (\"BinaryStreaming\" based on \"StreamingContent\" by Raj Behera) which does a \nbinary stream of a mpeg video file which is created progressively (by another servlet/software/Unix \ncommand/... not important ) and finally read and played by Quicktime.\nI use Apache and Tomcat so I've installed mod_jk\n\nAll work well (-> MacOS and Windows) but... :\nIf I go on     http://localhost:8080/my_test/BinaryStreaming     it works well with QuickTime 7 and \nQuickTime 6 (6, 6.5, 6.5.2, ...). \n\nI have mod_jk so I can go on      http://localhost/my_test/BinaryStreaming       and here it still works \nwell with QT7.\nBut QT6 seems to wait that the video file is entirely created to start the viewing instead of starting to \nplay the movie as soon as there is data in it, progressively.\n-> like it does with QT7 and QT6 with :8080  OR  when I use QT7 without :8080.\n\nI think it's due to mod_jk but I've no idea to make it work\n\n\nI've found that another person had a similar problem, but no answer was given :\nhttp://www.junlu.com/msg/107218.html\n\nThis message was posted in 09/2004 and it seems that Apache causes problems with pre-defined \nMIME-Types.\n\n\n\nDoes someone have an answer or an idea ? :-)\nI really need to fix this ! :(\n\nThanks in advance.  :o)\n\nRegards,\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me", "attachment_id": null, "id": 77419, "creator": "jerome.chauvin@opsomai.com", "time": "2005-07-19T10:07:17Z", "bug_id": 35791, "creation_time": "2005-07-19T10:07:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Please show where the Tomcat bug is (response dumps, etc): we're not going to\ninstall the crap that is quicktime simply to investigate this.
