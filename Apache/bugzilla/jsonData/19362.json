Next, I\ncopy the file to test.phtml, and now, very strangely, I get a textual display of\n\"<? phpinfo(); ?>\".  At first, I thought apache wasn't reading the second\nextension, so I added some more extensions: .php3 .php4, and a couple that\naren't normally used for php: .phtm .ptl.  I copied my test.php to\ntest.<all_those_extensions> and it worked for all of them, but still, not phtml.\n Finally, as some chance neuron made me do this: I addressed the file using my\nserver's FQDN: www.sbronner.com/test.phtml, instead of localhost, as I had been.\n Now, miraculously, it shows up perfectly.\n--\nSebastian J.
