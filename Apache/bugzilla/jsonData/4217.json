I just downloaded this .ZIP again to verify that the .class file is named .clas. It has nothing to do with the tar.gz. The actual filename is over 31 characters, which is an old Mac limitation. Mac OS X supports long filenames, but apparently StuffIt Expanded 6.5 does not (at least with .ZIP files). StuffIt automatically expands what you download, so you'll have to convince people to delete all that and go to the command line (even with .ZIP!).\n\nBesides renaming the file, it may be possible to distribute it in some other format (i.e. .DMG or .SIT) that doesn't run into this limitation.\n\nThere error reporting (in the default install) is really sad as well. Just a 404, until I look into the right logs, and then look into this bug database. Not listed as a common problem in the readme or anything... I tried Tomcat 4.0.1 months ago and gave up on it, then had the same problem in 4.0.3.\n", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 4217, "id": 13803, "time": "2002-04-16T22:44:55Z", "creator": "contact@nathany.com", "creation_time": "2002-04-16T22:44:55Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4217, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This is invalid (use GNU TAR).", "id": 35216, "time": "2003-04-15T15:54:58Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-15T15:54:58Z", "is_private": false}]
