[{"text": "Created attachment 35455\nJmeter test running after sample executed\n\nI'm using Jmeter to run a Selenium WebDriver test, everything seems ok, I only have 1 thread configured with 1 sec ramp up and 1 loop count, however after the webdriver execution is completed, Jmeter does not stops the overall test execution and keeps on executing the test for infinity, I'm not sure why is that happening, I'm using chromedriver and all the configuration I have done is as per jmeter documentation, I have also added WDS.sampleResult.sampleEnd() command at the end of my script. The execution does not even stops if I click Stop or Shutdown buttons explicitly.
