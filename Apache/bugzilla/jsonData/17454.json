[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I have run into a problem that will force me to downgrade from Apache 2.0.40 to \n1.3.27. I have used the <Files> and ForceType directives under 1.3.20 to allow \npassing script data via the URL to scripts without using query string (? at the \nend). It appears that since v. 2.0 the server no longer responds the same as \n1.3.*. The following sample URL would execute the script \"process\" in the \ndocument root running under 1.3.20 as mapped in .htaccess with a ForceType \ndirective:\n\nhttp://www.somedomain.com/process/datavalue1/datavalue2\n\nUnder 2.0.40 executing the URL above results in an Error 404. If I remove the \nextra parts after process it works. So the ForceType seems to be working. But \nthe way 2.0 is treating \"process\" as a directory instead of a file is troubling \nme.\n\nhttp://www.somedomain.com/process\n\nThe .htaccess file in the document root contains:\n\n<Files \"process\">\n  ForceType  application/x-httpd-php\n</Files>\n\nBut, not being able to pass arbitrary data after the \"process\" part so the \nscript can parse it defeats the purpose of URLs without query strings.\n\nIs this an oversight or a planned (undocumented) change in 2.0? I have searched \nthe bug DB and the change log and cannot find any info relating to this. I \nsearched Google groups and found several others reporting the same complaint.\n\nThank you", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 17454, "id": 32043, "time": "2003-02-26T21:10:14Z", "creator": "systematic1@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-02-26T21:10:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "attachment_id": null, "text": "It's quite simple.
