[{"count": 0, "text": "The spec says that a comma (,) in attribute u1 or u2 of element <hkern> or <vkern> needs to be specified as a Unicode range (or using g1 and g2), like <hkern u1=\"T\" u2=\"U+002C\" k=\"100\"/>. However, for compatibility with some old SVG viewer, it would be nice if a comma is recognized as literal character if u1 and/or u2 either contain only a comma as the only character (u2=\",\"), or if they start or end with two commas (e.g. u2=\",,.,;\") -- these seem to be unlikely cases for accidental typos.\n\nBoth u2=\"U+002C\" and u2=\"U+2c\" is recognized as a comma, but not u2=\"u+002c\". However, the example lex scanner in the appendix of the spec is case-insensitive, so maybe a lowercase u+ should also be recognized for compatibility?\n\nA workaround for authors might be to use u2=\",,U+002C\" which seems to work on both.", "bug_id": 44532, "attachment_id": null, "id": 114265, "time": "2008-03-04T10:45:55Z", "creator": "markus+asf@gyger.org", "creation_time": "2008-03-04T10:45:55Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
