If it is I think the docs need to be made clearer in that example and evaluateFormulaCell() method javadocs that it only works with formula cell types.\n\n(using POI 3.1-FINAL - but bugzilla doesn't have that version)"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "josh@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 121069, "time": "2008-09-29T16:15:45Z", "bug_id": 45768, "creation_time": "2008-09-29T16:15:45Z", "tags": [], "text": "You are right about the ambiguity.
