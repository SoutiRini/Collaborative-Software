[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55766, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Currently Ant's xslt task's xmlcatalog parameter element takes as its contents the location of the XML catalog file to be used.\n\nThe resolver itself (resolver.jar) can take a property file, typically called CatalogManager.properties.  Using this mechanism via Saxon (via a Java task) the resolver jar's location and the location of the property file are passed in.  Using it via Ant's xslt task the locations of the resolver and the catalog itself are passed in.\nIn Saxon if a catalog is to be used the location of the catalog is held within the properties file.\n\nI should like to be able to use a properties file when accessing XSLT via the xslt task.  My particular reason for this is that among the properties which may be set is a verbosity setting for the diagnostics.  At the moment I am having considerable problems getting the catalog to work and I would like to set the verbosity so that I can see from the resolver itself whether it is active and what it thinks it is doing.", "id": 171178, "time": "2013-11-11T12:32:03Z", "creator": "richardk.zz9@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-11-11T12:32:03Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 55766, "text": "would you like to create a patch for this bug report ?", "id": 171909, "time": "2013-12-23T17:57:53Z", "creator": "antoine@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-12-23T17:57:53Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
