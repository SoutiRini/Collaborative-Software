I have 3 tomcat instances 5.5.26 running on the same server. I wanted to connect Apache with Tomcat, So i downloaded mod_jk version 1.2.37 did a build from source on the server, this gave me mod_jk.so. After that i configured the hhtpd.conf and worker.properties file for mod_jk. But after that when i tried starting the Apache server, it failed to start giving the following error:\n\n\u201chttpd: Syntax error on line 148 of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf: Cannot load /etc/httpd/modules/mod_jk.so into server: /etc/httpd/modules/mod_jk.so: undefined symbol: ap_get_server_description\u201d\n\nI am not able to figure out the reason.

I m not sure if that can be the problem. I did looked in google and saw that this was a bug in apache 2.2.4 version and was fixed.\n\nIf possible can you please help me on following:\n\n1) Please tell some place where i can get mod_jk.so built for Apache 2.2.23. Is this possible?\n\n2)if not can you please tell if httpd-2.2.3-65.el5_8 is a different version to Apache 2.2.23. Actually i installed Apache from source but i still see a RPM httpd running on the server. I am confused if source installation adds the httpd to RPM database in the server? if that is the case then no problem but if not then you are right that the mod_jk.so got complied on a different version of apache.\n\nThanks a lot Eric for showing me the way.\n\nPlease do help me on the above two questions.\n\nThanks,\nShashi"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 164673, "time": "2013-01-16T15:47:33Z", "bug_id": 54429, "creation_time": "2013-01-16T15:47:33Z", "is_private": false, "text": "You might want to try for help on the users discussion lists."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "is_private": false, "id": 164723, "creation_time": "2013-01-18T11:32:47Z", "time": "2013-01-18T11:32:47Z", "bug_id": 54429, "text": "Or add the flag \"--enable-api-compatibility\" to configure when compiling mod_jk.", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "shashi.kumar280@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 6, "id": 164724, "time": "2013-01-18T13:06:33Z", "bug_id": 54429, "creation_time": "2013-01-18T13:06:33Z", "text": "(In reply to comment #5)\n> Or add the flag \"--enable-api-compatibility\" to configure when compiling\n> mod_jk.\n\nThanks Everyone,\n\nI have fixed that issue.
