Is this Apache documentation or mod_perl documentation?  Note that mod_perl has its own process for reporting issues, described on \n\nhttp://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/user/help/help.html#Reporting_Problems\n\nIf it is the Apache documentation, please let us know which page contains the incorrect information.  \n\nIf you tried to install and got stuck, please discuss the steps you took on the appropriate mailinglist before filing an issue."}]
