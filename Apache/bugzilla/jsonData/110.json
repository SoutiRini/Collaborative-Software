I have loaded all the OS patches per the sun and java sites. I have a couple classes which implement the Blowfish encryption algorithm using the JCE. These work standalone when compiled using javac and executed via java command line. Each works if the JCE is statically configured via the java.security file or dynamically via the addProvider() call. When I call these classes from a jsp using Tomcat I get an error \"Cannot set up certs for trusted CAs\" I have tried using various JVMs by setting the jvm.cfg file (Hotspot, et. al) Standalone things work fine, jsp compilation/execution from Tomcat errors. Any help is appreciated.\r\n"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 110, "attachment_id": null, "text": "There isn't enough detail to be worth trying to duplicate.
