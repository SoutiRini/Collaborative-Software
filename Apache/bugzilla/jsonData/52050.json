The class in attachement is my own implementation but the most important thing is the method calculateRate(double nper, double pmt, double pv, double fv, double type, double guess) that find root by using the Newton secant method.\nIn this way it'd be possible to easily adapt the code.\nI hope this will help the project with my few rows of code.\nFeel free to contact me for any detail.\nRegards,\nCarlo Traversa.", "id": 150718, "time": "2011-10-18T16:01:14Z", "bug_id": 52050, "creation_time": "2011-10-18T16:01:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52050, "text": "Thanks, applied (with a few tweaks) in r1186111.", "id": 150756, "time": "2011-10-19T11:32:56Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2011-10-19T11:32:56Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
