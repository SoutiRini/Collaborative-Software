Can't - it's in the spec. Plus it would be a bit of a back compat surprise.\n\nNext - create a new file - can't this is spec land. \n\nNext - use src/org/apache/taglibs/standard/tag/common/sql/ResultImpl.java directly rather than ResultSupport. Of course - that means people aren't using the spec anymore even if it is the same class (or copy of that class). Still - worth doing I think, so I've made that commit.\n\nNext is your RuntimeException, but that's another back compat surprise for people. \n\nHere's my change:\n\nsvn ci -m \"Adding constructors to ResultImpl to work around the SQLException hiding in ResultSupport - and noted this in ResultSupport as per #46086\" src\n\nSending        src/javax/servlet/jsp/jstl/sql/ResultSupport.java\nSending        src/org/apache/taglibs/standard/tag/common/sql/ResultImpl.java\nTransmitting file data ..\nCommitted revision 711123."}]
