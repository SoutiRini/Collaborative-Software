[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28816, "is_private": false, "text": "I encountered this problem last night and don't have an explanation for it. \n \nWe have a CGI program which is meant to send a response back to the user, \nclose stdout, and then continue processing.  These processes can take many \nhours, and we wish the user to have immediate confirmation.  We also find it \nvery useful to send the stderr output of these programs to the apache error \nlog.  This worked perfectly under 1.3.24, and appears to no longer work under \n2.0.49. \n \nIt appears that apache will no longer close the connection to the browser \nunless stderr is also closed by the detaching program.  This, of course, makes \nit impossible for us to send errors through the apache logging facility.  We \nwere able to work around this by sending the errors elsewhere, but it's a very \nsubtle change that proved very difficult to track down. \n \nThanks. \n \n--Russell", "id": 56943, "time": "2004-05-06T18:30:47Z", "creator": "rmiller@duskglow.com", "creation_time": "2004-05-06T18:30:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28816, "is_private": false, "text": "See latest update from Joe Orton to PR 22030 for code to try.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 22030 ***", "id": 56947, "time": "2004-05-06T19:20:31Z", "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-05-06T19:20:31Z", "attachment_id": null}]
