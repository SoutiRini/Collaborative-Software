Apparently, when \nI use an anchor tag for a file, and I click on the link, it does not show the \nfile download message  \"Do you want to open or save this file?\" with the open \nand save options.  Instead, it displays the file in the browser.  I know you \ncould normally save this information from the browser to a file, but I need it \nto show the download message because it's easier for users to save their \nfile.  I'm using Internet Explorer version 6, SP2.  I've also tried setting \nthe \"Confirm open after download\" check box for file types to no avail.  It \nuse to work in Tomcat 4.1.18.\n\n   Any help would be appreciated."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37671, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 82944, "time": "2005-11-28T22:46:46Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-11-28T22:46:46Z", "text": "*** Bug 37672 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37671, "text": "This is a configuration issue.
