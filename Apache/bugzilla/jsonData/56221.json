[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56221, "text": "Hi All,\nWe are testing apache tomcat release 7.0.52 , we are seeing a crash in the tomcat code.\nWe stepped through the issue and have found that it is failing in the Apache code when trying to initialize the logger, with the following error: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.ibatis.logging.slf4j.Slf4jImpl cannot be cast to org.apache.ibatis.logging.Log\n\nThis is occurring in LogFactory.java, in the setImplementation method, at the following line: Log log = candidate.newInstance(new Object[]{LogFactory.class});\n\nThis cast will successfully occur in 7.0.47 version of tomcat. We think they must have changed some hierarchy with regard to their logging but have as of yet been unable to track this down. Would somebody there with more expertise with regard to Tomcat be able to shed some light on the situation?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\nAnurag", "count": 0, "id": 173639, "time": "2014-03-05T18:08:21Z", "creator": "anurag_gujral@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2014-03-05T18:08:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56221, "text": "None of the quoted code involves Apache Tomcat.\n\nFurther, Bugzilla is not a support forum.\n\nThe Apache Tomcat users amiling list is the correct location for support questions but it is unclear form the information that this is even a Tomcat question.", "id": 173640, "time": "2014-03-05T18:14:11Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-03-05T18:14:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
