[{"text": "Created attachment 22913\nExample java class which domainstrates the bug.\n\nThere appears to be a bug in the way that Row.moveCell() is implemented.  After moving cells, if you attempt to reuse an index that had previously been moved, other data in the worksheet becomes corrupted.\n\nI've attached a sample java program to demonstrate this.  The example does the following steps:\n 1. Create a worksheet with a single row\n 2. Create 10 cells in indexes 0 to 9\n 3. Move all of those cells one to the right so that\n     a. Index 0 is blank\n     b. Indexes 1 to 10 are not populated\n 4. Create a new cell at index 0\n 5. Write out the results to disk.\n\nThe resulting file has a problem at index 1.  The file which results is blank at index 1.\n\nI've reproduced this in both 3.2 and 3.5-beta3", "tags": [], "bug_id": 46266, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 122731, "time": "2008-11-21T09:58:54Z", "creator": "brian@bazaarvoice.com", "creation_time": "2008-11-21T09:58:54Z", "attachment_id": 22913}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 23862\nA patch to address this behavior\n\nI was able to address this bug, and get the OP's test case to work with this patch.\n\nThanks!\n-Joe", "is_private": false, "id": 128213, "creator": "joeslice@gmail.com", "time": "2009-06-23T13:42:54Z", "bug_id": 46266, "creation_time": "2009-06-23T13:42:54Z", "attachment_id": 23862}, {"count": 2, "text": "Joe's patch does indeed work.
