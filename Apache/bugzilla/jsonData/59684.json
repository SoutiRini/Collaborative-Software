When creating the AreaReference the following is passed to CellReference.separateRefParts(String reference=\"HOME!$169\"). The CellRef is then set to the following values: _rowIndex = 169, _colIndex = -1, _sheetName = \"HOME\", _isRowAbs = false; _isColAbs = true; I believe _isRowAbs should be 'true' and _isColAbs should be 'false'. This happens because the '$' from reference gets parsed into parts.colRef instead of being parsed into parts.rowRef with the digits for the row number.", "id": 191498, "time": "2016-06-09T15:59:15Z", "creator": "sean.smitz@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-06-09T15:59:15Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59684, "attachment_id": null, "id": 191526, "time": "2016-06-10T11:56:06Z", "creator": "onealj@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-06-10T11:56:06Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for reporting this bug and giving some hints on where the problem was.
