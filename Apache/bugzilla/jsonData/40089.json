This bug manifests itself in\ncalls like webdavResource.listWebdavResources(): If a resource has a real '+' in\nthe name, it gets decoded to a space.\n\n(Tested with server: Apache mod_dav 2.2.2: PROPFIND returns a literal \"+\" for a\nliteral \"+\" in a path component.  Other WebDAV servers (ie: apache tomcat) seem\nto return plus as %2B to workaround problems in some of the client libraries\nlike this).\n\nReference: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2396.html, section 3.3 which seems to\nindicate that '+' is not reserved within path components.", "id": 91471, "time": "2006-07-21T18:54:07Z", "bug_id": 40089, "creation_time": "2006-07-21T18:54:07Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
