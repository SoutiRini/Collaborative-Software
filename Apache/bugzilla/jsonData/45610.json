In principle, all things work right. But if i (erroneously) set the empty value for the sub-worker tag (...&sw=&...), something completely wrong will happen: You'll got an \"OK\"-message and the sticky session attribute will be disabled!\n\nLooks to me like a typical overwriting of a parameter block through a dangling pointer.\n\nThere might be more of this kind of bugs, one may do a complete revision of the parameter parsing.", "id": 119669, "time": "2008-08-11T00:36:01Z", "bug_id": 45610, "creation_time": "2008-08-11T00:36:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Erroneous unsetting of sticky_session has been fixed in\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=893028&view=rev\n\nIt was not dangling pointer issue, simply a wrong handling of default values for sticky_session and sticky_session_force.\n\nBeing less tolerant for an empty sub worker param has been added in\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=893032&view=rev\n\nNote: this will only forbid \"sw=\" (no value) but not \"sw\" without \"=\".\n\nThanks for reporting the issue.
