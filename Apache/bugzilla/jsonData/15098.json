If format is null, will use a default output format.\n\nWARNING: FileWriter seems convenient, but it probably *won't* reliably do what \nyou think it will for this purpose and will likely fail when you least expect \nit. Use an OutputStreamWriter explicitly specifying UTF-8 as a Charset \ninstead. \n\nExample:\n\n// No, no, a billion times NO! --> FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);\nFileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file);\nCharset utf8 = Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\");\nOutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, utf8);\nXMLSerializer serializer = new XMLSerializer(writer, formatter);"}]
