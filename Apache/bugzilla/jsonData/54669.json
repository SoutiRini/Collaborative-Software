The existing property to do a full JVM\n    shutdown (jmeterengine.stopfail.system.exit) only executes when the\n    test is explicitly asked to stop. We needed to unconditionally insure\n    the JVM is terminated when the test was finished, even if the tests\n    themselves did things which left the JVM in a state where JMeter could\n    not cleanly exit in non-GUI mode.\n    \n    The new flag is \"jmeterengine.force.system.exit\" and defaults to\n    \"false\".\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/scotte/jmeter trunk\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/jmeter/pull/3.patch", "id": 165759, "time": "2013-03-11T18:56:48Z", "bug_id": 54669, "creation_time": "2013-03-11T18:56:48Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "Applied to SVN:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/r1455289\nLog:\nAdd flag forcing non-GUI JVM to exit after test\nBugzilla Id: 54669\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/bin/jmeter.properties\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/engine/StandardJMeterEngine.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 165760, "time": "2013-03-11T19:19:14Z", "bug_id": 54669, "creation_time": "2013-03-11T19:19:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
