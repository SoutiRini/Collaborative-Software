[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51331, "attachment_id": null, "text": "When running multiple iterations of a web request using SSL (HTTPS), the first request sets up a new SSL session, but subsequent requests by the same thread re-use the existing SSL session set up in the first iteration.  For example, testing 50,000 single requests by unique users can be tested by setting up 1000 threads with 50 iterations each.  However, because iterations 2 through 50 re-use the SSL session, the results do not represent a real-world multi-user scenario, since only 1000 SSL sessions are established instead of 50,000. \n\nIs it possible to start up new SSL sessions for each iteration instead of re-using existing sessions.  Or, if this is not possible, what would it take to add this option to JMeter?", "id": 146908, "time": "2011-06-07T02:50:27Z", "creator": "juhraffe@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2011-06-07T02:50:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51331, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.\n\nPlease subscribe to the JMeter user list and ask there.", "id": 146920, "time": "2011-06-07T10:18:03Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-06-07T10:18:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
