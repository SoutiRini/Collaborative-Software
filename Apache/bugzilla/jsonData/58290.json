It would be awesome to be able to access the jmeter-server via some HTTP calls. \n\nThis would open up a great number of scenarios with the backing power of jmeter. \n\nIf any projects like this exit, please point me in the right direction. If this could be directly in jmeter-server it would be great."}]
