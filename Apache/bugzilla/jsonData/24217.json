My project root directory is core. I have \nclasses folder under core, core/classes. Initially, I had log4j.xml file in the \nclasses folder. I invoked my JVM in classes folder. When I called the \nLogger.getLogger in my class, the LogManager for some reason didnot load the \nlog4j.xml as its default initial configuration and I could not use the defined \nloggers and appenders. But when I invoked the jvm by passing the \nlog4j.configuration=log4j.xml argument, it loaded my configuration. At this \nstage, I changed my configuration to log4j.properties and called the jvm in \nclasses without passing argument. At this stage it worked fine. FYI, I am using \n1.2.8.\nThanks\nRaj", "id": 46551, "time": "2003-10-30T21:38:04Z", "creator": "rpolikepati@uscentral.org", "creation_time": "2003-10-30T21:38:04Z", "is_private": false}]
