The reason for the change \nwas that in knowing the exact version, a hacker might be able to exploit a \nvulnerability known in that particular version.\n\nI know there are ways to hide the exact version by creating custom \nerrorLogValves and such, but it seems I should have to.  Also, I am not sure \nwhat all classes I need to override to get rid of all the version numbers.  \n\nThis may seem a minor point, but security folks love to make big issues out of \nminor points like this.\n\nI am not sure which Tomcat component this falls into, probably several since \nmany things handle their own error messages", "id": 65279, "time": "2004-10-18T14:43:48Z", "creator": "mac@donnell.com", "creation_time": "2004-10-18T14:43:48Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31758, "attachment_id": null, "id": 65280, "time": "2004-10-18T15:01:34Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-10-18T15:01:34Z", "is_private": false, "text": "You can do it already."}]
