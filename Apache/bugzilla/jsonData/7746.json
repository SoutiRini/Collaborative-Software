If you look at the 4.1 Spec, the escaping of WML is the same as\nWML, with one addition ($).  In WML they use $ to denote variables and a true $\nis represented as \"$$\".  This means if it isn't escaped a translation error will\noccur on the phone/emulator.\n\nI would suggest as HTML might not be the only output format of c:out that it be\nenhanced to be able to add more escapes to the list of escape mappings.

That is, JSTL is not designed to accommodate particular\n   markup languages beyond XML in general; it has been able to stay neutral\n   in this regard.\n\n   So the request you're making is really to introduce awareness of markup\n   lanugages like HTML and XML into JSTL tags.\n\n - Thanks for using Bugzilla, but it's for bugs in the reference implementation,\n   not suggestions for the spec.  To submit suggestions about the JSTL\n   spec, it's best to mail jsr-52-comments@jcp.org.\n\nThanks again."}]
