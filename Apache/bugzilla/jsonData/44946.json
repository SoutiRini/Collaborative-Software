However, the requests do not get forwarded to Tomcat.\n\nExpected Result:\nThe connector should be forwarding requests that match the entries in uriworkers.properties to the Tomcat instance specified by the matched worker.\n\nBuild & Platform:\nSetup: \n Win Server 2k3\n IIS 6.0\n Tomcat 5.5 (JBoss 4.0.4)\n isapi_redirect-1.2.26.dll\n isapi_redirect-1.2.25.dll\n isapi_redirect-1.2.15.dll\n IE 5,6 Firefox 2.0.0.14\n\nFurther Information:\nThe required information is already on the atlassian website, however it should probably be included in the core documentation at apache. Googling turns up more instances of people having this problem before returning atlassian's page.\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Setting+up+Confluence+with+IIS\n(Scroll down to the section titled IIS 6.0)\n\nSeverity:\nSet to normal as this only impacts a very specific configuration. However, in that configuration it's critical as it prevents any normal operation of the connector.", "attachment_id": 21928, "id": 116317, "creator": "lajatca@gmail.com", "time": "2008-05-06T21:35:07Z", "bug_id": 44946, "creation_time": "2008-05-06T21:35:07Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44946, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Many thanks for the patch.
