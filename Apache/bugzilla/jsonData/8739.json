My user base really needs this functionality.\n\nMy experience with this feature comes from using the perl module\nSpreadsheet::WriteExcel which does allow freezing.\n\nThe code to do this in the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module is:\n    my $workbook = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new($out_file);\n    my $worksheet = $workbook->addworksheet(\"Primers\");\n\n    # freeze the header row\n    $worksheet->freeze_panes(1, 0);\n\nHere is a snippet from the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel man page, if it is of use to\nyou when designing the API for it:\n\n  freeze_panes($row, $col, $top_row, $left_col)\n\n  This method can be used to divide a worksheet into horizontal or verti\u00ad\n  cal regions known as panes and to also \"freeze\" these panes so that the\n  splitter bars are not visible. This is the same as the `Window->Freeze\n  Panes' menu command in Excel\n\n  The parameters `$row' and `$col' are used to specify the location of the\n  split. It should be noted that the split is specified at the top or left\n  of a cell and that the method uses zero based indexing. Therefore to\n  freeze the first row of a worksheet it is necessary to specify the split\n  at row 2 (which is 1 as the zero-based index). This might lead you to\n  think that you are using a 1 based index but this is not the case.\n\n  You can set one of the `$row' and `$col' parameters as zero if you do\n  not want either a vertical or horizontal split.\n\n  Examples:\n\n      $worksheet->freeze_panes(1, 0); # Freeze the first row\n      $worksheet->freeze_panes('A2'); # Same using A1 notation\n      $worksheet->freeze_panes(0, 1); # Freeze the first column\n      $worksheet->freeze_panes('B1'); # Same using A1 notation\n      $worksheet->freeze_panes(1, 2); # Freeze first row and first 2 cols\n      $worksheet->freeze_panes('C2'); # Same using A1 notation\n\n  The parameters `$top_row' and `$left_col' are optional. They are used to\n  specify the top-most or left-most visible row or column in the scrolling\n  region of the panes. For example to freeze the first row and to have the\n  scrolling region begin at row twenty:\n\n      $worksheet->freeze_panes(1, 0, 20, 0);", "id": 15327, "time": "2002-05-02T12:50:02Z", "creator": "midpeter@slis.indiana.edu", "creation_time": "2002-05-02T12:50:02Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "poi-support@buni.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 15336, "time": "2002-05-02T15:13:33Z", "bug_id": 8739, "creation_time": "2002-05-02T15:13:33Z", "text": "Made RFE, annotated that it would be a 2.0 feature.
