Here is the text of that bug report:\n\n\nIn SRV.8.4 of the servlet spec it says:\n\n \"The path elements of the request object exposed to the target servlet must   \n  reflect the path used to obtain the RequestDispatcher. The only exception to \n  this is if the RequestDispatcher was obtained via the getNamedDispatcher \n  method.\"\n\nWith tomcat 4, if the request passed to forward has been wrapped\n(either by the current servlet/filter or by a previous servlet/filter) and that \nwrapper changes the value of the path methods - then the forward method exposes\nthe wrapped values rather than the values used to obtain the request \ndispatcher.\n\nThe Jetty container wraps the forwarded request and re-implements the path\nmethods so that the correct values are exposed."}]
