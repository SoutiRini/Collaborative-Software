I saw this exception arrived 2 times (in 2 differents\nprojects and replacing the option by validationQuery solved the problem).\n \nI suppose that the Tomcat documentation is followed by thousand of people\n(newcomers and others) so they will use the standard tomcat sample (with the\nautoReconnect option) and won't be aware that this option is not recommended.\n\nI set a \"minor\" severity but it may be \"trivial\", i don't know.\n\n[1]:http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html#Database%20Connection%20Pool%20(DBCP)%20Configurations \n[2]:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/connector-j-reference-configuration-properties.html\n[3]:http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Surviving+Connection+Closures", "is_private": false, "id": 131479, "creator": "reno.rkcrew@free.fr", "time": "2009-10-28T14:16:09Z", "bug_id": 48080, "creation_time": "2009-10-28T14:16:09Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 47235 ***", "id": 131653, "time": "2009-11-03T16:27:46Z", "bug_id": 48080, "creation_time": "2009-11-03T16:27:46Z", "attachment_id": null}]
