[{"count": 0, "text": "Hi There,\n\nI'm new to the Java World. I have some experience using PowerTier for EJB. \nThere used to be a problem with the Servlet Mill in PowerTier and I see the \nsame type of problem with Tomcat 3.2.3.\n\nI know that the reloadable in JSP is exploratory. I have 2 JSP Pages. The first \none includes the second. If I make changes to the second page and refresh my \nexplorer, the changes doesn't seem to take place. So every time I make a change \nto the second page, I will have to go back to the first page and make a small \nchange somewhere and save it again. Then it works.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThanx,\nDinesh, S.", "bug_id": 3168, "attachment_id": null, "id": 4635, "time": "2001-08-19T23:21:50Z", "creator": "dinesh@golisa.com", "creation_time": "2001-08-19T23:21:50Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 3168, "is_private": false, "text": "A fix is available ( in the experimental jasper repository ),  will be included\nin a future version of jasper.
