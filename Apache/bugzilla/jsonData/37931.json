The delete button seems to delete the\nparameter.  However, when the test plan is executed or when the user clicks back\non the Java Request sampler, the sample parameter reappears.  Since the Java\nRequest control panel always recreates deleted parameters, the Java Request\nDefaults are useless.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a test plan with a Thread Group.\n2. Add to the Thread Group a Java Request Defaults configuration element for\n   the SleepTest class and set the Sleep_Time parameter to 5000.\n3. Add to the Thread Group a Java Request sampler for the SleepTest class and\n   delete the SleepTime parameter.\n4. Click on the Java Request Defaults.\n5. Click on the Java Request sampler.  The SleepTime parameter has been restored\n   to the default value of 1000.\n6. Delete the value of the SleepTime parameter leaving the parameter in place.\n7. Click away and then back on the Java Request sampler.  The SleepTime\n   parameter has been restored to the default value of 1000.\n\nThe SleepTime value of 5000 in the Java Request Defaults can never be used."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Agreed - but not worth fixing (unless you can provide a patch)", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 37931, "id": 88677, "time": "2006-04-30T17:46:59Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-04-30T17:46:59Z", "attachment_id": null}]
