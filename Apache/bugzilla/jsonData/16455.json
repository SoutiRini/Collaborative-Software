Ideally\nAnt itself should create this file if it doesn't exist, and you can configure\nthe build.xml file to do that.  The problem is, if you have this line in your\nbuild.xml file--\n\n<!DOCTYPE project PUBLIC \"-\" \"ant.dtd\">\n\n--and if ant.dtd doesn't exist, Ant will not run.  At the same time, if you\nDON'T have that line in the build.xml file, various XML editing tools won't\nautomatically check your syntax, suggest tags, etc.\n\nSo, my suggestion is that you figure out how to turn off syntax checking when\nreading the build.xml file, even when a DTD is explicitly specified.\n\nDan Greening\ndan@greening.name"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16455, "attachment_id": null, "text": "How do the editors suggest tags without the DTD?
