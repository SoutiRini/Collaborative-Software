The old mod_jserv worked fine for us.\r\nThis happens sometimes when other cookies are sent to the server along with the JSESSIONID cookie.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the way the session route is searched in get_most_suitable_worker funtion in jk_lb_worker.c file - the programmer assumed that there is nothing in the string after the value of JSESSIONID\r\n"}]
