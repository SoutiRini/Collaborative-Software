[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56968, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I was learning Spring MVC framework by myself. I was using jdk 8.20 version, tomcat 8.0.9 version and eclipse luna. At first everything was working smoothly. But all of a sudden my tomcat server installed in eclipse stopped working. I was failed to run it using cmd or startup.bat too. Problem asked here. After that I tried myself and I changed the server. I used tomcat 7 and TomEE 1.7.0. Every time my server started smoothly, I installed the server in eclipse smoothly. But whenever I tried to create a project and run it, eclipse couldn't use the server anymore. Even after attempting to run a project, eclipse couldn't start it by start command. But the difference between tomcat8 and tomEE is I can now run it outside of eclipse using startup.bat. I also tried changing the port number,but that didn't work either. For tomEE first it showed unable to read zip file spring-core-4.0.6.RELEASE-javadoc. Then I replaced all the spring files, now it showing a container failed to start.
