(I'm assuming\nthat's $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac, but I tested with /usr/bin/javac, and with other\nversions of javac on my system. They all compile fine (when supplied with the\ncorrect classpath). The compiler does however give me the exact same errors I\nget through the webpage when supplied with no classpath.\n\nIts obvious the compiler is not getting the proper (any) classpath from Jasper.\nIs there a way of having Jasper report the classpath that its using for JSP\ncompilation?\n\nI doubt you've looked into this very thoroughly. I'd be very interested to know\nhow you came to that conclusion.\n\n", "bug_id": 42895, "is_private": false, "id": 105433, "time": "2007-07-15T05:45:13Z", "creator": "wshore3107@rogers.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-15T05:45:13Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
