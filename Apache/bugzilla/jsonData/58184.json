Besides, that would allow to easily distinguish them.\n\nPlease find attached three patches, one for each enhancement. The third one is the merge of the two features. The first patch requires Java 7 to work because of java.nio.file.Path#relativize(Path)."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 32938\nPatch: relativize include paths", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 58184, "id": 184194, "time": "2015-07-28T10:14:30Z", "creator": "angely.pro@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-07-28T10:14:30Z", "attachment_id": 32938}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58184, "attachment_id": 32939, "id": 184195, "time": "2015-07-28T10:15:36Z", "creator": "angely.pro@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-07-28T10:15:36Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 32939\nPatch: auto rename include controllers"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 184423, "time": "2015-08-08T17:12:00Z", "bug_id": 58184, "creation_time": "2015-08-08T17:12:00Z", "text": "Please use separate issues for the two different enhancements."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "angely.pro@gmail.com", "text": "Done:\nBug 58276 - Relativize include paths\nBug 58277 - Auto rename include controllers\nThanks.", "id": 184725, "time": "2015-08-24T07:58:34Z", "bug_id": 58184, "creation_time": "2015-08-24T07:58:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 58276 ***", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 58184, "id": 185602, "time": "2015-10-03T20:38:31Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2015-10-03T20:38:31Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58184, "text": "Also duplicated of 58277", "id": 185604, "time": "2015-10-03T20:39:10Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2015-10-03T20:39:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
