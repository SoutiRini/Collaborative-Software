The server is\napache2.0.47 with the mod_dav modules and runs under linux.\n\nThe first problem is that XP does not escape the '#' character with\na '%23' as part of the path segment.  This is a MicroSoft bug in XP as\nthe Win2K version seems to be better behaved.\n\nThe more serious problem is that the Apache server does not reject such\na request and but processes it with some nasty results.\n\nIn the following example, an authorized client/user has DELETE priviledges\non the webdav server.  The test file is \ncalled '/websites/davtest/#dav_test.html'\nwhich is a valid filename in linux, unix and MacOS worlds but not in Windows.\n\nWhen the DELETE submission is made by a Cadaver client or a Win2K client, the\nfollowing command is issued to the server\n    \"DELETE /websites/davtest/%23dav_test.html HTTP/1.1\"\neverything works as it should.\n\nHowever, when a DELETE submission is made by XP Pro, the server receives\n    \"DELETE /websites/davtest/#23dav_test.html\"\nwhich is doesn't escape the # character.  The server accepts the command\nand proceeds to delete the following\n    #23dav_test.html\n    all files in the /davtest directory\n    the parent directory (davtest).\n\nA server-based solution seems to be in order.\n\nThanks", "id": 41098, "time": "2003-07-21T18:57:30Z", "bug_id": 21779, "creation_time": "2003-07-21T18:57:30Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 21779, "text": "Thanks for the report - it is simple enough to reject these requests.", "id": 41103, "time": "2003-07-21T20:27:49Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2003-07-21T20:27:49Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 21779, "text": "*** Bug 22023 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 41865, "time": "2003-07-31T15:16:31Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-07-31T15:16:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "amit_athavale@lycos.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 49839, "time": "2003-12-30T08:42:01Z", "bug_id": 21779, "creation_time": "2003-12-30T08:42:01Z", "text": "I have a simple patch for this, where it checks non-null condition for\n\"r->parsed_uri.fragment\".
