Many of the changes were to variables that were not declared a private which means that \neliminating them may cause binary-compatibility problems though usually only limited to code that \ninserted itself into a org.apache.log4j package to access package visible members.\n\nThe two changes that were committed were to make NA_LOCATION_INFO final and changing the notify's in \nScheduler to notifyAll and synchronizing the close method.  Scheduler has been very problematic in the \nGump tests, use of notify might have been at least partially responsible.  I'm changing the title to reflect \nthe major effect of the change.\n\nCommitted rev 439177."}]
