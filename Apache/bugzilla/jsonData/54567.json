However,  I am going to assume that you are referring to a problem setting more than one print area on a sheet and have to say that I think this should be a feature request or enhancement and not a bug report.\n\nIf you use Excel itself, you should find that it is possible to create just a single print area on each worksheet. What Excel does allow you to do, however, is to add additional areas to an existing print area and this is why I think it should be a feature request and not a bug report. The API will need to be modified so that the setPrintArea() methods return an object that allows you to add other cell ranges to the print area, and a new method added to the Workbook class so that it is possible to get a reference to the print area object (if any) for a specific sheet.\n\nIn the meantime, can I ask which version of the file format are you targetting? The older binary (.xls) format or the newer OOXML (.xlsx) file format? If the latter, it may be possible to dig down into the openxml4j layer that underpins POI and work with the objects there. Having said that, I do not know if there is a class to model the print area at that level yet but do suspect there may be.", "count": 2, "id": 165281, "time": "2013-02-16T11:15:20Z", "bug_id": 54567, "creation_time": "2013-02-16T11:15:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54567, "text": "Assuming you were asking how to set multpile print areas on a sheet, tehn it is possible to do so using the current api.
