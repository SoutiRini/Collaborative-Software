Currently 1.2.0 is\nused and versions up to 1.2.3 are available under the old licence but nothing in\nthe release notes suggests that this issue has been fixed in those verisons (or\nin fact any later version).\n\nYou have several options:\n- get the latest JavaService and see if it has been fixed\n- if not, file a bug against JavaService and once fixed, use the new version\n- don't use unicode characters in your install path\n- use one of the many alternative service wrappers - Tomcat 5 uses Jakarta\nCommons Daemon and a Google search will find some more\n\nI am marking this as INVALID since the bug is in JavaService rather than Tomcat."}]
