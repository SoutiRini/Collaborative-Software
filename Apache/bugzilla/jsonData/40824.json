[{"text": "The documentation (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-\ndoc/config/context.html) encourages users to define their context's outside of \nthe server.xml file to enable hot-deployments.  The documentation also \nsays \"If you specify a context path of an empty string (\"\"), you are defining \nthe default web application for this Host, which will process all requests not \nassigned to other Contexts\"  Unfortunately, unless the context is defined \ninside the server.xml file, Tomcat doesn't recognize the empty string path \nvalue.  The workaround suggested on the user mailing list was:\nTo specify the default app, you must first delete the existing webapps/ROOT \ndirectory, then install your app in webapps/ROOT (or webapps/ROOT.war) or put \nyour <Context> element in conf/[engine]/[host]/ROOT.xml.\n\nThis bug is to request a single mechanism for specifying the default context \nregardless of if it's physically defined inside or outside of the server.xml \nfile.  \n\nThe dev mailing list indicated this is also how Tomcat 6 works.\nAlso bug# 40823 is a stop-gap solution to callout the workaround.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 40824, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 95131, "time": "2006-10-26T13:09:43Z", "creator": "jonwilmoth@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-26T13:09:43Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 95171, "time": "2006-10-27T18:24:23Z", "bug_id": 40824, "creation_time": "2006-10-27T18:24:23Z", "text": "The current behaviour is as designed and will not be changed.\n\nIt unfortunate that \"context path\" is easily confused with the path parameter of\nthe context element when they mean very different things.
