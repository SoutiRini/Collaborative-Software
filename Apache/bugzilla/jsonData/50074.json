Perhaps you're confusing context path (that which appears in a URL, using a slash as a separator) with file system path (which uses # as separator).  Note that expansion of a .war into a directory is done solely for the convenience of Tomcat; nothing in the servlet spec requires such action, so there should not be any expectations about the naming conventions used in such an expansion.\n\n - Chuck", "id": 140670, "time": "2010-10-11T13:47:08Z", "creator": "chuck.caldarale@unisys.com", "creation_time": "2010-10-11T13:47:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50074, "attachment_id": null, "id": 140675, "time": "2010-10-11T15:52:02Z", "creator": "keith.johnson@dmgfederal.com", "creation_time": "2010-10-11T15:52:02Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Understood, thanks for the clarification!"}]
