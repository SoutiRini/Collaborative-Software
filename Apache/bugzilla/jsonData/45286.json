[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "While dealing with basically the same problem as http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/modperl/modperl/97455 for https://sourceforge.net/projects/aepps, a lot of Googling and Source-reading brought me to the following solution:\n\n    AcceptFilter epp none\n    Listen 700 epp\n\n---------\n\nNow knowing the solution, I checked back to the official documentation for these two directives, and found that\n\n* http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#acceptfilter\n  does not somehow tell the reader how to set the protocol name for a socket.\n\n* http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/bind.html\n  does not contain any information regarding a possible second parameter which sets the protocol for this port.\n\n* I haven't found any hints as to what a connection-handler should do (e.g. call ap_set_server_protocol()?) to set the AcceptFilter or \"protocol\" field itself.\n\nPhew. \n\nWhat about adding to the \"Listen\" documentation something like\n\n\"Listen takes an optional second argument which sets the protocol name for this connection. An 'AcceptFilter' statement can then be used to set policies for this port\"\n\nand to the 'AcceptFilter', something like\n\n\"The default protocol names are https (for port 443) and http (for everything else). To set the protocol of a specific port, use the second parameter of the \"Listen\" directive.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 45286, "id": 118003, "time": "2008-06-26T03:46:47Z", "creator": "lendl@nic.at", "creation_time": "2008-06-26T03:46:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Moving docs bugs to docs@httpd.a.o ownership.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 45286, "id": 141226, "time": "2010-10-29T11:07:35Z", "creator": "rbowen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-29T11:07:35Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in trunk docs, r1031215.
