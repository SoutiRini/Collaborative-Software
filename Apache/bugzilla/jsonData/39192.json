[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "There is a problem with running HTTPS for name based virtual hosts. I\nknow that 'SSL wont work for name-based virtual hosts'\n[http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC47]. But it is known\nthat for name based virtual hosts Apache will always read the certificate set\nfor the fist vhost and this is ok for me, since I have just one\nwildcard certificate [*.mydomain.com] and I use it for all vhosts.\n\nIt seems to work properly with 5-7 virtual hosts. But when I try to\nadd another vhost with the same certificate Apache throws an error:\n\n[error] Oops, no RSA or DSA server certificate found for\n'vhost8.mydomain.com:0'?!\n\nI have no idea why there is a problem. All vhosts differ only with\nServerName and DocumentRoot. The rest of the configuration is the same\nand all vhosts have the same certificate. So why Apache tells me that\nit cannot find the certificate file when it already read it for the\nprevious seven vhosts?\n\nOS: FreeBSD 6\nApache: 2.2.0_7 (I got the same error with Apache 2.0)\n\nSample vhost config:\n\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n  ServerName vhost8.mydomain.com\n  DocumentRoot /home/www/vhost8\n  DirectoryIndex index.php index.html\n\n  SSLEngine on\n  SSLCertificateFile          /usr/local/etc/apache22/crt/server.crt\n  SSLCertificateKeyFile       /usr/local/etc/apache22/crt/server.key\n  SSLCACertificateFile        /usr/local/etc/apache22/crt/ca.crt\n</VirtualHost>", "attachment_id": null, "id": 87550, "creator": "jacek.chmielewski@gmail.com", "time": "2006-04-04T01:01:44Z", "bug_id": 39192, "creation_time": "2006-04-04T01:01:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "The configuration should use \"ServerName vhost8.mydomain.com:443\" at least; not\nsure otherwise why this should actually fail.
