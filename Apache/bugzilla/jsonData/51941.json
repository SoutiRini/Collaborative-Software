For example, you may want to sum the number of a particular product that customers have ordered over a period of time, such as by quarterly periods. If worksheets are formatted in the same way for each period, the total sales for the product always appears in the same cell in each worksheet.\n \nFinding the sum in this situation is simple. You can use a formula:\n 1.Start Excel. A new, blank workbook appears.\n2.In cell B3 in Sheet1, type 20.\n3.In cell B3 in both Sheet2 and Sheet3, type 30.\n4.In cell A1 in Sheet1, type the following formula:\n=SUM(Sheet1:Sheet3!B3)\n5.Press ENTER.
