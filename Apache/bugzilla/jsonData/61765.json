For now only \"Workbook\", \"WORKBOOK\" and \"BOOK\" is used.\nIt would be nice, if \"WorkBook\" could be added asap to the WORKBOOK_DIR_ENTRY_NAMES enum in InternalWorkbook.java\n\nBtw. I do not know how this xls file was created and because of non-disclosure I can not provide it.\n\nI attached a SVN patch file (created with Eclipse).", "id": 202140, "time": "2017-11-15T09:19:02Z", "creator": "robert.blank@amsonline.de", "creation_time": "2017-11-15T09:19:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks, applied in r1817812.", "id": 202725, "time": "2017-12-11T19:53:12Z", "bug_id": 61765, "creation_time": "2017-12-11T19:53:12Z", "is_private": false}]
