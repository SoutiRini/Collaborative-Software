See bug 59836 if you're curious. Enums are safer, faster (checked at compile time instead of runtime--if checked at all), require less code, and give more informative error messages (enum name instead of integer code), and easier to use. They also make the POI API more flexible since users are unable to hard-code integer literals in place of enums.\nFinally, it makes the method signatures easier to read.\n\nIf you have code that is tripping these warnings that is originating from POI code, post it here so we can fix it (it may not be possible without breaking backwards compatibility, in which case we'll defer those changes).\n\nIf the code that is tripping these warnings comes from your code, consider upgrading that code to use enums.\n\nYou could also choose to ignore the POI log, change the logger level (log.check), or have your logger write to a different destination if it's causing you problems. Suppressing the problem now will make it more difficult to update down the road. Your call, but not a call that I would want to make for all users.
