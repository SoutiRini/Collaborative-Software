But are you sure it is correct behaviour?\n\nFor example, I selected diapason from 1st sampler to 2nd with expanded 1st\nsampler element for copying:\n-ThreadGroup\n+-If Controller\n+-1st HTTP Sampler (selected from)\n+--Assertion \n+-2nd HTTP Sampler (selected to)\n\nAs for me it is not clear that Assertion element will be pasted twice. I can't\nremember any tree which works like this. And can you give the example when this\nis useful? It is necessary to write additional documentation for supporting this\nfeature.\n\nAnd I had a bug in my test plan after this operation. Because additional\nelements were pasted in my plan. :)\n\nIMHO this logic is rather confused."}]
