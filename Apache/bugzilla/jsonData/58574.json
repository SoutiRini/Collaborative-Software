I have an API working on https://mydomain.test/rest.php\n\nEverything goes well but for each call to my API, there is a new line in my apache error.log. Example: call GET \"https://mydomain.test/rest.php/Test\"\n\nIt works, but add this line in the apache error.log:\n\n[Mon Nov 02 15:06:58.056250 2015] [authz_core:error] [pid 17148] [client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:52446] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /var/www/html/myproject/front/Test\n\nMy project is located at /var/www/html/myproject.\n\nHere is my apache configuration:\n\n\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\n<VirtualHost _default_:443>\n    ServerAdmin support@mydomain.test\n    ServerName mydomain.test\n\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/myproject/front\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n    SSLEngine on\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/my.crt\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/my.key\n    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/mychain.crt\n\n\n    <FilesMatch \"\\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$\">\n            SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\n    </FilesMatch>\n    <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>\n            SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\n    </Directory>\n\n\n    BrowserMatch \"MSIE [2-6]\" \\\n            nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \\\n            downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\n    # MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive\n    BrowserMatch \"MSIE [17-9]\" ssl-unclean-shutdown\n\n\n    <Directory /var/www/html/myproject/>\n        Require all denied\n    </Directory>\n\n    <Directory /var/www/html/myproject/front/>\n        Require all denied\n\n        <Files rest.php>\n                Require all granted\n        </Files>\n    </Directory>\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nWhile searching for solution I found some people having same trouble, but every solutions mentioned was to ignore the line, or reduce the log level (this is not an option in my case ;).\n\nI noticed that apache is stripping the \"rest.php\" from the path, but i can't figured it out.
