When Tomcat first starts up, \nthings go OK, but then after accessing a few pages the site will \"hang\".  When \nI switched back to the HTTP1.1 test connection, this behavior disappears.  A \ncouple clues:  The duration of the \"hang\" was exactly the length of the \nconnection timeout I had set.  I set the connectionTimeout to 60 seconds -- \nhang for 60 seconds until I recieved a response.  Then I set it for 3 seconds \nand it took 3 seconds for Tomcat to respond.  Furthermore this behavior only \nhappens on the basic-authentication part of my site.  Pages with no \nauthentication at all do not hang."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11116, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Using the manager works for me (it uses BASIC), using a standards compliant\nbrowser.
