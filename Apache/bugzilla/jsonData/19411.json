When I deliberately retrieves an\ninvalid node, say /files/john/resources/invalid-folder, root and john get\ndifferent exceptions.  For root, we get ObjectNotFoundException, as expected. \nFor john, we get AccessDeniedException!!!\n\norg.apache.slide.security.AccessDeniedException: Access denied on / by user\n/users/john for action /actions/read\n  at org.apache.slide.security.SecurityImpl.checkCredentials(SecurityImpl.java:389)\n  at org.apache.slide.structure.StructureImpl.retrieve(StructureImpl.java:226)\n  at org.apache.slide.structure.StructureImpl.retrieve(StructureImpl.java:170)\n\n\nA workaround is to grant john /actions/read along /, /files, /john.
