Some pending cleanup and discussion on whether to reimplement in Tomcat 8 is tracked as bug 56199.\n\n\nIf you are using validateXml=\"false\", my recommendation is to just remove that attribute from your build files. (It does not serve anything, as \"false\" is the default value for this attribute).\n\n\nA backport of r1570163 has been proposed for 6.0"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 173942, "time": "2014-03-19T15:04:47Z", "bug_id": 56208, "creation_time": "2014-03-19T15:04:47Z", "tags": [], "text": "This has been fixed in 6.0.x and will be included 6.0.40."}]
