That is, one request receives a \nresponse that should have been returned to another request.\n\nFor example, page1.jsp is requested by one thread at the same time as page2.jsp \nis requested by another, and page1.jsp is returned to both HTTP requests.\n\nThe HTTP requests were being made to a WebSphere Commerce Server application, \nrunning on WebSphere Application Server 4.0.3 on Solaris 9.0, via an iPlanet \nWeb Server (Enterprise Edition 6.0). The JMeter Thread Group was using a HTTP \nCookie Manager to store a cookie with a JSESSIONID to maintain session state \nfor the application.\n\nThis same problem was found when running JMeter on two seperate machines with \njust one thread each. And again when running one JMeter thread on one machine \nand a Web Browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) on another machine. However, this \ncould not be repeated via browser only testing, even with multiple concurrent \nbrowser requests."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19021, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 35990, "time": "2003-04-24T16:27:17Z", "creator": "mstover1@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-24T16:27:17Z", "text": "I can't make this happen.
