[{"text": "Created attachment 29862\nPatch to enable the described functionality\n\nThe use case is the following:\n\nTesting a typical eShop solution with the following steps:\n1. load the main page\n2. Select the browse product catalog link\n3. select a random product from the product list\n4. Open the selected product detail page\n\nThe third step could be defined in JMeter using a Random Variable from 1 to N\nand using the XPathExtractor Post Processor for example with the following XPath\n\"//div[@class=\"product\" and position()=${selectedProductNum}]/a/@href\"\nThe ${selectedProductNum} varibale is the random generated number and should be replaced in the XPath.\n\nFor me in the specified version it was not working by default.\nI created a simple patch which modifies the \"components/org/apache/jmeter/extractor/XPathExtractor.java\". I rebuilt the 2.9-SNAPSHOT version from SVN and it is working for me. \n\nPlease consider to apply this patch for the current version if you found it useful.\n\nBest regards", "tags": [], "creator": "jmeter.contrib@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 29862, "count": 0, "id": 164709, "time": "2013-01-17T18:22:34Z", "bug_id": 54447, "creation_time": "2013-01-17T18:22:34Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "is_private": false, "id": 164713, "creation_time": "2013-01-17T21:12:12Z", "time": "2013-01-17T21:12:12Z", "bug_id": 54447, "text": "Created attachment 29864\nTest Plan showing it works\n\nHello,\nThanks for patch but I don't understand what it is supposed to fix as what you are explaining works for me.\n\nSee attached test plan.\nCan you clarify please ?\n\nRegards\nPhilippe", "attachment_id": 29864}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nI retested the functionality with the original(2.8) JAR versions and it looks fine.
