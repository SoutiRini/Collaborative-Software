[{"text": "Created attachment 31176\nAdds application/ld+json to mime.types\n\nJSON-LD's media type has been registered at IANA already quite some time ago and the specification at W3C already reached Proposed Recommendation status. It is expected to become a proper Recommendation next week. Given that it is already used in the wild, I think it would be time to add its media type to mime.types. I've added a patch for trunk but this should also be backported to 2.4. Let me know if you want me to either create a separate ticket for that or add another patch.\n\nThanks,\nMarkus", "tags": [], "creator": "mark_lanthaler@gmx.net", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 172140, "time": "2014-01-07T09:40:00Z", "bug_id": 55963, "creation_time": "2014-01-07T09:40:00Z", "attachment_id": 31176}]
