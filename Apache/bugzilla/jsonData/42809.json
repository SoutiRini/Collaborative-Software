Also added hasId() convenience method.\n\n* BasicLinkLayoutManager makes use of new BasicLink\nhas(Internal|External)Destination() convenience methods.\n\n* Removed List blockLists argument from the AbstractBreaker/PageBreaker\ngetNextBlockList() protected method as its only usage is the AbstractBreaker\nblockLists member variable.", "id": 105067, "time": "2007-07-04T09:31:32Z", "creator": "dev@cumiskey.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-04T09:31:32Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42809, "attachment_id": 20446, "text": "Created attachment 20446\npatch file", "id": 105068, "time": "2007-07-04T09:32:04Z", "creator": "dev@cumiskey.com", "creation_time": "2007-07-04T09:32:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "dev@cumiskey.com", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 20447\nfile list", "id": 105069, "time": "2007-07-04T09:32:29Z", "bug_id": 42809, "creation_time": "2007-07-04T09:32:29Z", "attachment_id": 20447}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 42809, "is_private": false, "text": "I liked it... very much :)\n\nPatch applied. see: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=554094\n\nNice work, Adrian!", "id": 105154, "time": "2007-07-06T17:05:50Z", "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-07-06T17:05:50Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 155585, "time": "2012-04-01T06:29:18Z", "bug_id": 42809, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:29:18Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
