[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi support,\n\nI tested an reproduced the CAN-2003-0017 vulnerability : \"On Windows platforms \nApache could be forced to serve unexpected files by appending illegal \ncharacters such as '<' to the request URL\" fixed in 2.0.44.\nI made a 2.0.43 default installation on a Win2K SP2 box. By appending \"<<\" at \nthe end of a request, I can list and view files on a directory. Here is how I \nproceed: I first try \"http://target/directory/a<<\". Is there is one or more \nfiles starting by character \"a\", then I get one of these files ( always the \nsame but I do not know which one ). If I get an error back, then I try with the \nnext letter and so on until I get a file back, say \"f\". To get the exact \nfilename, I restart the process but with 2 letter this time \ni.e. \"http://target/directory/fa<<\". If a filename starts with \"fa\", I get it, \notherwise I get an error. And so on until I get the filename let \nsay \"fat.html\". Note that to be sure you do not miss any file in the directory, \nyou need to try one character more than filename length \n(fat.htmla\", \"fat.htmlb\"... ).\nUsing this algorithm, I can list and view the all files on a directory. This \ngoes beyond the unexpected file disclosure described in the release note of \n2.0.44 and I thought you needed to be aware of it.\nI tested version 2.0.44 and as expected, it is not vulnerable.\nRegards.\n\nBernard Margelin, Security Watch Manager at Vigilante, Toulouse\nTelephone (33) 5 62 57 70 16\nemail bernard.margelin@vigilante.com", "is_private": false, "id": 29942, "creator": "bernard.margelin@vigilante.com", "time": "2003-01-23T15:18:47Z", "bug_id": 16366, "creation_time": "2003-01-23T15:18:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16366, "attachment_id": null, "text": "And so you're reporting this as a bug because??
