This is a known bug:\n\n- The alignment only works well if you use a <fo:character> for the character in the other font, as fop currently uses the same alignmentcontext for the same element. I've looked into this once, and will probably do it again, but it would need some time.\n\n- the \"X\", where X is your character in the other font is due to the way font-selection is implemented in fop (word-by-word, see webpage). Character-by-character is not yet supported (due the issue mentioned above).\n\nWe'll leave this bug open as a reminder.\n\nMax", "id": 124921, "time": "2009-02-18T04:12:01Z", "bug_id": 46720, "creation_time": "2009-02-18T04:12:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46720, "attachment_id": null, "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review", "id": 157414, "time": "2012-04-07T01:42:38Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:42:38Z", "is_private": false}]
