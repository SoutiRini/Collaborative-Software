[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4304, "text": "The version of Xalan that is required by the XSL taglib is not clear, nor is the version that is included with the taglib clear.  Installing the current version of Xalan available from xml.apache.org, 2.2.D11 (and the version of Xerces included with that package), doesn't seem to work with the taglib file - it throws a SAX exception attempting to use an apply tag like:\n\n<xsl:apply xml=\"file.xml\" xsl=\"file.xsl\"/>\n\nThis is using Tomcat 4.0.1, Xalan 2.2.D11 (with the version of Xerces included with this release of Xalan, plus using the xalanj1compat.jar file included in the /bin directory of the Xalan dist), JDK 1.3.1_01, and the XSL taglib nightly build from 18-Oct-2001.  If the Xalan and Xerces files that are included with the taglib are used, though, things work ok.\n\nWhat I would like to see is this:\n1.) Clear labeling of the version of Xalan / Xerces included in the xsl-examples.war application file.\n2.) Updated documentation, in the xsl-doc.war application file, to reflect the change from InsertWithXSL to apply for the tag to include transformed XML.\n3.) Nice support for the current version of Xalan (v2), instead of the (I'm guessing?) an old version (v1).", "id": 6926, "time": "2001-10-19T20:42:02Z", "creator": "apache-bugzilla@mmmbop.net", "creation_time": "2001-10-19T20:42:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the feedback, sorry it took so long to get back to you.\nNo one has been maintaining this taglib.\n\nI have overhauled the documentation to handle items 1&2.\n\nFor Xalan 2 compatability I recommend using the XTAGS or Standard taglib.\nThe XSL taglib will be deprecated in the future, and these two taglibs\nhave more features for handling XSL.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 12918, "creator": "glenn@apache.org", "time": "2002-04-06T16:03:01Z", "bug_id": 4304, "creation_time": "2002-04-06T16:03:01Z", "is_private": false}]
