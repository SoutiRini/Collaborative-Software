I think that solves bug 32184, because now it is easy to specify what\nstatic content you want to avoid in the test plan.\n\nI'm not quite sure that the following lines are correct :\n// Default value\ncontentTypeInclude.setText(JMeterUtils.getProperty(\"proxy.content_type_include\"));\n\n\nand\n\n// Default value\ncontentTypeExclude.setText(JMeterUtils.getProperty(\"proxy.content_type_exclude\"));\n\n\nSo please check if this is the correct way of picking up default values from\nthe properties file.\n\nI have also restructured the GUI slightly from the fix for bug 41876. I have\nmoved the \"controller\" and \"group\" settings inside the \"Test plan content\"\ngroup. And I have used VerticalPanel with titles, which I think makes it look\nnice. Have a look, and apply that GUI change if you like it.\n\nI have also added resource strings which was missed in fix for bug 41876.\n\nI am also using the resource string from the HTTPSamplerGui for the options\nthat control the HTTPSamplerGUI, instead of having separate strings for the\nsame thing as proxy_* in the resource files. So I have removed\n\"proxy_usekeepalive\".\n\nAnd I have added \"URL\" prefix to the value of patterns_to_exclude,\npatterns_to_include in all languages, because I think that makes it more clear\nwhat the filer is applied against.
