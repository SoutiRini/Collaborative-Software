The flag that needs turning off is in fact deployOnStartup.

The help on Automatic \nApplication Deployment is misleading (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-\n5.0-doc/config/host.html#Automatic%20Application%20Deployment).\n\n1. I think the first action happens even when deployOnStartup is false - I \ndidn't try this attribute because I thought it would stop things deploying on \nstartup but it doesn't. Actually it solves the problem I was having by only \ndeploying things from context files in \n$CATALINA_HOME/conf/[engine_name]/[host_name], but doesn't deploy things from \nappBase.\n2. Should the second action read \"Any web application archive file <ins>within \nthe application base directory</ins> that does not have a corresponding \ndirectory of the same name...\"\n3. The paragraph starting \"In addition to the automatic deployment\" doesn't \nmention the attribute \"autoDeploy\" but I think this is what it is referring to.\n4. The last paragraph starting \"When using automatic deployment,\" doesn't \nreflect the fact that if you upload a war file, the docBase attribute is \nignored and the file goes in the appBase directory. Hence you get double \ndeployment on restart unless you disable deployOnStartup\n\nI accept that this was in fact a configuration issue but hopefully the \ndocumentation can be made clearer.\n\nThanks"}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "is_private": false, "id": 63900, "time": "2004-09-20T18:31:13Z", "bug_id": 31277, "creation_time": "2004-09-20T18:31:13Z", "tags": [], "text": "OK, doc clarified (for 5.0.29 and 5.5.3)."}]
