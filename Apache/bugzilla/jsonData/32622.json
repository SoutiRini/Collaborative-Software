[{"count": 0, "text": "When using auto negotation then timefmt seems to be ignored.\nI use the following sequence:\n\n<!--#config timefmt=\"%d.%m.%Y\" --><!--#echo var=\"LAST_MODIFIED\" -->\n\nThe files are named like file.html.de and file.html.en, the first declares\n<meta name=\"content-language\" content=\"de\">, the second\n<meta name=\"content-language\" content=\"en\">.

The date is shown by both files\nin the requested format (e.g. 10.12.2004).\nBut if I call http://server/file.html then because of my browsers (mozilla)\npreferences the file.html.de page is shown.
