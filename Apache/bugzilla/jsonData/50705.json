The issues is as follows; if you define a combination of TLEs and NOPs in the simple-page-master, regardless of the order, FOP will print the TLEs first then the NOPs. \n\nThe reason is because they're held in different ArrayLists in o.a.f.afp.modca.AbstractPageObject. Why it has been done this way? I don't know, there may be a perfectly good reason I'm not aware of. But since they derive from a common ancestor (AbstractStructuredObject), I've removed the list that stores the TLEs separately, so that TLEs and NOPs are stored in the same ArrayList. This means that the TLEs and NOPs are printed in the order they appear in the FO.", "id": 143889, "time": "2011-02-02T03:48:05Z", "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2011-02-02T03:48:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 26593}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 26594\nTest case\n\nThis is the test case for this bug", "id": 143890, "attachment_id": 26594, "bug_id": 50705, "creation_time": "2011-02-02T03:48:55Z", "time": "2011-02-02T03:48:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "On second thoughts, attaching before and after AFPs seems redundant, if anyone requests them, I'll be happy to post them here", "id": 143891, "time": "2011-02-02T03:49:55Z", "bug_id": 50705, "creation_time": "2011-02-02T03:49:55Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50705, "text": "Patch applied.
