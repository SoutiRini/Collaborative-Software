[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hello everyone.\nI was analyzing the modularization of some classes, and I identified that the class JMeterUtils has an opportunity for cohesion improvement. \nThe class SaveService was in the same situation and the problem was solved as follows: The OldSaveService class was created, and several get() and set() methods that were used only to configure the class parameters were moved from SaveService to OldSaveService. \nThe new class was then accessed through an instance variable in SaveService. This strategy has cleaned and improved SaveService cohesion.\nWith this in mind, I would recommend creating a new class: JMeterUtilsConfig , and moving the following methods:\n\ngetLocalHostDetails\ngetParsedLabel\ngetResStringDefault\ngetJMeterCopyright\ngetPatternCache\nsetLocale\ngetResString\ngetResourceFileAsText\ngetSearchPaths\ngetHashtable\ngetJMeterHome\ngetLocale\ngetPattern\ngetLocaleString\ngetProperty\ngetJMeterBinDir\ngetMatcher\ngetVisualizers\ngetJMeterVersion\ngetVector\ngetLocalHostIP\ngetXMLParser\ngetPropDefault\ngetAlias\nsetProperty\ngetControllers\ngetHiDPIScaleFactor\ngetHiDPIMode\ngetTestSamples\ngetImage\nsetJMeterHome\ngetJMeterProperties\ngetLocalHostName\ngetLocalHostFullName\ngetRandomInt\ngetTimers\ngetProperties\n\nfrom the JMeterUtils.\nThose parameters accessed by an instance variable in the JMeterUtils.\nMoreover, the orthogonality is the design would be enhanced.\n\nWhat do you think about that?", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 61308, "id": 199818, "time": "2017-07-16T13:36:08Z", "creator": "lemesmachado@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-07-16T13:36:08Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for proposal, but approach seems to theorical for me and we have to make some choices regarding our time.\nUnless you propose a PR and impact does not break all plugins , I doubt we will move on this.\nClosing as WONTFIX.\n\nThank you", "attachment_id": null, "id": 200597, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2017-09-02T19:15:35Z", "bug_id": 61308, "creation_time": "2017-09-02T19:15:35Z", "is_private": false}]
