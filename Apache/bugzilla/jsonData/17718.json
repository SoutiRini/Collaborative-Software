The problem is that I got the message(in browser) \"document contained no data\" when I tried to upload a big file(500Mb). With small files I got no error. The browser I used is Netscape 4.79. I tried with IE and the upload worked fine for both small and big files.\n\nI put error_log to debug level and I got following info:\n\n[Tue Mar  4 10:22:15 2003] [info] [client 207.33.129.85] read script header timed out\n\n\n\nI don't kmnow if this error comes form Apache but maybe you can help me with some ideas.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nCalin", "id": 32553, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "trcalin@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-03-06T13:20:49Z", "time": "2003-03-06T13:20:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "satch@satchell.net", "text": "In working with file upload, I experimented with both Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.0\nwith a wide variety of file length.
