I didn't change temp directory, \nand As I wrote above I've tried to change permissions to every imaginable \ndirectories. AFAIK WinXP has MSI 3.0 as its default installer. I actually \ntried also version 3.1 which is available from Microsoft Download Center. I \ntried both .exe and .msi. But...\n\nToday I re-installed Windows XP (+SP2) and I believe I've found what was wrong \nwith me: F-Secure Anti-Virus. I'm quite sure about it because today I \ninstalled Windows actually twice. On the first attempt I installed anti-virus \nimmediately before installing anything else and installation was interrupted. \nI removed the anti-virus software and it didn't help. So, because I really \nwanted to have Apache installed, I re-installed windows and installed the \nserver as the first thing and this time it worked.\n\nTherefore I believe that F-Secure Anti-Virus possibly is doing some nasty \nthings which won't be removed although you remove the software.\n\nWindows was installed with a typical setup.
