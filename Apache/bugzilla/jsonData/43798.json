Authentication and autorization are two \ndifferent functions.  Since the LDAP URL was specified in an \n<AuthnProviderAlias> section, the directives in that section only apply to \nauthentication or Authn.  They do not apply to authorization or authz.  \nTherefore, an LDAP URL still needs to be defined if the authorization \nfunctionality requires it such as in an 'require ldap-group xxx' situation.  \nThe unfortunate thing is that this is not intuitive in apache 2.2. It will \nmake a little more sense in Apache 2.4 when the directive section \n<RequireAlias ... > is introduced.  This will allow both the authentication \nand authorization functionality to be independently configured with separate \nLDAP information if desired.  An equivalent <RequireAlias> would appear as:\n\n<RequireAlias ldap-group my-ldap-group cn=xxx,ou=groups,dc=xxx,dc=fr>\n   AuthLDAPURL ldap://xxx/ou=people,dc=xxx,dc=fr \n   ...\n</RequireAlias>\n\n<Directory ..>\n   ...\n   Require my-ldap-group\n</Directory>"}]
