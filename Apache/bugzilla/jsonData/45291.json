[{"count": 0, "text": "Created attachment 22184\nProposed updates to 1.3 copy of win32/thread.c\n\nI was trying to locate memory leaks while running an application on Windows and found that the apr_thread_t allocated w/in apr_thread_create() is never freed.\n\nThis leak is noticable when the process has lots of transient threads.  In my case the transient threads are managed by the thread pooling support in apr_thread_pool.c.\n\nIn a test copy I updated apr_thread_create() to allocate the apr_thread_t out of the pool created by apr_thread_create().  apr_thread_exit() and apr_thread_join() had to be updated as well.  I will attach a diff of the changes.\n\nThe updates assume that the thread creator will call either apr_thread_detach() followed by apr_thread_exit() or apr_thread_join() to clean up the thread.", "bug_id": 45291, "attachment_id": 22184, "id": 118036, "time": "2008-06-26T14:39:05Z", "creator": "Joe.Mudd@sas.com", "creation_time": "2008-06-26T14:39:05Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
