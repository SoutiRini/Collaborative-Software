I can reproduce this by\nediting the test-cgi script provided with apache and adding several lines like this:\n\nexport 1>&2\n\nif there's enough of these lines, you get a lock up.\n\nit seems that apache waits to read all of the output on stdout of the CGI script\nbefore even looking at stderr. so if you write enough bytes to stderr to\noverflow the pipe buffer to httpd, the CGI process will lock up waiting to write\nto stderr and the httpd process will lock up waiting for EOF on the CGI's\nstdout. this is system dependent because the size of the pipe buffers differs\nfrom system to system. I've seen this problem on solaris and irix.\n\nis there a way to tell apache to not intercept stderr and let it go directly to\nthe error_log?\n\nthanks\n\nlefteris"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 59139, "time": "2004-06-11T22:58:06Z", "bug_id": 29533, "creation_time": "2004-06-11T22:58:06Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 22030 ***"}]
