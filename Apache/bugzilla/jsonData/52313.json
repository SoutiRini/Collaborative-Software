This is OK as far as you want to use DBM files for AuthType Basic. But with AuthType Digest, a colon is needed to separate user name and realm.\n\n* Though the underlying DBM routines allow to do so, htdbm does not offer a way\nto add an entry only if the entry does not exist. This causes race conditions if multiple applications want to add only new entries using htdbm.\n\n* htdbm does not offer a way to extract a value.\n\nThe appending patch solves all three problems for me, by adding options:\n\n-a allows colons in the username.\n\n-k keeps existing entries when you try to add an entry.\n\n-w can be used together with -v to write the database entry to stdout. (The entry is always written even if verification fails, thus you can say \"htdbm -vwb dbmfile user dummy\" to get the DBM entry and disregard the exit code.)", "id": 152101, "time": "2011-12-09T16:26:36Z", "bug_id": 52313, "creation_time": "2011-12-09T16:26:36Z", "attachment_id": 28059}]
