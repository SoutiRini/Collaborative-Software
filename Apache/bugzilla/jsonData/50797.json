This includes verifying that error messages are correctly provided by the server.\n\nUnfortunately, (at least with the SMTP Sampler) when the server replies with an error message, the sample is automatically marked as failed, and there is no way around it.\n\nMy request for enhancement would be to add a flag that would not fail the sample in case of an error. In the SMTP example I could select this flag and then add an Assertion to verify the response code the server provided.\n\nFor instance, when the SMTP server is provided with incorrect login/password I expect it to generate:\njavax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException: 535 5.7.8 Error: authentication failed: authentication failure\n\nIf this happens the sample is currently automatically marked as failed, even though to my test if was correct.", "id": 144356, "time": "2011-02-16T10:52:02Z", "bug_id": 50797, "creation_time": "2011-02-16T10:52:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "You can use the \"Ignore status\" checkbox of the Response Assertion to reset the status.\n\nDoes that not work for you?", "id": 145248, "time": "2011-03-24T23:18:44Z", "bug_id": 50797, "creation_time": "2011-03-24T23:18:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Just add a Response Assertion and set Ignore Status checkbox", "is_private": false, "id": 149348, "creation_time": "2011-09-17T00:28:21Z", "time": "2011-09-17T00:28:21Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "bug_id": 50797, "attachment_id": null}]
