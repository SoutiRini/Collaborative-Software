It would be easier to debug the problem for the user if the\nexception that they sent me showed the port number that the server was\ntrying to bind to at the time of the exception. That way, I can tell if it\nwas the shutdown port or the running port.\n\nThis is a little patch that should improve BindException error reporting. It\nis against the 4.0.x branch. I'm not sure that I did it 100% right so I'm\nsubmitting here in the hopes that someone (Craig? Remy?) will either \napprove\nit or fix it and apply it. When you see it, I think that you will get what\nI'm trying to do. Also, I'm not sure if this patch covers the shutdown port\n#...if it doesn't that would be another good place to apply it to as well.\n\nThanks,\n\n-jon", "id": 10079, "time": "2002-01-30T17:56:18Z", "bug_id": 6130, "creation_time": "2002-01-30T17:56:18Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jon@latchkey.com", "text": "Created attachment 1096\nsample patch for this issue.", "id": 10080, "attachment_id": 1096, "bug_id": 6130, "creation_time": "2002-01-30T17:56:56Z", "time": "2002-01-30T17:56:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jon@latchkey.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "setting priority and severity", "id": 10081, "time": "2002-01-30T17:57:27Z", "bug_id": 6130, "creation_time": "2002-01-30T17:57:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6130, "text": "Fixed in nightly build 20020201.", "id": 10135, "time": "2002-01-31T20:56:21Z", "creator": "craig.mcclanahan@sun.com", "creation_time": "2002-01-31T20:56:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "jon@latchkey.com", "text": "thanks craig!", "id": 10139, "time": "2002-01-31T21:43:48Z", "bug_id": 6130, "creation_time": "2002-01-31T21:43:48Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
