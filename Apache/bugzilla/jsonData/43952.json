The central border is set on the column of\nthe /inner/ table which has no forced mininum height; so it grows up to its\nnatural height which appears to be less than 2.5em. Try and put borders on the\ninner table to see where it ends.\nTo achieve what you need you must put the minimal height on the row of the inner\ntable.\n\nHTH,\nVincent", "id": 111105, "time": "2007-11-26T08:38:17Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-11-26T08:38:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43952, "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs", "id": 156976, "time": "2012-04-01T13:55:49Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:55:49Z", "is_private": false}]
