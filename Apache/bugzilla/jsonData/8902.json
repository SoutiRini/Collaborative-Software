I filled the \nform ok and then click Commit, nothing happen but go back the user login form\n(http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/post_bug.cgi).\nI tested in Win32, maybe others have it too.\n1.3.20 has no this problem. \nMaybe things come from mod_proxy HTTP/1.1 support. I bet the mod_proxy doesn't \nsend the browse the right cookies or heads, in this site my browse never gets \nthe cookies when i login. Sure.\nThanks!
