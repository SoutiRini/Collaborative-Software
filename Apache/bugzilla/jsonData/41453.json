Browser (IE) simply hangs at that time and \ncontinously keeps on rotating and ultimately after a long search it gives \nthe \"page cannot be displayed\" error.I cann't figure out which particular \nactivity is making Apache to hang.\n\nThis happens usually 2 to 3 times everyday. But sometimes entire day passes \nwithout this also. \n\nThis problem is pending for the last 3 months. I have tried everyting being it \nbe changes in the configuration of Apache or detecting if there is some port \nconflict with Apache (80 or 443). But could not come up with any solution.I \nstudied all the logs (Apache error.log , mod_jk.log) but could not sort out \nanything from that.\n\nAlso one another thing, some of internal users connect directly to Apache.\nWhile some internet users connect through \"Proxy (Squid)\"  which further simply \nforward it to the production server on port 80 where Apache(Http) is listening.\n\n\n\nPlease if anybody can tell me the solution that would be appreciated.\n\n\nRegards\nSatinder", "id": 98463, "time": "2007-01-24T10:23:08Z", "creator": "ssaini_14@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2007-01-24T10:23:08Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41453, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm having the same problem. \n\nMy apache is 2.2, wind S.O. 2003 SP2. \n\nI can not find evidence of what's going on. \n\nSo I would be grateful if someone help me on solving this problem that is becoming critical.\n\nAtt.,\n\nOya Mawu", "id": 130121, "time": "2009-09-02T11:22:11Z", "creator": "oyamawu@yahoo.com.br", "creation_time": "2009-09-02T11:22:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41453, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.\n\nMore specifically, 1.3 is no longer maintained for the win32 port.\n\nFor the 2.2 port, there is no information in this report to indicate the \nnature of any code defect.
