If this\nproperty is not set, this methoid should not fail. Instead it should fall back\nto the standard Xerces parser, probably org.xml.parsers.SAXParser.\n\nThis is in accordance with the SAX documentaiton for this class\n(http://sax.sourceforge.net/apidoc/org/xml/sax/helpers/XMLReaderFactory.html)\nwhich states:\n\nNote to Distributions bundled with parsers:  You should modify the\nimplementation of the no-arguments createXMLReader to handle cases where the\nexternal configuration mechanisms aren't set up. That method should do its best\nto return a parser when one is in the class path, even when nothing bound its\nclass name to org.xml.sax.driver so those configuration mechanisms would see it."}]
