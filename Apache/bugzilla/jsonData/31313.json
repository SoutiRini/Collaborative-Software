I \nwent ahead and changed it to be an absoluate URI pointing to the schema document location. \n\nNote that there is a space character between the namespace declaration and schema document \nlocation. That space character is intentional.\n\nI know that some IDE's may have problems with the new W3C standards. Hopefully they will be catching \nup and supporting these types of definitions soon."}]
