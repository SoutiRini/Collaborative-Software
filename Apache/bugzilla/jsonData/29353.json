I decided to upgrade to 2.0.49 and PHP5 RC2. So I uninstall 2.0.48 and \nPHP5 RC1 and installed the recent version of both. The only edit's i've made \nto the config is the DocumentRoot, and the port number, and loading PHP5 as a \nSAPI module, and approprietly giving the right document extensions for it. I \nstart it up, open my *.htm file and its missing the first 97 or so lines of \nthe file. I figured maybe it was my error, and proceeded to upload the file to \na remote server. It wasn't.\n\nIt apparently only happens with *.htm files. I have tried .txt files and no \nresults. and Images do not show up. I tried downgrading to 2.0.48 (after \nuninstalling 2.0.49 and PHP5 RC2) without loading up PHP5RC2 into the \nhttpd.conf and just changed the directory as per normal. Same effect. After \nmany hours of frustration over this I took to IRC and tried troubleshooting, \nNobody could understand it.\n\nMy initial file I was using in .htm was 6495 Characters long, and 160 lines \nlong. I decided to test by putting 6k random characters into a file, And most \nof it was cut short. I moved to 5k, same effect. At 2k is when it didn't do it \nanymore. I also left the default dev port (8080) and nothing changed.\n\nI am running Windows XP 5.1 SP1 2600\nPentium 4 2.53GHZ\n2 sticks of PC2700 512MB DDR Ram\n\nProcesses list (using PSList):\nName                             Pid Pri Thd  Hnd      VM      WS    Priv\nIdle                               0   0   1    0       0      20       0\n  System                           4   8  62  394    1840     228       0\n    smss                         484  11   3   21    3760     464     172\n      csrss                      540  13  13  771   27204    4752    1972\n      winlogon                   568  13  19  580   51352    4948    7340\n        services                 612   9  16  320   21620    3312    1600\n          svchost                824   8   9  278   18520    3548    1272\n          svchost                876   8  77 1318  108568   19624   13236\n          svchost               1060   8   5   64   13512    2116     792\n          svchost               1088   8  15  138   28236    3768    1288\n          spoolsv               1216   8  10  117   25368    4220    2732\n          avgserv               1348   8   4   46   12376    1680     548\n          CDAC11BA              1400   8   4   31   18232    1332     440\n          CTSVCCDA              1424   8   2   29   16188    1444     472\n          AvpM                  1456   8   2   36   26552    2552    1744\n          Navapsvc              1488   8   9  111   29880    4204    3540\n          nvsvc32               1520   8   3   70   20068    2620     672\n          vsmon                 1656   8  16  435   58688   10268   10296\n          MsPMSPSv              1692   8   2   44   13952    1612     476\n          Apache                2696   8   3   55   24100    3952    1456\n            Apache              2292   8 252  296   87788    7564    6512\n        lsass                    624   9  21  327   38280    1284    3420\n        wbload                  1592   8   1   42   39044    4152    4528\n        explorer                3760   8  21  628  115632   21928   22120\n          iexplore               372   8   6  395   97316   16108   13844\n          cmd                   1188   8   1   20   15644    1720    1656\n            pslist              2388  13   2   83   19628    1988     972\n          msnmsgr               2720   8  10  421   89276    5844   24928\n          ApacheMonitor         2872   8   1   63   37948    7040    3696\nNavapw32                         184   8   8  205   60968   10704    6384\ntcm                              188   8   1   45   38268    7604    4400\navgcc32                          224   8   1   99   43124    8248    5252\nkbd                              236  13  13  241   80868    9832    5744\nCTHELPER                         252   8   3   83   43080    7736    4748\nrealsched                        356   8   3   52   38812     172    3636\nrundll32                         388   8   1   42   37272    6060    5300\nwinampa                          404   8   1   39   36420    5592    4160\nwinamp                           732   8  11  273  101540   12072   27792\nrundll32                        1056   8   4   94   39992    8324    5060\nzlclient                        1584   8   6  124   52904    7156    7700\nmirc                            2532   8   9  428  223284   15580   17084\n  iexplore                      2032   8  11  377   97848   23488   12156\n  iexplore                      3948   8  11  535  103184   19504   14332\nwircd                           2768   8   2   74   46688    5080    8792\n\nIf It is something is at my fault I apologize for posting this but i'm dying \nto know.", "id": 58596, "time": "2004-06-03T07:43:03Z", "creator": "MageOfChrisz@Hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-03T07:43:03Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "attachment_id": null, "id": 58599, "time": "2004-06-03T08:47:27Z", "bug_id": 29353, "creation_time": "2004-06-03T08:47:27Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Could you try one of the following directives (single and/or combination) and\nsee if it helps:\n\nWin32DisableAcceptEx\nEnableSendfile Off\nEnableMMap Off\n\nThanks."}, {"count": 2, "text": "Okay, this is getting a little weirder.
