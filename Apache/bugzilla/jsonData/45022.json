So with a line like this:\n\nInclude /usr/local/apache/conf/domains/\\*.somedomain.com/*.enabled\n\nThe *.enabled glob is handled correctly, but the escaped \\*.somedomain.com isn't.\n\napr_fnmatch_test() correctly determines that it's not a wildcard because of the escape character.\n\nap_is_directory() fails because the backslash isn't removed before the stat().\n\nThe escape characters need to be removed from the path between those two tests."}]
