[{"count": 0, "text": "Hi!\n\nI would love if the online documentation (http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/functions.html) would mention in which version the functions were introduced. \n\nReason: I was looking up the \"RandomString\" function online today, wrote a TC using it, and wondered why it didn't work ... I looked up in the function helper and found the function missing there. Only then I thought that there may have been a new version released (btw: is there some JMeter blog or whatever that propagates new releases through RSS?) and that the new function had been introduced there. If the documentation would have mentioned \"Since: JMeter 2.6\" it would have been a much less painful path ;)\n\nExample where this is already quite common: Javadoc (eg. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html mentions \"Since: JDK1.0\")\n\nOf course this would not have to be done to cover previous versions, so eg. older functions would just read or \"Since: before JMeter 2.6\" (as for 2.6 it still is feasible to point these changes out)\n\nthanks for considering :)\n\nbr,\nImm", "bug_id": 52680, "attachment_id": null, "id": 153831, "time": "2012-02-16T09:58:07Z", "creator": "immanuel.hayden@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-02-16T09:58:07Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Date: Fri Feb 17 20:19:18 2012\nNew Revision: 1245739\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1245739&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 52680 - Mention version in which function was introduced\n\nModified:\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/BeanShell.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/CSVRead.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/CharFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/EscapeHtml.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/EvalFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/EvalVarFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/FileToString.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/IntSum.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/IterationCounter.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/JavaScript.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/Jexl2Function.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/JexlFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/LogFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/LogFunction2.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/LongSum.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/MachineIP.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/MachineName.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/Property.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/Property2.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/Random.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/RandomString.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/RegexFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/SamplerName.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/SetProperty.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/SplitFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/StringFromFile.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/TestPlanName.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/ThreadNumber.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/TimeFunction.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/UnEscape.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/UnEscapeHtml.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/Variable.java\n   jmeter/trunk/src/functions/org/apache/jmeter/functions/XPath.java\n   jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n   jmeter/trunk/xdocs/usermanual/functions.xml", "bug_id": 52680, "attachment_id": null, "id": 153892, "time": "2012-02-17T20:20:14Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-02-17T20:20:14Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
