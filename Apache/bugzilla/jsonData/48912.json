These classes have been in the extras companions for several years where they can be used with any version of log4j 1.2 at least back to 1.2.8 or .9.\n\nWhile this location is convenient for those who are unable to upgrade to more recent log4j versions, they are easy to overlook.  Making these class available in the core log4j.jar will benefit those users who prefer to update their log4j.jar instead of adding a new dependency.  Since these classes are not instantiated, there should hopefully be no issues if the classes are present in multiple jars.", "id": 135339, "time": "2010-03-15T05:20:12Z", "bug_id": 48912, "creation_time": "2010-03-15T05:20:12Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48912, "text": "Committed rev 923058.", "id": 135340, "time": "2010-03-15T05:25:40Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-03-15T05:25:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
