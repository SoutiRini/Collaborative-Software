[{"count": 0, "text": "Update of junit-frames.xsl to get separate lists of failures and errors.\n\nI created a patch for junit-frames.xsl (against CVS HEAD) that adds\nspecial pages for failures only (and errors only). These special pages\nare report-wide and class-specific. You can always get to this page by\nclicking on the number of errors or failures. Report-wide flat list of\ntests has been added too.\n\nThis whole change is tested.\n\nPlease review it and commit it if you want.\n\nNote: already sent to mailing list, see:\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ant-dev/200508.mbox/%3c1123764142.7021.18.camel@localhost.localdomain%3e", "bug_id": 36226, "is_private": false, "id": 78583, "time": "2005-08-17T16:02:20Z", "creator": "jan.mynarik@systinet.com", "creation_time": "2005-08-17T16:02:20Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 16082, "bug_id": 36226, "is_private": false, "id": 78584, "time": "2005-08-17T16:04:02Z", "creator": "jan.mynarik@systinet.com", "creation_time": "2005-08-17T16:04:02Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 16082\nPatch adding special pages for errors and failures only\n\nThe actual patch."}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "stevel@apache.org", "text": "changes applied to CVS_HEAD, thank you!\n\nincidentally, it would be nice to have the overview page link to these two pages...", "id": 78625, "time": "2005-08-18T14:33:02Z", "bug_id": 36226, "creation_time": "2005-08-18T14:33:02Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36226, "text": "Actually, links are there.
