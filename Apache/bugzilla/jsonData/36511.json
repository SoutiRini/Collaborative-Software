The document lays out\neight circles and one text in a grid formation.  Clicking the black rect will\nincrease the radius of the first circle by 10 units and relayout the grid. \nAfter six or seven clicks on the black rect, the rendering problem occurs.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Load http://mcc.id.au/temp/2005/grid3.svg.\n   (http://mcc.id.au/temp/2005/s1.png)\n2. Click the black rect a few times.\n   (http://mcc.id.au/temp/2005/s2.png)\n3. Click the black rect a few more times.  Notice the duplication of part of\n   the purple circle and the text.\n   (http://mcc.id.au/temp/2005/s3.png)\n\nThis bug occurs with Batik 1.6 (and the trunk) but not with 1.5.1. \nUnfortunately I'm not familiar with the rendering part of the code so I'm not\nsure where to start looking."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36511, "text": "This should be fixed in SVN now.\n", "id": 79974, "time": "2005-09-15T03:54:08Z", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-09-15T03:54:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
