I tried to fix this problem by setting -XX \nMaxPermSize\nbut jvm is not setting it.\nThe environment I am using :\n\nTomcat 5.0.30\nJdk 1.5\nWindows XP\n\nI am seeting in service.bat like this :\nset CATALINA_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=256m\n\"%EXECUTABLE%\" //US//%SERVICE_NAME% ++JvmOptions \"-Djava.io.tmpdir=%\nCATALINA_BASE%\\temp;-Dcatalina.opts=%CATALINA_OPTS%\" --JvmMs 512 --JvmMx 512\n\nI am creating a  service and then starting it.\nI have a JSP which shows the Heap/Non-Heap memory allocations including \nPermGen memory.\nWhen I load this page its showing the correct values (the values I am setting) \nfor Xmx Xms but for PermGen its showing the default values and not the value I \nam setting. For some reason JVM is not taking the -XX:MaxPermSize. \nBut if I set these in catalina.bat like  this\nset CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\nand run startup.bat JVM is setting all these parameters correctly.\n\nAny help would be greatly appericiated.\n\nThank You,\nAparna", "id": 84765, "time": "2006-01-19T06:57:14Z", "bug_id": 38317, "creation_time": "2006-01-19T06:57:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38317, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 38315 ***", "id": 84771, "time": "2006-01-19T12:15:32Z", "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "creation_time": "2006-01-19T12:15:32Z", "is_private": false}]
