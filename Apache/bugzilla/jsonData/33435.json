When the browser (IE in this case) sends this parameter\nto the server it is URL encoded (confirmed via a network protocol monitor)\nhowever if the session is recorded via the Jmeter proxy, the parameter value is\nnot URL encoded when displayed in the HTTP Request element.  Even though the\nEncode option is checked, Jmeter delivers the parameter to the application\nun-encoded ( also confirmed via a network protocol monitor).  The asp.net\napplication then throws a corrupted state exception.\n\nThis seems to only be a problem for http-upload transactions as POST operations\nrecoded earlier in the script have the __VIEWSTATE parameter correctly encoded\nin the HTTP Request element and deliver the parameter encoded to the application.", "id": 70591, "time": "2005-02-07T23:17:51Z", "creator": "eric.shoemaker@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-02-07T23:17:51Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33435, "is_private": false, "id": 101868, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "alf@i100.no", "creation_time": "2007-04-18T05:29:48Z", "time": "2007-04-18T05:29:48Z", "text": "I think this bug should be closed as \"Fixed\".\n\nAs the bug states, the problem appeared in file upload, i.e. multipart/form-data\nHTTP Post requests.\nIn bug 41837 a problem in HTTP Proxy server's handling of multipart/form-data\nwas fixed. The problem was that the code incorrectly assumed that values of a\nmultipart/form-data was urlencoded, which it is not.\n\nI have testet the latest code in SVN, and the values of __VIEWSTATE is sent\ncorrectly by the proxy, and by the sampler put into the test plan.\n\nSo this is really a duplicate of 41837."}]
