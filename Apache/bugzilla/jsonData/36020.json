Anyone\nwho could do es/fr/ja ?\n\nI think, at the moment there is no documentation for Userdatabase, so no place\nto add \"readonly\" information. If I'm wrong, please correct me.\n\nI'll try to add the readonly info to admin too (later).\n\nLast question: the close() for the MemoryUserDatabase is never called,\nespecially not during shutdown of tomcat. Anyone with a good hint, where to look\nfor adding a hook to close MemoryUserDatabase during tomcat shutdown?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "attachment_id": 15885, "is_private": false, "id": 78087, "time": "2005-08-04T11:40:38Z", "bug_id": 36020, "creation_time": "2005-08-04T11:40:38Z", "text": "Created attachment 15885\nreadonly MemoryUserDatabase and warning instead of exception"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36020, "attachment_id": null, "id": 78116, "time": "2005-08-04T15:14:28Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-08-04T15:14:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I applied the patch, but I changed \"persistable\" -> \"writeable\".
