This ensures that users are forced to \nspecify the location of their builds and be aware of the need for Cocoon and Tomcat installations.\n\nNote that, in keeping with previous discussions it would be good to make the build default to Cocoon's \njetty installation, but I should get my build running first!", "id": 56669, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "stuart.roebuck@adolos.co.uk", "creation_time": "2004-04-29T23:12:59Z", "time": "2004-04-29T23:12:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 11388\nThree patch files zipped as one.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 28701, "id": 56670, "time": "2004-04-29T23:14:10Z", "creator": "stuart.roebuck@adolos.co.uk", "creation_time": "2004-04-29T23:14:10Z", "attachment_id": 11388}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28701, "text": "Added lenya-dev@cocoon.apache.org to CC-list.", "id": 56718, "time": "2004-05-02T07:59:39Z", "creator": "A.Kuckartz@ping.de", "creation_time": "2004-05-02T07:59:39Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "A.Kuckartz@ping.de", "is_private": false, "id": 56800, "time": "2004-05-04T13:56:43Z", "bug_id": 28701, "creation_time": "2004-05-04T13:56:43Z", "tags": [], "text": "Maybe those patches can or should be applied to 1.2 ?!"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28701, "text": "too intrusive for 1.2", "count": 4, "id": 57507, "time": "2004-05-16T11:32:02Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-05-16T11:32:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28701, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Maybe this patch can or should be applied to 1.2.1 ?", "id": 65462, "time": "2004-10-21T18:31:15Z", "creator": "A.Kuckartz@ping.de", "creation_time": "2004-10-21T18:31:15Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28701, "is_private": false, "text": "Ok, the question here is if this goes into 1.4 or 1.2.1 -> Please discuss", "id": 65589, "time": "2004-10-23T12:19:51Z", "creator": "roku@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-10-23T12:19:51Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28701, "is_private": false, "count": 7, "id": 65629, "time": "2004-10-25T04:57:50Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-10-25T04:57:50Z", "text": "this has mostly been achieved with the build refactoring as of today. feel free\nto send a new patch if you think something is missing. closing for now."}]
