This can be troublesome as the exact\noutput may be hard to predict without explicitly setting the default locale\n(which is not possible in many environments).\n\nIt would be great if it was possible to specify the locale that you want to\nbe used when formatting numbers and dates. See the attached patch for a proposed\nway to do this.\n\nFor more background, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-371.", "id": 133925, "time": "2010-01-26T01:56:21Z", "bug_id": 48617, "creation_time": "2010-01-26T01:56:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 24887}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48617, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks.
