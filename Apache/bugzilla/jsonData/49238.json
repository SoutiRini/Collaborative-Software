All was fine until the problem cropped up when the Report generation in Production crossed the 65k+ limit set by Excel 2003. Since anyway we open the reports in Excel 2007, my immediate instinct was to change the filename of my report from .xls to .xlsx. Obviously this didn't work since I was using POI 2.5.1.\n\nThen I downloaded the latest POI 3.6 and tried to open the generated .xlsx file. Even now I get the same error as I used to get with POI 2.5.1 as follows:\n\"Excel cannot open the file '<filename.xlsx>' because the file format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file.\"\n\nMoment I revert the file extension to .xls, it allows me to open the file. But it still cannot support more than 65k+ records. \n\nBased on 3.6' documentaton I have compiled my sources in JDK 1.5. Please let me know your thoughts.\n\nRegards,\nRaghu"}, {"text": "Please see http://poi.apache.org/spreadsheet/converting.html for information about how to convert from using HSSF to the SS model so that you can support both xls and xlsx from your program.\n\nJoin the poi-user list and ask any questions there.\n\nThanks,\nDave", "tags": [], "bug_id": 49238, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 136576, "time": "2010-04-30T18:18:35Z", "creator": "dfisher@jmlafferty.com", "creation_time": "2010-04-30T18:18:35Z", "attachment_id": null}]
