It is not reproducible on NT, though.\r\nI've checked the \"tomcat.bat\" file and isolated the problem to the following block:\r\n\r\nset CLASSPATH=.\r\nset CLASSPATH=%TOMCAT_HOME%\\classes\r\nset CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%TOMCAT_HOME%\\lib\\webserver.jar\r\nset CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%TOMCAT_HOME%\\lib\\jasper.jar\r\nset CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%TOMCAT_HOME%\\lib\\xml.jar\r\nset CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%TOMCAT_HOME%\\lib\\servlet.jar\r\nset CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\\lib\\tools.jar\r\n\r\nWhen it is executed, the second-to-last line was totally ignored. I assume there is a limit of # of characters to put in CLASSPATH settings for Win95/98.\r\nIf I put everything in a single line, all were ignored.\r\nLook at the second line, wouldn't it be:\r\nset CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%TOMCAT_HOME%\\class ? Otherwise you lose logic to put in the first line.\r\nHowever, if I do so, the last two lines will be ignored.\r\nIf I use a Command Prompt and manually enter the above lines, they will be accepted, but it seems to have done no good to the Tomcat environment.\r\n", "id": 104, "time": "2000-09-18T14:27:08Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2000-09-18T14:27:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 124, "is_private": false, "id": 539, "time": "2001-02-03T18:09:42Z", "creator": "craig.mcclanahan@sun.com", "creation_time": "2001-02-03T18:09:42Z", "tags": [], "text": "Solved on Tomcat versions 3.2 and up ."}]
