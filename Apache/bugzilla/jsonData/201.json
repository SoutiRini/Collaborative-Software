We have several JSP's being used in a single web session and we use a Java Bean with session scope using the <jsp:useBean...> tag. The problem is that the http session gets invalidated between JSP requests for some unknown reason and the Java Bean is lost. Any reference to the bean raises a null pointer exception.\r\n\r\nHow can I prevent the http session from being invalidated so frequently? it happens to 1 out of 6 requests. Is this a bug in TOMCAT? how do I work around this?\r\n\r\nThanks.", "id": 179, "time": "2000-10-26T08:36:32Z", "bug_id": 201, "creation_time": "2000-10-26T08:36:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 201, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 2218, "time": "2001-05-02T21:23:57Z", "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "creation_time": "2001-05-02T21:23:57Z", "text": "I have test cases with jsp:useBeans stored in session scope working in\nTomcat 3.2.x and Tomcat 3.3.
