Such characters have been\ndefined in Unicode 3.1, and I just used my first one, and XMLSerializer promptly\nbroke.\n\nHowever when a text node containing such a character is output in the ISO-8859-1\nencoding using XMLSerializer, such a chaarcter is omitted as two entity\nreferneces, one for each half of the corresponding surrogate pair, rather than a\nsingle entity reference. That is what should be &#x1D122; instead becomes\n&#xd834;&#xdd22; This is malformed. These characters are not allowed in XML\ndocuments. \n\nFor the moment, a work-around is to use UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1. Then no\nentity references at all are generated and the output is well-formed."}]
