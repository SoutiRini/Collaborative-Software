See https://icing.github.io/mod_h2/\n\nVery cool, from the HTML is it fair to say it's mod_spdy like (separate threads from the MPM, virtual conn_recs?).  One of the takeaways from mod_spdy was that some of this is better/easier with changes to the core rather than gymnastics in a module.  Please let us know if you hit anything like this where simple API's would make life easier."}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57624, "is_private": false, "text": "Hi Eric,\n\nyes, it's heavily based on mod_spdy work. The goal is to have it first working and deployable in a 2.4 httpd.
