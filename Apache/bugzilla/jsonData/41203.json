Each domain has two workers domain_01,domain_02 up to the ninth domain (18 \nworkers) everything goes fine. On each one I do a reference tag for some standard variables. When I \nadd the worker number 19 on the 10th domain i get this on the Apache error log:\n\n[Mon Dec 18 11:40:50 2006] [notice] suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: /usr/sbin/suexec)\n[Mon Dec 18 11:40:50 2006] [emerg] Error in resolving configuration references\n\nIf I commented it it works again.
