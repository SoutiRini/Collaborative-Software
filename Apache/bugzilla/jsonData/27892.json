Now think about fileset ...\n\nBut using <script> you can do what you want. Last year I posted a solution on \nhttp://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ant-user&m=105393627611631&w=2. With Ant 1.6 \nand its <scriptdef> I would change that a little bit (the old solution needs a \nspecial named fileset, with scriptdef you can use a nested one)."}]
