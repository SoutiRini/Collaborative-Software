When using the indexing to display\nfiles, if I click on a JPG file, with mozilla 0.99 or netscape 4.76 it comes\nacross as text.  However if I rename the same file to end with jpg, it then\nworks fine.  I checked my mime.types file and it looks ok, I even added JPG to\nthe appropriate line, although it shouldnt mantter and it didnt help.  I also\nturned off mime_magic in case that was causing the problem.  We then created a\nfile a.JPG and a.jpg with just a few letters of text and did the following:\n\nfor a.jpg\ntelnet arthur 80\nGET /a.jpg HTTP/1.0\nBla bla bla\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\nfile contents\n\nfor a.JPG\ntelnet arthur 80\nGET /a.JPG HTTP/1.0\nBla Bla Bla\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\nfile contents\n\nIs this my mistake (if so where) or apache's\n\nthanks,\n\nDan", "id": 14862, "time": "2002-04-26T19:19:00Z", "creator": "danield@life.uiuc.edu", "creation_time": "2002-04-26T19:19:00Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8567, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed in next release.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 8223 ***", "id": 14863, "time": "2002-04-26T19:22:46Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-26T19:22:46Z", "is_private": false}]
