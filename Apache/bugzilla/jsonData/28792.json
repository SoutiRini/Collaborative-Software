Files above 100 KB always loaded incompletely or not at all.\n\nI viewed the http headers Internet Explorer was sending using a proxy server \n(Proximotron) and it indicated that Internet Explorer was requesting the files \nthe first time I went to the web page, but then requesting only upper ranges of \nbytes in the files each time I refreshed after that (as if it knew it already \nhad part of the file and was requesting the rest).\n\nApache isn't reporting any errors in the error logs and the access log reports \nthe \"GET\" with okay status \"200\" and says the correct full file size.\n\nI tried the same thing on a different computer running Windows 2000, and it \nworked fine.\n\nThe images and html files can be loaded by Internet Explorer normally when I \naccess them directly through the file system.
