I noticed that not all\nthe samplers were being invoked, and in the jmeter.log I can see the\nfollowing line:\n\n2017/01/30 13:41:54 INFO  - jmeter.threads.JMeterThread: Stopping because\nend time detected by thread: Sports 1-1\n\nDoes this mean that the Validate feature is still subject to Scheduler\nduration? Currently, I use the following:\n\nThreads = ${__P(user.sports.usercount,0)}\nDuration (Scheduler enabled) = ${__P(user.sports.duration)}\n\nBoth parameter options are not specified, i.e. they will take default\nvalues of 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nI suspect that since I haven't explicitly set a second default-value\nparameter to __P() function for the Duration setting, it's setting it to 1\nas per the __P() docs, but I was expecting Validate would ignore\nduration/endtime setting as it does for Threads.\n\nAs an aside, I do have a patch ready for this, which is adding the line\n                tg.setScheduler(false);\nto TreeClonerForValidation.java\n\nThanks", "id": 196675, "time": "2017-02-02T20:23:58Z", "bug_id": 60684, "creation_time": "2017-02-02T20:23:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60684, "text": "Author: pmouawad\nDate: Thu Feb  2 20:29:40 2017\nNew Revision: 1781467\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1781467&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 60684 - Thread Group: Validate ended prematurely by Scheduler with 0 or very short duration\nContributed by Andrew Burton\nBugzilla Id: 60684\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/validation/TreeClonerForValidation.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 196676, "time": "2017-02-02T20:30:03Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2017-02-02T20:30:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
