Should they be, then it is your responsibility to validate what is generated in order to avoid mis-behavior or security related problems.\n\n\n(In reply to Mahmoud El Manzalawy from comment #9)\n> you mean in this site or in ather site ?\nSo, to answer this, I would say that there is no need to report it anywhere.
