Ignoring the client's preferences is a two-part thing. You must SuppressColumnSorting to remove the sort link at the top of the column, and also IgnoreClient to prevent them just putting the sort arguments directly in the query string.\n\nHowever, I think that this paragraph is just phrased wrong. This directive is for setting a *default* sort order. The decision to not let the client reorder is a separate thing, and we shouldn't imply that it's necessary in order to set a default ordering.
