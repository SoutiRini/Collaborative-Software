We started JMeter sometime between 16:30 and 16:45. At \naround 17:45 the test began to shut down. From this behaviour my assumption is \nthat the duration value commences couting down when JMeter is started not when \nthe actual test is started. \nIn an extreme example a test executed a single sampler and then stopped as the \nduration had elapsed before the start time was reached. \nThis sounds like a bug to me but the documentation is not clear in regard to \nexactly how the duration value is interpreted. Can someone tell me if this is \nthe desired behaviour or not so we can adjust our testing appropriately.\n\nThanks\n\nAndrew"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31596, "text": "Fixed in CVS 2.0 ", "id": 64900, "time": "2004-10-11T00:19:11Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-10-11T00:19:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Sebb,\n\nWe're using the nightly release 20040923 and its not fixed in that.
