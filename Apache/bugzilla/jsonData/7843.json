It is meant merely as an example, not as a way to\nconfigure SSL out of the box.  Therefore, substitutions for your layout are not\n what we wish to do.\n\nThis was a conscious decision on our part.  If you wish us to revisit this,\nplease post to dev@httpd.apache.org with your rationale as this is a development\nissue not a bug.\n\nFWIW, the proper fix would be to rename ssl-std.conf as ssl-std.conf.in and\nsubject it to the same substitutions as httpd-std.conf.\n\nThanks for using Apache!"}]
