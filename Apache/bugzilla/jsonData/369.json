[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "While Tomcat's JSP engine handles oddly named files very well, the builtin webserver does a poor job of creating properly formatted URLs for those files. \r\n\r\nFor example, a JSP with filename \"odd file name.jsp\" should be accessed by the relative URL \"/path/odd%20file%20name.jsp\". Unfortunately, when the webserver's directory indexer generates relative URLs like this, \"/path/odd file name.jsp\", so that when the user follows this link, a 404 error page is returned:\r\n\r\nNot found (404)\r\nOriginal request: /path/odd\r\nNot found request: /paths/odd\r\n\r\nAlso, if it's an oddly named resource (html file), then the webserver can't handle the correct URL, either. (For example, for \"odd file.html\", the directory indexer will generate a link like \"/path/odd file.html\", which doesn't work, so I type \"http://server/path/odd%20file.html\" into the location, and I get a 404:\r\n\r\nNot found (404)\r\nOriginal request: /path/odd%20file.html\r\nNot found request: /path/odd%20file.html\r\n\r\nClearly, the webserver included in tomcat is not a production webserver, and tomcat is meant to be installed into another webserver, but it is a bug none-the-less. The indexer could probobly be fixed rather easily to generate proper directory indices, and there's a good chance that the resource finder could be patched to handle %-escaped URLs proplerly relatively easily, too.\r\n\r\n", "is_private": false, "id": 344, "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "time": "2000-12-22T13:51:40Z", "bug_id": 369, "creation_time": "2000-12-22T13:51:40Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in 3.2.2", "is_private": false, "id": 1296, "creator": "marc.saegesser@apropos.com", "time": "2001-03-15T11:03:47Z", "bug_id": 369, "creation_time": "2001-03-15T11:03:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "marc.saegesser@apropos.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 1331, "time": "2001-03-16T15:21:42Z", "bug_id": 369, "creation_time": "2001-03-16T15:21:42Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 418 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}]
