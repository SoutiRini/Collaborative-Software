When we use opensource VM\nsuch as gcj,kaffe,JikesRVM, we don't have SUN's javadoc implementation and\ncouldn't use javadoc. gjdoc is good   \nalternative. Here is a large patch for gjdoc support. I refactored Javadoc with\nAdapter Pattern like javac task and rmic task. My pache is here:\n\nhttp://yamaguch.sytes.net/~tora/tmp/ant-gjdoc.patch\n\nCould you support gjdoc?\n\nBTW, gjdoc don't support some of options which is supported SUN's javadoc. If\nyou support gjdoc, I would like to modify javadoc task document.\n\nregards,\n\nTakashi Okamoto"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 44876, "time": "2003-09-30T09:35:28Z", "bug_id": 23441, "creation_time": "2003-09-30T09:35:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "closing on user's request."}]
