For further help, move to the mailing list fop-users@xmlgraphics.apache.org\n\nSecond, I'm quite sure what you defined are fallback fonts. Fop is looking for font SimHei to render the block. If SimHei is not found, Angsa is used. If Angsa isn't found either, SimSun is used. \n\nThird, how exactly should Fop guess which character to display in which language, if you only hand over a set of languages and a string? \n\nFourth, as a solution, you might try to split your multi-language string in different fo:inline objects and set the correct fonts for the inline objects. Then fop may know, which character to display in which font.\n\nHTH.", "id": 125208, "time": "2009-02-27T03:13:20Z", "creator": "gd@geneon.de", "creation_time": "2009-02-27T03:13:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "max@berger.name", "attachment_id": null, "id": 125249, "time": "2009-03-02T04:17:12Z", "bug_id": 46775, "creation_time": "2009-03-02T04:17:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please retest with a recent fop version.
