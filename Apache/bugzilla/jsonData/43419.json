I also wrote this up on Apache Users\non 9/11 and following.]\n\nIn a nutshell, PHP 5.2.(3|4) built against Apache 2.2.6, but not 2.2.4, results\nin Apache serving 302 (redirect) rather than the page content to every page\nrequest, PHP or not, on a current Gentoo x86 system:\n\nPHP         Built Against    Run With    Result\n\n5.2.3       Apache 2.2.4     2.2.4       works\n5.2.3       Apache 2.2.4     2.2.6       works\n5.2.3       Apache 2.2.6     2.2.6       302\n5.2.4       Apache 2.2.4     2.2.4       works\n5.2.4       Apache 2.2.4     2.2.6       works\n5.2.4       Apache 2.2.6     2.2.6       302\n\nSo there appears to be something about what PHP 5.2.(3|4) includes from\nApache 2.2.6, but not Apache 2.2.4, that results in a PHP module which\ncauses Apache to serve 302s rather than pages to every request. The only reply I\ngot on Apache Users says this does not show up on Solaris.\n\nThe build flags used in each case are:\n\nHTTPD\n./configure --enable-so --enable-ssl --enable-rewrite\nPHP\n./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --with-mysql --disable-cgi\n\nThere are no errors showing in starting Apache or in the logs. But pages get\nserved empty, and the logs show \"302\" as the response rather than \"200.\"\nCurrently I have a PHP 5.2.4 module that was built against Apache 2.2.4 running\nwith Apache 2.2.6 without any error. But if I load the PHP 5.2.4 module as it\nbuilds against Apache 2.2.6 with Apache 2.2.6, only 302's are served. Could this\nresult from an API bug, or a change that PHP hasn't kept up with, or ...?", "id": 108338, "time": "2007-09-18T07:25:41Z", "creator": "apache@transpect.com", "creation_time": "2007-09-18T07:25:41Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43419, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Are these gentoo ebuilds?
