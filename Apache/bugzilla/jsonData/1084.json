[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 1084, "text": "This bug appeared in 1.3 and is not present in 1.2.3. \n\nI have a DTD which has an element \"img\" with an attribute \"src\". Similar to the\nHTML tag. From a parsed and validated Document containing the img tag, I get the\nroot element from the source document and do the following:\n\nDocument targetDoc = new DocumentImpl();\ntargetDoc.appendChild(targetDoc.importNode(rootNode, true));\n\nIf I serialize the rootNode I see ....<img src=\"figure.gif\"/>....\n\nIf I serialize the targetDoc I see ....<img src=\"\"/>....\n\nI'm not modifying any of the elements or attributes at all. For some VERY\nstrange reason it seems to be stripping the attribute value for src out, however\nall other elements and attributes come out as expected. This only happens when I\nuse 1.3, when I downgrade back to 1.2.3 everything works as expected.", "id": 1558, "time": "2001-03-22T16:00:29Z", "creator": "sapbasis@iname.com", "creation_time": "2001-03-22T16:00:29Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "lehors@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 1559, "time": "2001-03-22T19:07:46Z", "bug_id": 1084, "creation_time": "2001-03-22T19:07:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is already fixed in 1.3.1."}]
