The cleanup code that runs after you submit just removes it, I believe. Center justify is most likely done with the center tag, which also is not supported in XHTML. Instead of removing, it appears to blow up. You can use styles to support both of these features. The problem is making it work on save and on load into Kupu. You could also hack the validating rng to support those options.\n\nThe compatibility issue probably will never be fixed. Getting two different editors to play nicely on the same content is quite difficult. The suggestion is to pick one editor and stick with it. If you need to support multiple editors for different users, make sure there is no overlap in the pages they edit.", "id": 126658, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "rfrovarp@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-04-30T08:12:49Z", "time": "2009-04-30T08:12:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46934, "attachment_id": null, "id": 138388, "time": "2010-07-13T11:35:18Z", "creator": "rfrovarp@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-07-13T11:35:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thank you for your submission.
