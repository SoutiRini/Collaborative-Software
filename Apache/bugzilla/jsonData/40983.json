Everything was working \nfine till we installed Port80 HTTPZip on the IIS server to do compression. \nOnce that software was installed and compressing the http responses, JMeter \nwould report the error below in the \"Response Data\" window of the results \ntree. HTTPZip is compressing a data stream. Using Fiddler I captured the \nstream and saved it to a file. I was unable to uncompress the file using \nWinRAR. It reported a similar error as JMeter. What I assume is happening is \nthat because the data is streamed there is not a proper file size being \nreported in the compressed file. I am guessing that is why both WinRAR and \nJMeter are unable to uncompress the file. However Internet Explorer is able to \ndisplay the html page just fine. Is there a way to configure/enhance JMeter to \nbe able to deal with this type of compressed data in the same way that \nInternet Explorer does?\n\n\njava.io.EOFException: Unexpected end of ZLIB input stream\n\tat java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream.fill(InflaterInputStream.java:216)\n\tat java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream.read(InflaterInputStream.java:134)\n\tat java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream.read(GZIPInputStream.java:87)\n\tat java.io.BufferedInputStream.fill(BufferedInputStream.java:218)\n\tat java.io.BufferedInputStream.read1(BufferedInputStream.java:256)\n\tat java.io.BufferedInputStream.read(BufferedInputStream.java:313)\n\tat java.io.FilterInputStream.read(FilterInputStream.java:90)\n\tat org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.HTTPSampler.readResponse\n(HTTPSampler.java:243)\n\tat org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.HTTPSampler.sample\n(HTTPSampler.java:433)\n\tat org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.HTTPSamplerBase.sample\n(HTTPSamplerBase.java:658)\n\tat org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.HTTPSamplerBase.sample\n(HTTPSamplerBase.java:647)\n\tat org.apache.jmeter.threads.JMeterThread.run(JMeterThread.java:247)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:595)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "The fact that neither WinRAR nor Java can handle the Zip compression suggests \nthat there is some error in the stream that IE6 is able to ignore.\n\nWhat happens if you try using other browsers such as Opera and FireFox?\n\nThe Zip handling code is part of the Java runtime libraries, not JMeter, so any \nbugs in this area would need to be directed to Sun, though of course one would \nfirst need a simple test case that did not require JMeter.", "id": 95910, "time": "2006-11-16T10:53:15Z", "bug_id": 40983, "creation_time": "2006-11-16T10:53:15Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "Seems to be not a JMeter error", "id": 104996, "time": "2007-07-02T06:06:31Z", "bug_id": 40983, "creation_time": "2007-07-02T06:06:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
