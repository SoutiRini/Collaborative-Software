[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15652, "is_private": false, "text": "We are using Tomcat 3.3.1 with Apache 1.3.27 in Solaris 2.8 ( 4 CPU, 4GB RAM ). \n\n- Under heavy loads, sometimes apache stops processing the requests. At this \ntime, we don't see anything in the access logs. So it is not even accepting the \nrequests.\n- We do NOT have much sockets in TIME_WAIT mode. Its around 400 at peaktime. So \nits not because of these sockets in TIME_WAIT state. We have \ntcp_time_Wait_interval to 60000 which is good enough.\n- We have set the MaxClients to 100 and there are about 70-80 child httpd \nprocess at peak time. Rarely in error_log, we find \"MaxClients reached\". This \nmeans its queueing the requests. But this happens rarely.\n- Is it a bug in 1.3.27. We were using 1.3.20 previously. We did not face this \nproblem before.\n- The problem seems to be there for a while, and apache returns to normal \noperation after 10 or 15 minutes. But for this 10-15 minutes, it is not even \nserving a single request. \n- We don;t see any CPU usage, iowait, kernel usage or other abnormal things \nhappening at this point. \n- Could anyone have a look at it. It would be of great help.\n\nregards\nRajesh.B", "id": 28244, "time": "2002-12-24T14:11:40Z", "creator": "rajeshb@sapient.com", "creation_time": "2002-12-24T14:11:40Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15652, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 15651 ***", "id": 31385, "time": "2003-02-17T01:20:27Z", "creator": "jerenkrantz@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-02-17T01:20:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
