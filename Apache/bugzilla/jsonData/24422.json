[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24422, "text": "I tried 2.0.47 (and updated to 2.0.48) on two separate machines and both suffered from 'hangs' of about 10 minutes followed by BSOD's when closing down. I note that firewalls aren't supported, but wait... On one of the machines I had auto-update turned ON for Zone Alarm and installed the latest patch update. This machine no longer suffered from BSODs and Apache 2.0.48 shuts down cleanly within 5 seconds each time.\n\nI tried this update on a Toshiba Laptop running Windows 2000 and Zone Alarm with the same BSOD problem - I applied the standalone Zone Alarm patch update, rebooted, reinstalled Apache 2.0.48 and this also now cleanly shuts down within 3 or 4 seconds.\n\nThe update version of Zone Alarm (Free) which seems to work OK now is  3.7.211\nEngine version 3.7.211 and driver version 3.7.211. Binary size is 3,669kb.\n\nNo problems at all with Apache so far since the update to Zone Alarm. Both co-habiting nicely. Did not find any relevant notices on the ZoneLabs website though so perhaps they \"fixed\" the problem by accident and someone could mention it so they don't accidentally \"unfix\" it at a later date.", "id": 46838, "time": "2003-11-05T04:01:37Z", "creator": "apachebug@amadis.freeserve.co.uk", "creation_time": "2003-11-05T04:01:37Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24422, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks for the note.\n\nWe aren't going to change our warning about firewalls, because\nthey are very hit-and-miss in general.
