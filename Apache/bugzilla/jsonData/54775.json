Even a trivial build-file leads to this error:\n\n<project name=\"test\" default=\"init\" basedir=\".\">\n\n  <target name=\"init\">\n  </target>\n\n</project>\n\nThe error occured after I installed eclipse and tried to create a eclipse project from a sbt project. For this a had to install maven, and then I followed basically these steps: http://biomunky.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/import-sbt-project-into-eclipse/\n\nI think the maven installation killed something ... but even uninstalling maven and reinstalling ant completely didn't help. I don't know if it is really a ant-bug, but it is at least a very missleading error message. \n\nThanks,\ndaniel", "id": 166251, "time": "2013-03-30T19:45:19Z", "creator": "d_lincke@gmx.de", "creation_time": "2013-03-30T19:45:19Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "I don't have any idea how to help you.
