This is caused by when the class WsFrame of tomcat is entered and the value of int b is set to input buffer, when this is set the value of int rsv (reserve bit) changes to a non 0 number. However b and rsv are never set to each other and thus the changing of b should have no effect on the value of rsv. I believe this may be due to memory corruption or another type of memory error where both values are being held at the same address in memory for some reason."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57318, "text": "The sendbinary method is what causes this error to be thrown not send text or send object.", "id": 179564, "time": "2014-12-05T19:41:18Z", "creator": "jasonricles@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-12-05T19:41:18Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "jasonricles@gmail.com", "text": "This is fixed in at least tomcat 7.0.53 and possibly any version greater then tomcat 7.0.53.", "id": 179565, "time": "2014-12-05T19:48:09Z", "bug_id": 57318, "creation_time": "2014-12-05T19:48:09Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
