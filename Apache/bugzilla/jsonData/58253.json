The goal here was to make the code easier to read and more flexible if POI supports cell references external to the workbook, though I don't know if creating an object is more expensive (time or memory) than a String array. Do we have a good way to test this?\n* Update javadoc for separateRefParts"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58253, "attachment_id": null, "id": 184619, "time": "2015-08-18T14:46:42Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2015-08-18T14:46:42Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks, patch committed in r1696430.\n\n(Even if the string[] is a smidgen faster, readability is important to, so seems worth it)"}]
