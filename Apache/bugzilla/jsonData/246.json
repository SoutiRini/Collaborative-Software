For example, I deployed /tomcat/webapps/bbs application(i.e. bbs repository) and I put test.jnlp(for Java Web Start) into the directory. Although definitely I added some necessary MIME types to /tomcat/conf/web.xml, I couldn't launch my JWS application from bbs app. I tried to put a new web.xml which also contained jnlp mime type into /tomcat/webapps/bbs/WEB-INF, but the result was the same. So I tested the launcher html and jnlp into /tomcat/webapps/ROOT and I found it worked well. Through all the possible cases I could examine, I concluded that Tomcat MIME type addition now supports only ROOT app.", "id": 224, "time": "2000-11-16T07:25:35Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2000-11-16T07:25:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 246, "is_private": false, "id": 5384, "time": "2001-09-11T17:43:28Z", "creator": "Larry.Isaacs@sas.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-11T17:43:28Z", "tags": [], "text": "Since this bug is reported against Tomcat 3.1.1, where no further development\nis occuring, I'm marking this bug as \"wontfix\".\n\nA quick test in Tomcat 3.2.3 and Tomcat 3.3 showed <mime-mapping> in the\nweb.xml was working."}]
