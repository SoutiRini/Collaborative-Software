It was so many times that I had to deal with\nrequest that seemingly hang having to go through every Thread's trace stack to\nfind out what the hang request is stuck on.\n\nIt would be great if \"RequestProcessor\" MBean has a reference to the Thread,\nwhich is dealing with the request in question by either ID or Name. (Name is\npreferred for backwards compatibility)\n\nWe (as in LambdaProbe project) would link the \"http request\" to thread trace\nstack thus providing one mouse click resolution to the problem of stuck requests.\n\nMany thanks,\nVlad"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41128, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Do you want to submit a patch?", "id": 101000, "time": "2007-03-26T20:44:18Z", "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-03-26T20:44:18Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41128, "attachment_id": 19820, "text": "Created attachment 19820\npatch against the current http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/current/tc5.5.x", "id": 101073, "time": "2007-03-27T17:11:58Z", "creator": "vlad@jstripe.com", "creation_time": "2007-03-27T17:11:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41128, "attachment_id": 19821, "text": "Created attachment 19821\npatch against the current http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk", "id": 101074, "time": "2007-03-27T17:12:37Z", "creator": "vlad@jstripe.com", "creation_time": "2007-03-27T17:12:37Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41128, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Gladly :) The patches are attached.\n\nBoth patches worked ok for me.
