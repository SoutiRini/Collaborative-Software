I have\nApache 2.2.6 compiled on a Solaris 9 sparc server. After the 13th day\nof operation, the httpd decided to display the config file\n(httpd.conf) to my browser!  It's very odd. My compilation options\nwere:\n\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 \\\n   --disable-imap \\\n   --disable-userdir \\\n --enable-so \\\n --enable-expires \\\n --with-mpm=worker \\\n --enable-ssl --with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl \\\n --enable-usertrack \\\n --enable-rewrite=shared \\\n --enable-headers=shared\n\nThe same compile options I used on Apache 2.0.52 without any problems for years.\n\nI also ran a log rotation shell script that renames the log files that\nappends a timestamp and do an 'apachectl graceful', every midnight.\n\nI can provide the httpd.conf by email.  It is essentially a vanilla setup, no\nthird party modules.\n\nThis error message was found in the error_log this morning after the graceful\nrestart.\n\n[Mon Nov 19 23:59:02 2007] [notice] Apache/2.2.6 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.6     # prob\nably should define those extensions to indicate media types:\\n    #\\n    AddType\n application/x-compress .Z\\n    AddType application/x-gzip .gz .tgz\\n\\n    #\\n\n  # AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to \"handlers\":\\n    # a\nctions unrelated to filetype.
