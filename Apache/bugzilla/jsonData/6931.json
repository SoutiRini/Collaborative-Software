[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "kdowney@amberarcher.com", "text": "In WebLogic 6.1, you get warnings about the home and remote and other classes \nappearing on the system CLASSPATH if put those classes in the wlclasspath--\nthat's well documented. \n\nSupposedly one should be able to specify a separate <classpath> element \nalongside <wlclasspath> that supplies these classes and just put the weblogic \nJAR files in wlclasspath and eliminate these errors, but my experience has been \nthat it is ignored--you have a choice of getting the warnings or of it not \nworking at all. Consulting the source bears this out: there is no place that \nthe -classpath argument to weblogic.ejbc is added to the javaTask object. The \nwlclasspath eventually ends up as the SYSTEM classpath, as intended:\n\n            javaTask.setFork(true);\n            if (classpath != null) {\n                javaTask.setClasspath(classpath);\n            }\n\nbut the generic classpath does not have a corresponding\n\n            javaTask.createArg().setValue(\"-classpath\");\n            javaTask.createArg().setLine(classpath);\n\nto add the argument to weblogic.ejbc. Also, it seems classpath is overwritten \nby the value of wlClasspath, so even if that did happen, you'd get the system \nclasspath instead of the <classpath> path value.\n\n--kd", "id": 11519, "time": "2002-03-06T17:59:48Z", "bug_id": 6931, "creation_time": "2002-03-06T17:59:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 6931, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed - Please test in next nightly build (2002-05-01)", "id": 15120, "time": "2002-04-30T13:35:09Z", "creator": "conor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-30T13:35:09Z", "is_private": false}]
