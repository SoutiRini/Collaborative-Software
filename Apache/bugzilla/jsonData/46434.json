Idea was to start accepting issues which are specific to versions above Java 1.4 and use this issue as a blocker. This also seems the proper place to attach patches which help accomplishing the task (of dropping Java 1.4 support).\n\nMarked Batik version 1.8 as the version where this is experienced, although it would be more natural to mark as a \"Target Milestone\" instead (which currently has no items). Side note: if \"Target Milestone\"s are to be created, I'd suggest at least two items: \"1.8\" (next release as of this writing) and \"next\"/\"future\" or similar to mean an unscheduled/unplanned release somewhere in the future.\n\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45397#c1", "id": 123479, "time": "2008-12-22T07:36:09Z", "bug_id": 46434, "creation_time": "2008-12-22T07:36:09Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 123481, "time": "2008-12-22T07:44:12Z", "bug_id": 46434, "creation_time": "2008-12-22T07:44:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "That can be read like there are already efforts underway to remove Java 1.4 support.

Of course this was not my intention. ;-) Yes, this will likely take some time, even if the EOL period for the (Standard Edition) has already been reached [1] a couple of months ago.\n\nIdea was just to allow some sort of tracking for this future action. The text in comment 0 somehow states that, although probably I should have made it more clear.

Nevertheless, I'm decreasing priority again, as IMHO this should be handled only _after_ the 1.8 release (see comment 5) - I'm creating a thread in Batik users to have a better information basis to evaluate this.\n\n[1] http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-general/201011.mbox/browser#msg-12", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 46434, "id": 141524, "time": "2010-11-07T03:28:56Z", "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-11-07T03:28:56Z", "attachment_id": null}]
