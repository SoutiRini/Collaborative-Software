Similar things are implemented in modules like mpm_itk and mod_privileges (and IBM's mod_authnz_saf) but they don't piggyback on the User directive.  \n\nThere's a lot more to worry about when you start doing something per-request vs\nonce per process.", "id": 202066, "time": "2017-11-11T19:52:51Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-11-11T19:52:51Z", "is_private": false}]
