I would like know whether Apache did come out the fix \nfor the below problem. Thanks alot.\n\n\n\n##########################\nThere is a bug in Apache2.0 mod_ssl which prevents from jointly treating \nmethod POST with an authentification customer by certificate.\n\nThe problem appears when the level of authentification (SSLVerifyClient) is \nhigher on the level of a Location directive than on the level of the virtual \nhost.\n\nThe message which appears in the logs is then \n[error] SSL Re-negotiation in conjunction with POST method not supported! \\ \nnhint: try SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate\n\nPossible parades:\n\n\nTo use a as constraining directive on the level of the virtual host as in the \ndirective hiring (walk with optional)\nto use a special port for the forms requiring method POST and SSLVerifyClient. \nTo bring the SSLVerifyClient directive to the level of the virtual host. The \ndirective is then extended to all the virtual host\n############################", "id": 89696, "time": "2006-06-02T11:56:55Z", "creator": "cc.chen@fsd.com.my", "creation_time": "2006-06-02T11:56:55Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39705, "is_private": false, "id": 89720, "creation_time": "2006-06-02T22:54:42Z", "time": "2006-06-02T22:54:42Z", "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 12355 ***", "attachment_id": null}]
