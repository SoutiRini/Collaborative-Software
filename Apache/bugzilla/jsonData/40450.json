Nevertheless, I'm not sure what should happen instead: remove that catch block, maybe? In that case, what about other exceptions (I/O, thread death, etc.)?\n\nI'd say this could be marked invalid as the OOM exception seems to be the actual problem (incorrect dimensioning of the JVM memory)... Marking as need info in order to call for feedback. ;-)  Also, please consider marking as invalid if you feel (like I do) that the swallowing the exception is at least coherent with other exceptions being handled in a \"best-effort\" fashion."}]
