[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I get an error when calling a servlet that uses log4j. To further narrow the\nproblem down I did the following:\n\n- I created a log4j.properties file and some java-classes. \n- I created one class which was both a servlet and had a main method.\n- I compiled my whole project and put the log4j.properties file in my\n%webapp%\\WEB-INF\\classes directory.\n- I called the class directly using java LinkGenerator from the\n%webapp%\\WEB-INF\\classes directory and had immediate succes. Everything logged\nnicely and the debug messages I wanted to see I saw.\n- I used my browser to call the exact same class using:\nhttp://localhost:8080/servlet/LinkGenerator. In my console window a message\nappeared that told me that log4j hadn't been initialized properly. \n\nAm I in error here? Should I send this to Tomcat bugzilla instead?\n\nPlease let me know,\n\nMartin van Dijken", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 8021, "id": 13379, "time": "2002-04-12T15:02:39Z", "creator": "sunsear@raketnet.nl", "creation_time": "2002-04-12T15:02:39Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Martin,\n\nThis is a support request, not a bug report.
