Maybe an\nadditional error message for file not found vs. no properties found would be\nhelpful.  Being an admin and not a developer, this is more of a big deal because\nmost config files aren't so stringent about spaces.  I spent way too long on\nthat one!  I hope documentation could be update to reflect it, because it wasn't\nclear from my reading... the whole properties and XML usage to configure\nsoftware is bad enough for us admins :)\n\nThanks for your time and great software.\n\ndpk", "count": 0, "id": 71806, "time": "2005-03-04T02:51:21Z", "creator": "dennis.kelly@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-03-04T02:51:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Along similar lines, it would be helpful if the workers.properties documentation mentioned how \n`continuation lines' were handled.
