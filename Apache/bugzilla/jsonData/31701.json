The problem is with the handler for\nthe <ex:escapeHtml> tag:\norg.apache.taglibs.standard.examples.taglib.EscapeHtmlTag. In 1.0.5, it appears\nto properly evaluate EL expressions. However, for 1.0.6, it looks like a 1.1\nversion leaked in so that EL expressions are no longer evaluated by the\nhandler.\n--- snap ---\n\nToday I used the 'EscapeHtmlTag.java' from version 1.0.5 and after rebuilding\nthe 'standard-examples.war' file the 'ShowSources.jsp' file correctly prints the\nSource code of any example.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "justyna.horwat@sun.com", "is_private": false, "id": 65286, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 31701, "creation_time": "2004-10-18T18:46:47Z", "time": "2004-10-18T18:46:47Z", "text": "In my commit message I forgot to thank Kris Schneider for pointing out the source of the problem. I'm \nsorry and I wanted to make sure Kris got the recognition for the fix.\n\nYes, it looks like a 1.1 version of the EscapeHtmlTag got leaked in. I checked the cvs histories and I \nbelieve this happened when the examples were re-packaged. Since I use a JSP 2.0 container, I didn't \nnotice any problems. Thanks for catching the bug!\n\nI went ahead and enabled EL expression evaluation in the EscapeHtmlTag tag handler so that it works in \na pre-JSP 2.0 container.
