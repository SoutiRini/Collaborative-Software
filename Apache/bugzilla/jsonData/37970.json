So just switching to a call of \nSession.getInstance(props, null) would work fine for me."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "svn revision 695827", "is_private": false, "id": 120677, "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "time": "2008-09-16T05:20:26Z", "bug_id": 37970, "creation_time": "2008-09-16T05:20:26Z", "attachment_id": null}]
