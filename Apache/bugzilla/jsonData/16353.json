The way it actually worked earlier was \nit compiled only those files which are changed. As a sample i have attached a \ntar file in which there are below components( i can not figure out where to \nattach files).\n1. src - contains a Test java file\n2. dest - dir where Test.java is compiled\n3. build.xml for ant\n4. runant.sh - file to run ant(contains java home and ant home settings). This \ncan be avoided.\n\nThanks in advance\n-jai", "count": 0, "id": 29915, "time": "2003-01-23T06:57:44Z", "bug_id": 16353, "creation_time": "2003-01-23T06:57:44Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": 4518, "tags": [], "creator": "jai_kishan_sharma@hotmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 4518\nContains the sample code that i used to test ANT(.gz file)", "count": 1, "id": 29916, "time": "2003-01-23T06:59:01Z", "bug_id": 16353, "creation_time": "2003-01-23T06:59:01Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16353, "is_private": false, "text": "Your directory hiearchy does not match your package structure.
