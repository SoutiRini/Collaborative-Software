Within \nthis script I need to know where JAVA_HOME is so I can include the jni.h file in my C compilation \npath.  Previous to your new wrapper script, I had my own, which exported JAVA_HOME and all \nworked wonderfully.\n\nI have made the following one line change to your script and would suggest something similar:\n\ncase \"`uname`\" in\n  CYGWIN*) cygwin=true ;;\n  Darwin*) darwin=true\n           if [ -z \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n             JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home\n             export JAVA_HOME\n           fi\n           ;;\nesac\n\nThanks for listening, and keep up the excellent work!  Ant is great!\n\nCheers,\n\nLevi"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24694, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 24553 ***", "id": 72613, "time": "2005-03-17T16:35:36Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-17T16:35:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "This bug was closed because \"This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 24553\" which is incorrect.  \nBug 24553 is dealing with ANT_HOME, while this bug is related to JAVA_HOME which are completely \ndifferent.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 72618, "creation_time": "2005-03-17T17:07:58Z", "time": "2005-03-17T17:07:58Z", "creator": "labrown@efn.org", "bug_id": 24694, "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "Oops, yes, sorry.\n", "id": 72619, "time": "2005-03-17T17:14:10Z", "bug_id": 24694, "creation_time": "2005-03-17T17:14:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
