By encoding in mod_dav, this now ends up double encoding the URI.  For the most part Subversion no longer uses the Location header to get information from mod_dav as we've shifted to our HTTPv2 protocol that doesn't use have to use PROPFIND to detect resource URIs.  However, older clients talking to newer servers or newer clients talking to older servers still do.  Any server that's been upgraded to httpd 2.2.25 or 2.4.6 that includes this change breaks those clients when dealing with paths that need proper encoding (e.g. paths with spaces).\n\nEssentially the PR54611 was an API change since it changed the meaning of a field.\n\nI plan to revert the P54611 change and fix the problem in mod_dav_fs.  This means that sites with 2.2.25 or 2.4.6 can upgrade httpd without necessarily having to upgrading Subversion.  For some of these sites upgrading Subversion might not be a possible alternative since they may be using the no longer supported 1.6.x line.  In fact due to the protocol versioning issues mentioned above 1.6.x servers are guaranteed to have this issue regardless of the client version users are using."}, {"text": "Fixed on trunk with r1529559.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 55397, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 170444, "time": "2013-10-06T01:09:41Z", "creator": "ben@reser.org", "creation_time": "2013-10-06T01:09:41Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "text": "Needed r1531505 as well, previous commit missed encoding the children of the collection when PROPFIND depth wasn't 0.", "bug_id": 55397, "is_private": false, "id": 170581, "time": "2013-10-12T06:14:42Z", "creator": "ben@reser.org", "creation_time": "2013-10-12T06:14:42Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55397, "text": "I believe that last r1531505 breaks mod_dav_svn from 1.8.8:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/subversion/+bug/1284641", "id": 173487, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "stephane.chazelas@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-02-26T10:39:34Z", "time": "2014-02-26T10:39:34Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55397, "text": "(In reply to Stephane Chazelas from comment #3)\n> I believe that last r1531505 breaks mod_dav_svn from 1.8.8:\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/subversion/+bug/1284641\n\nSorry, meant r1529559 above.", "id": 173488, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "stephane.chazelas@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-02-26T10:40:54Z", "time": "2014-02-26T10:40:54Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55397, "text": "(In reply to Stephane Chazelas from comment #4)\n> (In reply to Stephane Chazelas from comment #3)\n> > I believe that last r1531505 breaks mod_dav_svn from 1.8.8:\n> > https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/subversion/+bug/1284641\n> \n> Sorry, meant r1529559 above.\n\nr1529559 can't do anythign to SVN.
