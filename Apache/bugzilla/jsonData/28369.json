May be are there other untranslated validation messages,\n    I figured out some use cases, but not all.\n\n  * Conflict with the meanings of the message with key=\"admin\": it should\n    be split into two keys. Within the \"Site | CA Auth\" form, in the context\n    of the \"role\" column, \"admin\" should be translated as \"administrer\" (verb)\n    in french; in the context of the \"group\" selection list, it should be\n    translated as \"administrateur\" (noun). For now, I left \"admin.\" in french.\n\n    I suggest to define specific keys for these field values:\n    message keys=\"ac-auth-role.values.visit|review|admin|edit\"\n\n  * Same problem for the message with key=\"review\": conflicting meanings in the\n    contexts of \"Site | Workflow\" vs \"Site | CA Auth\" forms: \"r\u00e9viser\" should\n    be displayed as \"r\u00e9vision\" in the context of the \"Site | Workflow: Status\",\n    \"r\u00e9viser\" in the context of \"Site | CA Auth: Role\".\n\n    I suggest to define specific keys for these field values:\n    message keys=\"workflow-status.value.edit|review|live\"\n\n  * Within the \"Site | Schedule\" form, for active jobs, the \"Modify\" and \"Delete\"\n    buttons are not translated. There is a message key for \"Delete\", which is\n    ignored, and no message key for \"Modify\". Same problem for jobs with\n    expired dates: the \"Delete\" button is not translated.\n\n  SPECIAL IDIOMS\n\n  * \"Server time\" was translated with \"Horodate\", which means \"Time stamp\";\n    it seems more accurate to me and \"Temps serveur\" is somewhat weird;\n    does this \"time stamp\" meaning also fit the purpose of this message?\n\n  * \"Language version\" was always translated with \"traduction\" (\"translation\"),\n    i.e. \"New language version\" = \"Nouvelle traduction\"; \"Remove language\n    version\" = \"Supprimer la traduction\", etc. I could not find a better\n    short translation of \"new language version\". Translated acurately, it\n    would be \"Nouvelle version dans une nouvelle langue\"; \"remove language\n    version\" would be \"Supprimer la version dans la langue courante\".\n\n  * \"Authoring\" was always translated with \"r\u00e9daction\"; \"Authoring area\"\n    with \"espace de r\u00e9daction\".\n\n  * Le terme \"workflow\" a \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9 en anglais; pardon pour l'entorse,\n    mais \"d\u00e9roulement des op\u00e9rations\" g\u00e2che la concision des titres des menus!", "count": 2, "id": 55727, "time": "2004-04-13T23:12:57Z", "creator": "olange@petit-atelier.ch", "creation_time": "2004-04-13T23:12:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "agallardo@agsoftware.dnsalias.com", "text": "I will translate to spanish, where can I find the default english file?", "id": 55729, "time": "2004-04-13T23:41:58Z", "bug_id": 28369, "creation_time": "2004-04-13T23:41:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "roku@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "The master key file is the english translation at the same time.\nOne will find the translation file(s) at\n\nlenya/resources/i18n/cmsui.xml\nlenya/pubs/@@pub@@/lenya/resources/i18n/cmsui.xml\n\nMaybe the last one contains translations Olivier Lange was looking for.\nIt is a publication specific dictionary containing pub local messages like for\nthe \"Create Document\" screen.\n\nThanks for ur help :)", "id": 55734, "time": "2004-04-14T06:03:40Z", "bug_id": 28369, "creation_time": "2004-04-14T06:03:40Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28369, "is_private": false, "count": 5, "id": 55740, "time": "2004-04-14T07:03:33Z", "creator": "roku@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-04-14T07:03:33Z", "text": "I comitted the french translation and will review Oliviers comments next.\nThank u Olivier."}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "olange@petit-atelier.ch", "text": "Created attachment 11226\nLenya GUI: french translations updated 14.04.2004 (main + pubs/default, special chars as character references)", "id": 55751, "time": "2004-04-14T09:58:48Z", "bug_id": 28369, "creation_time": "2004-04-14T09:58:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 11226}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28369, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 55752, "time": "2004-04-14T10:07:14Z", "creator": "olange@petit-atelier.ch", "creation_time": "2004-04-14T10:07:14Z", "text": "I just sent an updated version of the french translation of the main and the\npublication specific dictionaries.\n\nThis updated version replaces my previous attachment, which did not contain the\npublication specific dictionary translation.\n\nI reported some keys as missing in the main dictionary.
