I'm running debian, and I will use \n\n   /etc/init.d/apache2 restart \n\nwhen I need to restart, but I may use apache2ctl restart, and run into the same issue.  I've tried running an strace, and the last action is always \n\n   rt_sigaction(SIGINT, {0x807b920, [], SA_RESTORER, 0xb7d999e8}, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0\n\nfollowed by a waitpid.  Since this is not a frequent occurrence though, I have not caught it in the act, so to speak; these observations are only in trying to get it going again after it has started to hang like this.  The resolution has always been to restart the whole machine.\n\nIn terms of configuration, apache is configured with \n\n    mod_jk/1.2.18 mod_python/3.2.10 Python/2.4.4 PHP/5.2.0-8+etch13 mod_ssl/2.2.3 OpenSSL/0.9.8c mod_perl/2.0.2 Perl/v5.8.8\n\nwhere mod_jk sends any requests for jsp pages to tomcat 5.5.\n\nI also looked at the apache error logs, and the only thing in there is \n\n[notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.", "id": 125853, "time": "2009-03-27T09:56:25Z", "bug_id": 46928, "creation_time": "2009-03-27T09:56:25Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46928, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This bug report looks more like it belongs to users@ for clarification -- and most importantly: Information gathering.", "id": 142601, "time": "2010-12-12T10:56:53Z", "creator": "i.galic@brainsware.org", "creation_time": "2010-12-12T10:56:53Z", "is_private": false}]
