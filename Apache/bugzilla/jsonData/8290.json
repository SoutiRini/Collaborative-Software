[{"count": 0, "text": "There is a big performance penalty incured by the way the code is generated \nwith taglibs in both Jasper and Jasper 2.  Both version use a lot of nested \ntry/finally block, and these constructs triggers a bug in the JVM.  This \nbug is documented there:\n\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4414162.html\n\nIt was closed as \"not fixed\" for the JDK 1.3, but it is still present at \nleast in the 1.4 Linux's implementation, and probably others too:\njava version \"1.4.0\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.0-b92)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.0-b92, mixed mode)\n\nWe did some light load test and if a page has 100 tags, a 256M JVM can not \nsustain the load.  The GC would periodically freeze the JVM from 10s. to \n45s. on a PIII 800 with 512M.  The load is a 5 thread JMeter test of \naccessing the \"large\" JSP (100 tags), with a small JSP (only links), and a \n500ms timer sleep.  No other access are done on the PC, JMeter is run from \na remote PC.\n\nIn our tests, we have shown that by far the worst performance penalty are \ndue to this bug.  If we only put a global \"try/finally\" in the java code \ngenerated from the JSP and recompile by hand the java code, then the \nperformance are very much comparable to other servlet servers.\n\nThanks.", "bug_id": 8290, "is_private": false, "id": 14037, "time": "2002-04-19T02:31:12Z", "creator": "benoitde@sympatico.ca", "creation_time": "2002-04-19T02:31:12Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8290, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 15099, "time": "2002-04-30T08:41:20Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-30T08:41:20Z", "text": "I've applied the patch for this in Jasper 2.\nThanks !\n\nThe 4.1.1 milestone will have the fix."}, {"count": 2, "text": "*** Bug 9120 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "bug_id": 8290, "attachment_id": null, "id": 16185, "time": "2002-05-15T17:46:37Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-05-15T17:46:37Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8290, "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 2090 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 17237, "time": "2002-06-05T23:26:15Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-06-05T23:26:15Z", "attachment_id": null}]
