The .zip download (the one I normally use) is \nfine.  Looks like someone tried an ASCII mode FTP of some of the .class files, \nresulting in a linefeed byte being added at the end.  This was not a problem in \n5.5.15. \n\n - Chuck \n\nAnd the following message from Yoav Shapira-2\n\nHey, \nSorry for the late response on this, I've been swamped. \n\nWhat's the consensus of the committers, are we in decent shape to do a \n5.5.17 release?  I have time for it this weekend.  I will test the \n.exe in 5.5.17 prior to uploading to make sure it's alright. \n\nYoav \n", "is_private": false, "id": 87429, "creator": "huang.xingang@gmail.com", "time": "2006-03-30T14:51:15Z", "bug_id": 39149, "creation_time": "2006-03-30T14:51:15Z", "attachment_id": null}]
