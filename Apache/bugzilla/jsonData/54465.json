I am performing JMeter load testing for \napplication. \nI have developed one application in JSP with Struts which contains two \npages.\nThe First page contains Login Page which contains fields like username & \npassword with Submit button.\nIf i will enter the URL in IE ie., \nhttp://IPAdderess/ApplicationName/login.jsp  this page is recording. After \nentering username & password with submit button the navigation is going to \nsecond page but its not recorded by JMeter proxy server. Suppose if i \nclick on Logout Link in Second page logout link is recording.\n\nI perform any action on buttons JMeter is not performing recording.
