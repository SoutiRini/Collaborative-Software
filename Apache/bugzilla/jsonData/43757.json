But, the HTTP 500 response incorrectly points to the line number of the\nfirst occurrence of response.sendRedirect, whether it is commented out or not.\nThis makes debugging quite a pain.\n\nWith my recent discovery of the cause of the exception I feel that I set the\nseverity of this a bit high. I was not sure if it was my place to correct it, so\ndemote away if you'd like.\n\nThank you for the swift response!"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43757, "text": "Look at the generated java a little closer.\n\nYou'll notice after the commented code something like this: \nout.println(\"\\n\")\n\nBecause there is whitespace at the end of the file after the %>\n\nSo if one tried to write AFTER a redirect is done - you get an ISE.\n\nYou need\nif (someCondition) {\n  response.sendRedirect(\"./index.jsp\");\n  return;\n}\n", "id": 110082, "time": "2007-10-31T17:32:55Z", "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "creation_time": "2007-10-31T17:32:55Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "beefnog@gmail.com", "text": "(In reply to comment #3)\n> Look at the generated java a little closer.\n> You'll notice after the commented code something like this: \n> out.println(\"\\n\")\n> Because there is whitespace at the end of the file after the %>\n> So if one tried to write AFTER a redirect is done - you get an ISE.\n> You need\n> if (someCondition) {\n>   response.sendRedirect(\"./index.jsp\");\n>   return;\n> }\n\nYou are correct, and I noted the cause (a little less verbosely) in my reply \nto Mark Thomas' response.
