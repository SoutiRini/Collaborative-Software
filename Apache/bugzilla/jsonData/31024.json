Just adding z to the parameter should do it. For example:\n\n  \"%d{yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss z} %p [%t] %c - %m%n\"\n\nAs an alternative you could write a PatternConverter dealing only with timezones. \nThis is rather easy to achieve in log4j 1.3. See http://www.qos.ch/logging/\nPatternLayout.html  for more info.\n\nAs this report is more a help request than a bug report, I am closing it. If you \nneed further help please contact to the log4j-user@logging.apache.org mailing list.\n\nHope this helps,", "id": 63664, "time": "2004-09-16T14:16:00Z", "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-09-16T14:16:00Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
