On z/OS, we saw this causing 400 errors because ap_rgetline() doesn't skip to http_in->next, and mod_charset_lite was filtering the \\r\\n that terminates chunks (and, potentially, trailer lines).\n\nA simple patch is attached which simply makes mod_charset_lite and mod_ext_filter skip reads which have modes other than AP_MODE_READBYTES set, just like mod_deflate.", "id": 183611, "time": "2015-06-17T17:55:54Z", "creator": "Chaosed0@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-06-17T17:55:54Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58049, "text": "Thanks, r1686085 and will propose for 2.4.", "count": 1, "id": 183612, "time": "2015-06-17T18:29:20Z", "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-06-17T18:29:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58049, "text": "Backported to 2.4.15 in r1686272.", "id": 183628, "time": "2015-06-18T17:10:11Z", "creator": "ylavic.dev@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-06-18T17:10:11Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
