When you need a different shutdown\n#   approach you can use one of the following variables:\n#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:\n#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no\n#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates\n#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use\n#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where\n#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.\n#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:\n#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a\n#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify\n#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in\n#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use\n#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation\n#     works correctly. \n#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP\n#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable\n#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable \"nokeepalive\" for this.\n#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround\n#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables \"downgrade-1.0\" and\n#   \"force-response-1.0\" for this.\nBrowserMatch \".*MSIE.*\" \\\n         nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \\\n         downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\n\n\n#   Per-Server Logging:\n#   The home of a custom SSL log file.
