The changes made to SyslogAppender and SyslogWriter (I'm using 1.2.16) are causing new messages to be generated when the 1024 limit is reached.\n\nReverting back to 1.2.14 does indeed solve the issue.\n\nI understand the need and desire to be compliant with the standards, but I can't see any harm in adding a \"maxMessageSize\" field to the SyslogAppender class and re-factoring the code as needed.\n\nThanks"}]
