The Problem is, that the webserver does not found the zlib.dll. \nThere is a zlib1.dll in the bin folder. If you copy this dll and rename it without the \"1\" in the name, everything works perfect.\nSo there is a conflict with this zlib1.dll and zlib.dll that should be solved.\n\nOther people have the same problem. See for example the comments at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Els0EDM1-So\n\nThank you for your engagement on the super webserver Apache !\nCheers Daniel", "id": 142679, "time": "2010-12-14T11:10:40Z", "bug_id": 50473, "creation_time": "2010-12-14T11:10:40Z", "is_private": false}]
