Therefore, those two\nentries had better be removed. They are of no practical value and are just\ntaking up spaces in the file to confuse ignorant web administrators. \n\nSecondly, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-CN(GB2312), and EUC-TW are all legitimate\ncharacter encoding schemes strictly compliant to ISO 2022[1]. Putting them\ntogether with Shift_JIS and Big5 that are NOT compliant to ISO 2022 under the\ncategory of MIME charsets that are not mapped to a specific standard is misleading. \n\nThirdly, both UTF-7 and UTF-8 are specified in ISO 10646 and Unicode so that\nthey should not be grouped together with Shift_JIS and Big5, either. In case of\nUTF-7, I doubt it's wise to list it (there might be a handful of sites that use\nUTF-7, but I'm pretty sure it'd not take many hands to count them all). \n\nFinally, I have a reservation about using ISO-10646-UCS-2 and ISO-10646-UCS4.\nI'd rather list UTF-16(LE|BE) and UTF-32(LE|BE) in their places.\n\n\n\n[1] They are used to encode ISO-2022 compliant coded character sets, JIS X\n0201/ISO 646:JP, KS X 1003/ISO 646:KR, JIS X 0208, JIS X 0212, CNS 11643, KS X\n1001, GB2312-80, and so forth in the manner specified by ISO 2022.", "id": 44817, "time": "2003-09-29T07:57:15Z", "bug_id": 23474, "creation_time": "2003-09-29T07:57:15Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "rbowen@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 69089, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 23474, "creation_time": "2004-12-30T18:04:30Z", "time": "2004-12-30T18:04:30Z", "text": "Could you possibly provide a patch to fix this situation.
