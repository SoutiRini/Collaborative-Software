[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9439, "text": "In trying to get mod_jk to work on Solaris 8 for apache 2.0.35, i found a \nproblem in the startup, which is that the function init_jk was getting called \nmultiple times when it should not have been. This led to the number of workers \nbeing doubled and then it was not working.\n\nThe fix is simple: add the same check that appears in the function \njk_post_config to the child_init function, so that the code reads as follows:\nif(!conf->was_initialized) {\n     conf->was_initialized = JK_TRUE;        \n     init_jk( pconf, conf, s );\n}\n\ninstead of just calling the init_jk without that check.\n\nI also found that apxs was not working as expected, perhaps due to the fact \nthat it was missing -G in the gcc command, but I am not sure", "id": 16771, "time": "2002-05-27T11:09:09Z", "creator": "drosenstark@alchemedia.com", "creation_time": "2002-05-27T11:09:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hgomez@slib.fr", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed in current jk 1.2.0 CVS", "id": 18331, "time": "2002-06-21T15:38:29Z", "bug_id": 9439, "creation_time": "2002-06-21T15:38:29Z", "is_private": false}]
