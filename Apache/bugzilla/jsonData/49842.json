(No context info available)\n\nand can handle them in my EventListener. But I don't get the events\n\n3. Unable to obtain stream from system identifier 'file:////C4711/A1/xml/images/MyPic.svg'\n4. The Source that was returned from URI resolution didn't contain an InputStream for URI: images/MyPic.svg\n\nthat are just logged to the Java logger as SEVERE messages.
