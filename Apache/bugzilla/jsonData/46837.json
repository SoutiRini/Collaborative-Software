There is also a security impact: a user who can control the name of files on a web server could inject responses that appear to come from other web sites served by the same system.\n\nOn Mac OS X, this may be reproduced by\n\ntouch ~/Sites/'junk\nHeader: Injected\nblah:.jpg'\n\nand then requesting\n\nhttp://localhost/~$USER/junk%0aHeader:%20Injected%0ablah:\n\nThe CVE description claims the bug is present in 2.2.6 and earlier.
