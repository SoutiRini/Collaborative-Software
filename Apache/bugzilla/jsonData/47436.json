Since a CompositeGraphicsNode (a 'g' element) has\nno content of it's own.  What I believe you mean is that when\nsetVisible(false) is called on a composite graphics node it's\nchildren are still painted - which is true and correct.\n\n> Proposed solution:\n> in file org/apache/batik/gvt/AbstractGraphicsNode.java add the following at the\n> beginning of method \"public void paint(Graphics2D g2d)\":\n> \n> if (!isVisible())\n>     return;\n\n   This would break the following SVG content:\n\n     <g visibility=\"hidden\">\n        <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"50\" visibility=\"visible\"\n              fill=\"red\"/>\n     </g>\n\n    I can understand that if you are using the GVT tree independent of\nSVG that this might be confusing.", "is_private": false, "id": 128379, "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "time": "2009-06-29T02:56:09Z", "bug_id": 47436, "creation_time": "2009-06-29T02:56:09Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47436, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 128380, "time": "2009-06-29T02:56:50Z", "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-06-29T02:56:50Z", "text": "Setting bug status."}]
