The classpath should be able to find these optional tasks\nas they are in the java.class.path, and also I have tried to copy the library\nand direct them to it with paths, filesets... within the classpath attribute,\nbut Ant will not find the class.  Even the available task cannot find them using\nexplicit paths.\n\nThis is an important feature towards making builds portable across environments.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "I don't think I understand what you are trying to do.
