I have now successfully installed tomcat 8 using sudo apt-get install tomcat8 on a linux mint 18 machine (a debian like build). If I try and install this file with eclipse however I get the following error: \n\n\nDescription Resource    Path    Location    Type\nThe container 'Apache Tomcat v8.0 [Apache Tomcat v8.0]' references non existing library '/usr/share/tomcat8/lib/commons-dbcp.jar'   helloworld2     Build path  Build Path Problem\n\n\nInvestigating the problem I have found that the tomcat8 installation creates danling symlinks. I have gone ahead and purged all of the previous installations and reinstalled a fresh copy and sure enough: \n\npatientplatypus@next /usr/share/tomcat8/lib $ sudo chmod u+x commons-dbcp.jar\nchmod: cannot operate on dangling symlink 'commons-dbcp.jar'\n\nSo it would seem that on a completely fresh install there are libraries that are missing that break tomcat.\n\nIs there a fix for this?
