Currently, the documentation says it's set to uid by default, which is a problem if you do no want to use the default filter. I though about ignoring attribute if it's not present, but that might break compatibility. I'm fine with my patch's approach, but if you think another one is better, just tell me, I'll rework the patch.", "id": 145451, "time": "2011-04-01T05:29:58Z", "bug_id": 51005, "creation_time": "2011-04-01T05:29:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51005, "attachment_id": 26822, "id": 145452, "time": "2011-04-01T05:31:17Z", "creator": "julien@danjou.info", "creation_time": "2011-04-01T05:31:17Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 26822\nPatch implementing that"}]
