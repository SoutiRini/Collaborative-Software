In my \nwebapp I use some normal anchor-tags to link to those documents so that they \nget displayed in the browser or downloaded (depending on client configuration).\n\nWith Tomcat 4.1.X everything worked well but after switching to Tomcat 5.0.24 \nthe request of PDFs using Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0.2800.1106 (SP1) now \nlead to errors. Just this (unfortunately very important) browser is now unable \nto display and/or download those PDF files. With Mozilla everything still works.\n\nI use a SSL Coyote HTTP/1.1 connector on port 443. This SSL connector seems to \nbe the problem - as a non-SSL-connector still works fine with all target \nbrowsers. Just SSL is the problem here.\n\n        <Connector port=\"443\"\n                   maxThreads=\"150\" minSpareThreads=\"25\" maxSpareThreads=\"75\"\n                   enableLookups=\"false\" disableUploadTimeout=\"true\"\n                   acceptCount=\"100\" debug=\"0\" scheme=\"https\" secure=\"true\" \nURIEncoding=\"UTF-8\">\n          <Factory keystoreFile=\"/root/.keystore\"\n               keystorePass=\"changeit\"\n               clientAuth=\"false\" protocol=\"TLS\"/>\n        </Connector>\n\nMaybe I have a hint, too: in the past I experienced some problems with dynamic \ndownloads perfomed by a servlet over SLL (using MS IE 6 as the client). MS IE 6 \nseems to have a bug when downloading binary data over SSL. In my download-\nservlet I had to turn of caching...\n\n    response.setHeader(\"Expires\", \"0\");\n    response.setHeader(\"Cache-Control\", \"must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-\ncheck=0\");\n    response.setHeader(\"Pragma\", \"public\");\n\n...to get it to work with MS IE 6.\n\nAgain, everything worked fine under Tomcat 4.1.X with its original SSL \nconnector (used by default up to version 4.1.27).\n\nBest wishes\n\nIngo"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29336, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 27122 ***", "id": 58560, "time": "2004-06-02T16:06:09Z", "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "creation_time": "2004-06-02T16:06:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
