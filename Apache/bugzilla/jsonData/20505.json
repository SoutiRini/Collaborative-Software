This  supports:\n               1. A start time and end time for test - The test iterations will\nstart at the specified time and end at the end time. If the testplan specifies\nthe number of iterations, it will take precedence over the end time.\n               2. A start time alone and the number of iterations the test must run.\n\nHow the Scheduler developed:\n  1. In ThreadGroupGui will have both the StartTime and EndTime.\n  2. These values are passed to the JMeterThread from the StandardJMeterEngine\nusing the ThreadGroup (ConfigElement)  object.\n  3. In JMeterThread will have two method for controlling the  Scheduler\n                      1. startScheduler()\n                      2. stopScheduler()\n     startScheduler() :\n              This will sleep the JMeterThread based on the starttime and\nSystemCurrentTime.\n     stopScheduler() :\n             This will stop the Scheduler based on the EndTime\n\n     How to work on Scheduler :\n\n  1. First enable the Scheduler checkbok in the ThreadGroupPanel.\n  2. The Scheduler configuration panel will be displayed.\n  3. The Panel have two Fields StartTime and EndTime.\n  4. StartTime and EndTime fields have the time control in his fields.\n  5. Set the StartTime and EndTime in the time control fields.\n  6. Start the test, The will start all the JMeterThread in the ThreadGroup. But\nthese Threads will sleep upto the\nstarttime specified in the scheduler.\n  7.This scheduled endtime will be notified by the JMeterThread itself, each end\nof the iteration the JMeterThread will check whether the scheduled endtime is\nreached.\n"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 20505, "text": "Created attachment 6670\nBugid20505.jar from Message-id: <3EE025AA.8000605@siptech.co.in>", "id": 38491, "time": "2003-06-06T11:22:29Z", "creator": "tjsb@slb.com", "creation_time": "2003-06-06T11:22:29Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 6670}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "mstover1@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "This is very cool - thanks!", "id": 38502, "time": "2003-06-06T14:46:27Z", "bug_id": 20505, "creation_time": "2003-06-06T14:46:27Z", "is_private": false}]
