[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "mmay@apache.org", "text": "There seems to be a bug in the JAVA Request Defaults. I have done the following:\n\nTestplan with 3 JavaRequests with an own implementation of the\nAbstractJavaSamplerClient. I have overridden the getDefaultParameters() method.\nThis shows then all parameters in the Requests as well as in the request\nDefaults. My problem is now, that I would like to define all Parameters in the\nDefaults except one, which has to be defined in the concrete Request. All\nParameters are overridden from the Defaults (even if the parameter there is\nnull). Also, if I get rid of this one parameter in the defaults, and add them\nmanually to the Requests these are stored in the jmx-File but are never called\nagain. I therefore have to put all parameters in each Request :-(\n\nRegards,\n\nMarkus", "id": 52667, "time": "2004-02-20T15:17:31Z", "bug_id": 27114, "creation_time": "2004-02-20T15:17:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 27114, "is_private": false, "text": "Indeed it is (was) a bug - see bug 26605.
