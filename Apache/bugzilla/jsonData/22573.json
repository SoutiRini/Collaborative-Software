It's not possible to predict what response I receive next time: sometimes I receive \nmore than 10 \"1.1\" responses without a break, sometimes there are more than 10 \"1.0\" one after \nanother and sometimes they take turns. As I understand the difference is not just in minor version \nnumber in response, there are different headers.\n\nI have the following \nconfig:\n\nBrowserMatch \"MSIE\" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\nSetEnv \nnokeepalive 1\nSetEnv downgrade-1.0 1\nSetEnv force-response-1.0 1\n\nThese four derictives \nare in global section of config file. The last 3 are in order to show that the problem is not in \nBrowserMatch.\n\nHere are two examples of responses for the following request\n\nRequest\n-----------\n\n\nGET /cgi-bin/printenv HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/vnd.ms-excel, \napplication/msword, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*\nAccept-\nLanguage: ru\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE \n4.0; Windows 95) Opera\nHost: www:8101\n\nResponse 1:\n------------\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 20 \nAug 2003 06:45:23 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3.28 (Unix) PHP/4.2.2\nConnection: \nclose\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: \ntext/plain\n\n.....\ndowngrade_1_0=\"1\"\nforce_response_1_0=\"1\"\nnokeepalive=\"1\"\n\nResponse \n2:\n---------------------\n\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 20 Aug 2003 06:48:26 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3.28 (Unix) \nPHP/4.2.2\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: \ntext/plain\n\n....\ndowngrade_1_0=\"1\"\nforce_response_1_0=\"1\"\nnokeepalive=\"1\""}]
