Howerver on reading the FAQ on the HSSF I find it is not possible \nto protect the sheet because MS encrpyts the file, but fields can be  locked.\n  To circumvent this problem, I am using an blank excel file which is \nprotected, and using my program I am creating a copy of this file first and \nthen inserting values into this newly created file using POI. I find that I can \nacheive the desired results.\n  Since I plan to extensively use this, has any one used these technique \nbefore, and encountered any issuses.\n\nRegards,\nVikranth"}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18454, "text": "Join the mail list.
