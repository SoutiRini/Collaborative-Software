It just \ngives HTTP 404 errors saying the requested resource is not available. When I \nedited server.xml to change docbase=\"F:\\Tomcat\\webapps\\myProjects\" to \njust \"myProjects\" everything worked fine. Several folders created by Tomcat, \nincluding ROOT and tomcat-docs, also have absolute paths in server.xml and I \ncould not get the servlets to work in these folders either until I changed to \nrelative paths."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Please use the Tomact-User mailing list for questions like this.
