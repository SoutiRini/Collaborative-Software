Under 1.4.1 in my build file I use \n<echo>...</echo> tags to create a multiline help message and all works just \nfine.  However, under 1.5.3 this now creates [echo] tags on each line which in \nitself is not a big problem but id does make my output look ugly.  I can not \nsee any documentation that suggests this is intentional nor can I see any way \nof curbing this behaviour in the docs.  \n\nPlease could you advise what to do, and is this a bug or feature of 1.5.3.\n\nMany thanks.\nNaran Hirani."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18980, "attachment_id": null, "text": "It's a feature.
