The CVE and various advisories posted online are not very clear on the scope of this vulnerability. The CVE seems to suggest that the vulnerability manifests itself only when client cert authentication is used. However, other advisories suggest that this could happen even when client cert authentication is not involved, if the client or server requests a re-negotiate.\n\nMy first question is: Are Apache web servers 2.2.x with mod_ssl vulnerable to this issue if client certificate authetication is not used.\n\nMy second question is: 2.2 documentation refers to a new mod_ssl directive called SSLInsecureRenegotiation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslinsecurerenegotiation. The document mentions that this is only supported in 2.2.15 but I have not seen 2.2.15 being released. When would it be released?\n\n\nThanks", "id": 135083, "time": "2010-03-05T14:43:41Z", "bug_id": 48866, "creation_time": "2010-03-05T14:43:41Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 135085, "time": "2010-03-05T15:08:09Z", "bug_id": 48866, "creation_time": "2010-03-05T15:08:09Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum, this research discussion should be taken to the users mailing list.
