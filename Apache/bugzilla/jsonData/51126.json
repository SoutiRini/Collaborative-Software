[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 26938\nPatch against 2.2.x/docs/manual/mod\n\nThe current description reads:\n\n\"Usage is basically similar to ProxyPassReverse, but instead of rewriting headers that are a URL, this rewrites the path string in Set-Cookie headers.\"\n\nThis is misleading. \"Similar\" perhaps but significantly different. Consider this example:\n\nProxyPassReverseCookiePath / /apps\n\nThis does not prepend \"/apps\" to the cookie's path, according to my experiments; it replaces the path entirely with \"/apps\". It is not doing a match-and-replace like ProxyPassReverse; instead it replaces the path completely if it matches. This could be problematic if you have a lot of applications on the backend web server each wanting to preserve its own session cookie by setting a path. It would require a specific directive for each application e.g.\n \nProxyPassReverseCookiePath /app1 /apps/app1 \nProxyPassReverseCookiePath /app2 /apps/app2 ...\n\nI would go so far as to call this a bug; certainly I think it should work more like ProxyPassReverse. In the meantime, here's a suggested doc patch. This could apply to trunk docs as well; hopefully there might later be a fix such that it's not needed, however. I haven't tested against 2.0; it's probably the same.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 51126, "id": 146021, "time": "2011-04-27T16:53:50Z", "creator": "lmeyer@vmware.com", "creation_time": "2011-04-27T16:53:50Z", "attachment_id": 26938}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51126, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 151415, "time": "2011-11-11T17:11:47Z", "creator": "rbowen@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-11-11T17:11:47Z", "text": "Committed to 2.2 in r1200953.\nCommitted to trunk in r1200957"}]
