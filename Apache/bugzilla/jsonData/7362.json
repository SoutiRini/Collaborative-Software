Then the site sets its cookies but is\nunable to  verify them, thus not allowing access.\n\nI have to mention that this is not a CONNECT problem, as a secure login session\nto mail.yahoo.com (which uses only https for this purpose) succeedes.\n\nI solved this compiling the 1.3.22 sources in src/modules/proxy in 1.3.23 source\nenvironment. The module worked properly.\n\nI didn't test this on another OS.\n\n                    SLao"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7362, "text": "This is fixed in the release due out today.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 7195 ***", "id": 12180, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-03-22T15:22:01Z", "time": "2002-03-22T15:22:01Z", "is_private": false}]
