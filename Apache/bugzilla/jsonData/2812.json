The way I tested it out was as \nfollows:\n\n<project default=\"A\" >\n<target name=\"A\" >\n<copy file=\"doesnotexist.txt\" tofile=\"doesnotexist2.txt\" />\n<!-- both the above files do not exist -->\n</target>\n</project>\n\n\nand wrote a class that implemented the BuildListener interface.\nEven though the copy fails and I get the message\n\"Could not copy file doesnotexist.txt to doesnotexist2.txt\" from Ant,\nthe BuildEvent object passed to the taskFinished() method [ implemented\nin the BuildListener interface ] returns a null with getException()\n..Is this because a failed copy is _not_ an exception at all in Ant's mind\nor a bug so that setException() is not called before calling taskFinished() on \nan error?\n\nI hope I have made the problem clear.\nIf Ant is doing the \"right\" thing, let me know how I can accomplish \nthis 'task' :-) ?\n\n-Shankar"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2812, "text": "<copy> did not throw exceptions in 1.3 but it does in 1.4.
