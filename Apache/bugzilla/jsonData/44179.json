For example, if your\nSubversion server is configured to allow everyone to check out the repository\nover http:// or https://, but only allow commits to come in via https://, you\nhave an interesting problem on your hands. If your externals definitions use the\nhttp:// form of the repository URLs, you won't be able to commit anything from\nthe working copies created by those externals. On the other hand, if they use\nthe https:// form of the URLs, anyone who might be checking out via http://\nbecause their client doesn't support https:// will be unable to fetch the\nexternal items. Be aware, too, that if you need to re-parent your working copy\n(using svn switch --relocate), externals definitions will not also be re-parented.\"\n\nIt may be more appropriate if the externals definition was set to use\n\"http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/connectors/trunk/jni/native\".
