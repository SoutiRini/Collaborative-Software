Reading and writing back to a new xls doesn't work in 3.0.2\n\nI'd like to read a simple Excel file containing a dropdown list (data validation) and write it back into a new one. The whole thing worked with POI 3.0.1 but not in\nwith the new POI revision 3.0.2:\n\n1. Read a simple Excel-file with dropdown:\n\tInputStream input = MyClass.class.getResourceAsStream(\n\"simple_dropdown.xls\" );\n\tPOIFSFileSystem fs = new POIFSFileSystem( input );\n\tHSSFWorkbook wb = new HSSFWorkbook(fs);\n\n2. Write the Excel file into another file:\n\tFileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(\"output.xls\");\n\twb.write(out);\n\tout.close();\n\nNow, here's the thing:\n- My Excel file only contains a dropdown-list, no further special formatting or other stuff!\n- If i do the steps above with POI 3.0.1, the dropdown list still exists\nin the output file\n- If i do the exact same thing with POI 3.0.2, the dropdown is gone in the output-file. The cell only contains the value which was selected in the input file. The validation rule of the cell is also gone, it is set back to \"any value\".\n\nAm I doing anything wrong?\n\nMichael", "id": 114127, "time": "2008-02-29T05:46:59Z", "bug_id": 44510, "creation_time": "2008-02-29T05:46:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44510, "attachment_id": 21606, "text": "Created attachment 21606\nsvn diff of changes to DVALRecord", "id": 114146, "time": "2008-02-29T14:14:20Z", "creator": "josh@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-02-29T14:14:20Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44510, "attachment_id": 21607, "text": "Created attachment 21607\ntar bz2 of one added test class", "id": 114147, "time": "2008-02-29T14:15:42Z", "creator": "josh@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-02-29T14:15:42Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "josh@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "The problem was due to a combination of in-line field declaration/initialisations, and using the template pattern during instance initialization.
