What code? If you pass the home \ndirectory as an attribute to the WebSphere element you also don't have to \nrecompile the code.\n\nI just thought it might be more logical to set the home directory as an \nattribute of the websphere element. Since that is the normal way of passing \nvalues to an element instead of using properties.\n\nInstead of this:\n...\n<property name=\"websphere.home\" value=\"c:${file.separator}\nWebSphere${file.separator}AppServer\"/>\n...\n<target name=\"buildEJBWebSphere\">\n    ...\n    <websphere keepgeneric=\"true\" dbvendor=\"${server.ejb.dbvendor}\" \nejbdeploy=\"true\" oldCMP=\"false\" tempdir=\"${computer.temp}\" \ndestdir=\"${server.deploy.ejb}\" suffix=\"${server.deploy.ejb.suffix}\">\n      <wasclasspath refid=\"was.class.path\" />\n      <classpath refid=\"project.class.path\" />\n    </websphere>\n    ...\n</target>\n...\n\nyou would have something like this:\n...\n<target name=\"buildEJBWebSphere\">\n    ...\n    <websphere washome=\"c:${file.separator}WebSphere${file.separator}AppServer\" \nkeepgeneric=\"true\" dbvendor=\"${server.ejb.dbvendor}\" ejbdeploy=\"true\" \noldCMP=\"false\" tempdir=\"${computer.temp}\" destdir=\"${server.deploy.ejb}\" \nsuffix=\"${server.deploy.ejb.suffix}\">\n      <wasclasspath refid=\"was.class.path\" />\n      <classpath refid=\"project.class.path\" />\n    </websphere>\n    ...\n</target>\n...\n\n\nAlso, if the websphere home directory has to be set by using a property, it \nshould at least be mentioned in the documentation. Because now the only way of \nknowing you have to set that property, is by looking in the source code of ANT.\n(or I overlooked something)", "id": 18076, "time": "2002-06-19T14:52:02Z", "creator": "Geroen.dierckx@eds.com", "creation_time": "2002-06-19T14:52:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
