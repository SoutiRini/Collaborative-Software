I posted to tomcat-user and some people on the list told me to\nfile a bug.\n\nI've been using Tomcat 4.0.6 for some time now, because neither 4.1.12 nor\n4.1.18 handled my Unicode correctly.\n\nWhen 4.1.18 came out, my co-worker Paul Caton posted to tomcat-user asking for\nhelp on this issue. I had supposed by now the issue would have been solved, so I\ncheerily and with much anticipation installed 4.1.24.\n\nHowever, the unicode handling is still bad in 4.1.24, so we are sticking with\n4.0.6.  We're wondering if this issue is going to be addressed in future releases.\n\nI am willing to send the actual URLs of the tomcat servers on which the test\ndocuments reside to any developer who wants them, but I'd rather not post those\nURLs to the public at large. I can also send any jsp code, xsl stylesheets,\nXinclude stuff, etc.\n\nIn lieu of that here, I'll just give the URLs of two comparative screenshots to\nshow the differences in the Unicode handling:\n\nbad: http://dev.stg.brown.edu/screenshots/acsam-4.1.24.jpg\ngood: http://dev.stg.brown.edu/screenshots/acsam-4.0.6.jpg\n\nThank you very much,\n\n-carole"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This works for me with a basic test jsp.
