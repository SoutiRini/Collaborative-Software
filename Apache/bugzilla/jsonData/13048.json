I \ncreated a testcase that validated that it did not work.  I have since fixed \nit.  However, I also added another feature as well.  I added a parameter \ncontainsAll that allows you to either specify that a line must contain ALL of \nthe values, or it can contain ANY of the values.  By default for backward \ncomptablity it is optional and true.  \n\nThe new testcase for LineContains and the patched line contains I'll attache.  \nAfter I spent time adding the containsAll option, it turned out I didn't need \nit.  so if the committers don't want the linecontains containsAll option, it \ncan be removed easily.\n\nEric Pugh", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13048, "attachment_id": 3250, "id": 23480, "time": "2002-09-26T21:21:54Z", "creator": "epugh@upstate.com", "creation_time": "2002-09-26T21:21:54Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 3250\nPatch file for Testcases and LineContains"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "epugh@upstate.com", "attachment_id": 3251, "is_private": false, "id": 23482, "time": "2002-09-26T21:24:08Z", "bug_id": 13048, "creation_time": "2002-09-26T21:24:08Z", "text": "Created attachment 3251\nZip of files for Testcases"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13048, "text": "I've committed part of your patch to CVS HEAD (and will commit it to the branch\nleading to 1.5.1 shortly) - linecontains should now work.\n\nI'm degrading the containsall part of your patch to enhancement.\n\nThanks.", "id": 23639, "time": "2002-09-30T12:10:45Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-09-30T12:10:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13048, "text": "It already has been fixed for 1.5.1 as part of the fix for Bug 9762, just not\nbeing merged into the main branch.", "id": 23640, "time": "2002-09-30T12:29:23Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-09-30T12:29:23Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "jan@materne.de", "is_private": false, "id": 183442, "creation_time": "2015-06-10T20:04:44Z", "time": "2015-06-10T20:04:44Z", "bug_id": 13048, "text": "This is not in the 1.9.6 codebase.\nShould be integrate that?", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13048, "text": "What went into 1.5 in order to fix this was https://github.com/apache/ant/commit/106185e44b48def793968eb9cab1ecc5ee085e3f#diff-96b58c2ec6649c0b21f33ce48d71c120 - the master branch version of which is https://github.com/apache/ant/commit/6a012bdb4cf3d536421a4fcc996e9427842df8d6#diff-96b58c2ec6649c0b21f33ce48d71c120 - so this should be fixed since about thirteen years. :-)", "id": 183473, "time": "2015-06-12T04:22:22Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-06-12T04:22:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
