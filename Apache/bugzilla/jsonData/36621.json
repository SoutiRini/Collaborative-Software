Assuming that you configure Slide to use a\nJ2EE datasource with value \"jdbc/SlideDS\", Slide will try to lookup the\nDataSource at \"java:env/core/jdbc/SlideDS\".  SJAS 8.1 appears to place the JNDI\nDataSources in the root context, so specifying \"jdbc/SlideDS\" in the Domain.xml\non SJAS should point to the \"jdbc/SlideDS\" resource.  I worked around this by\nchanging J2EEStore::initialize() method to look up the datasource in the root\ncontext, and everything seems to work fine.\n\nI suggest that Slide look up the DataSource in the root context by default. \nUsers will specify the full path to the DataSource in the Domain.xml file."}]
