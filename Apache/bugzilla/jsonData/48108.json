You will need to select a font that has the glyphs you need. That '~' is not available is a little peculiar. That glyph is available in almost all latin fonts. However the arrow glyph is not. Maybe if you mentioned what fonts you're trying to use, it would be easier to tell exactly what's going on.\n\nPlease follow up on fop-users@xmlgraphics.apache.org.
