The bug needs further investigation, as it's currently unclear where mod_WebObjects get's the length from and whos responsibility it is to set it. However, i currently have no sponsor for that work, so i hope someone will pick it up.\n\n\n[1] httpd-2.2.15-30.el6.centos.x86_64\n[2] https://github.com/wocommunity/wonder.git", "id": 176920, "time": "2014-08-05T12:38:31Z", "bug_id": 56818, "creation_time": "2014-08-05T12:38:31Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56818, "text": "There is no separate length.
