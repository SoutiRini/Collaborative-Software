I\u2019ve been using Apache POI for a number of years. I\u2019m now learning the Event API for reading XLSX files.\n\nI think I found a small bug on the example:\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/xssf/eventusermodel/examples/FromHowTo.java\n\nThe example throws an Exception when reading a small xlsx file with the following contents:\n\n+-----+-----+\n|  A  |  1  |\n+-----+-----+\n|  B  |  2  |\n+-----+-----+\n\nI\u2019ve fixed with just adding a line.\n\nSorry if the patch attachment isn't in the right format.
