Is the test setup this.\n\n1. you have a webservice test plan that uses the webservice sampler\n2. you're using multiple systems to do remote testing\n\nIs that accurate. I should warn you that webservices scale horribly with respect\nto concurrent load. If the xml parser your application is using is slow and eats\na ton of RAM, it's going to be hard to handle 20 concurrent webservice requests\non a 2.4ghz P4 system or 2ghz althon system.  This is from benchmarking with IIS\n+ .NET and crimson for Java with tomcat.\n\nwith just one system, you can easily overload a webservice on the serverside.\nespecially if the webservice is making a call to a remote database and doing\nreal work.\n\npeter", "id": 72584, "time": "2005-03-17T14:15:47Z", "creator": "woolfel@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2005-03-17T14:15:47Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 34052, "is_private": false, "id": 74604, "time": "2005-05-09T02:32:04Z", "creator": "woolfel@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2005-05-09T02:32:04Z", "tags": [], "text": "More information is needed to figure out exactly the cause."}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 34052, "is_private": false, "id": 89738, "time": "2006-06-04T01:03:21Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-06-04T01:03:21Z", "tags": [], "text": "Not enough information to be able to fix"}]
