See the file README-MAVEN.txt there for configuration and usage information.\n\nOnce downloaded to your home directory, this patch may be applied as follows:\n\ncd ${FOP}/trunk\ngzcat ~/patch-maven-build.diff.gz | patch -p0\nsvn add maven\n\nNote that only the core fop.jar artifact is built at this time. In particular, the fop-transcoder and fop-sandbox jar artifacts are not yet built.\n\nThis patch has been verified against repository version 992575.\n\nRegards,\nGlenn"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "Created attachment 25986\nPatch to add maven build support.\n\nThis patch has been verified against repository version 992575.", "id": 139687, "time": "2010-09-04T06:42:53Z", "bug_id": 49881, "creation_time": "2010-09-04T06:42:53Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25986}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "lack of consensus for committing patch; reconsider this addition in the future", "id": 157246, "time": "2012-04-06T23:40:03Z", "bug_id": 49881, "creation_time": "2012-04-06T23:40:03Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "batch transition resolved+later to closed+later; if you have new information or a patch that addresses the issue, you may reopen", "id": 158650, "time": "2012-04-30T00:25:04Z", "bug_id": 49881, "creation_time": "2012-04-30T00:25:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
