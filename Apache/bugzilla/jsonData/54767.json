To transform the dates to numbers we use the method org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.DateUtil.getExcelDate(Calendar date, boolean use1904windowing) and pass in a calendar that is set in UTC.\n\nAm I missing something? Can I change the timezone of the internal Calendar or am I doing something wrong? Is it possible to expose the timezone settings of said calendar instead of using the default one?", "id": 166228, "time": "2013-03-29T13:08:37Z", "creator": "i8c.alex@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-03-29T13:08:37Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54767, "attachment_id": null, "id": 166229, "time": "2013-03-29T13:17:06Z", "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "creation_time": "2013-03-29T13:17:06Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please ask usage questions on the mailing lists - http://poi.apache.org/mailinglists.html"}]
