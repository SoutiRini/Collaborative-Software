This\nconfiguration doesn't seem to work under 2.0.35.\n\nOn my configuration, SSL virtual hosts work fine, and both forward and reverse\nproxy virtual hosts work fine when they are not SSL. An SSL virtual host with a\nreverse proxy, however, connects (verified using openssl's s_client command),\nbut never responds. Commenting out the reverse proxy lines on that exact virtual\nhost causes the default apache HTML pages to come up, so the SSL isn't the problem.\n\nAlso, the remote server does see the socket opened by the proxy, but does not\nreceive any data.
