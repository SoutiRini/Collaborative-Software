[{"count": 0, "text": "Applying changes to a testplan should be consistantly done across the interface.\nThere seems to be 2 distinct times where it applies changes. \n\nThe first is like in the arguments of an IF contoller, when I change the data it\nis automanically applied to the testplan if I make a mistake there is no turning\nback. This is the type I perfer because it is most like other applications. \n\nThe second is similar to HTML call parameters in where if I do not press return\nthe change is not made. This is annoying because if I am changing several calls\nthen I may just click on each one with the mouse changing them and not pressing\nthe return key expecting the fact I changed the value to be reflected in the\ntestcase.
