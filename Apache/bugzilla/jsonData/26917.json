[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 26917, "attachment_id": null, "text": "I downloaded the jakarta-tomcat-5.0.18 binary from the Jakarta site and \ninstalled it on our AIX platform.  I am able to load the home page \n($CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/index.jsp) without any problem.  I can also load \nall the Tomcat-Documentation pages (tomcat-docs) without problem.  I cannot \nload the jsp-examples or servlets-examples pages however.  The manager page \nshows both to be not running.  When I attempt to start either I get an error.  \nFor example, trying to deploy jsp-examples results in the following error:\n\nFAIL - Application at context path /jsp-examples could not be started\n\nThe catalina.out log shows the following:\n\n[INFO] StandardHostDeployer - -standardHost.start /jsp-examples\n[ERROR] Context - -Error filterStart\n[ERROR] Context - -Context startup failed due to previous errors\n\nI even re-installed tomcat but that didn't help.  Can someone please tell me \nwhat is missing.  I can stop and start the tomcat-docs just fine.\n\nNote:  The jsp-examples and servlets-examples files are installed at the same \nlevel as tomcat-docs (standard installation).", "id": 52249, "time": "2004-02-13T16:37:04Z", "creator": "doug.parisek@bull.com", "creation_time": "2004-02-13T16:37:04Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "text": "Please use the tomcat-user list to debug this first.", "id": 52250, "time": "2004-02-13T16:40:18Z", "bug_id": 26917, "creation_time": "2004-02-13T16:40:18Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
