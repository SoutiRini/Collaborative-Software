I have used Apache previously and\nnever had this problem.\n\nWhen I manually edit the httpd.conf file, specifically the DocuemntRoot\ndirective, and restart the server, I get this error:\n\nhttpd failed. The error was: Starting httpd: Syntax error on line 361 of\n/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:\nDocumentRoot must be a directory\n[FAILED]\n\nI restart the server from within the Service Configuration app provided by Fedora.\n\nHere is what I set my DocumentRoot to:\n\nDocumentRoot /home/vadtec/website\n\nI have tried this as well:\n\nDocumentRoot \"/home/vadtec/website\"\nDocumentRoot \"/home/vadtec/website/\"\nDocumentRoot /home/vadtec/website/\n\nNone of them work. I know that this is an actuall directory. (It's not rocket\nscience.) However, if I set the DocumentRoot to be /var/www/html, in any of the\nforms above, it works just fine.\n\nI run Apahce as apache with a group of apache. My ServerRoot is /etc/httpd and\nthat is where all my config files are kept. Plain vanilla for the most part. As\nwell, when I do set the DocumentRoot to /var/www/html and define a virtual host\nwith a different DocumentRoot (not VirtualDocumentRoot), I get this when I try\nto view the virtual host (setup on 127.0.0.2:80):\n\nForbidden\n\nYou don't have permission to access / on this server.\n\nAdditionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use an\nErrorDocument to handle the request.\nApache/2.0.52 (Fedora) Server at localhost Port 80\n\nThe DocumentRoot for the virtual host is /home/vadtec/website.\n\nI found one other reference to this bug, but it is for Windows (Bug # 33781).\n\nI have never had this kind of problem, and its getting rather annoying. I have\nnot been able to reproduce this error on my web hosting company's server, but I\ndont get to edit the config file directly anyways.
