I\npoked and prodded, did some reinstallation, tried different things, and suddenly\nit worked, without my being able to explain why.  It worked for a couple of\ndays.  I made the mistake of hitting the \"close\" button on the DOS box JMeter\nwas running in, which also took down the GUI window I had test results displayed\nin.  When I tried to run JMeter again, the error (above) had returned.  I've\nreinstalled Java (JDK and JRE), and JMeter, and this problem won't go away.\n\nThe error message is **TOTALLY** meaningless:  What is failing?  Why?  I've got\nmore than 30 years of programming experience, and this stack dump leaves me\ncompletely baffled!\n\nSummary of what I've done:\n\nbrand new development system, Sony Vaio VGN-BX660P 1GB RAM Intel Core2 1.82GHz\ninstalled WAMP 1.7.2\n...\ninstalled jdk-6u2-windows-i586-p.exe JDK 6 Update 2: jdk1.6.0_02, jre1.6.0_02\nJAVA_HOME=C:\\Programs\\Java\\jre1.6.0_02 (manually set: not done by any\ninstallation programs; no spaces in path)\n\nI tried to figure out what was meant in the \"2.3 Installation\" section of\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/usermanual/get-started.html where it says\n\"simply unzip the zip/tar file into the directory where you want JMeter to be\ninstalled\" and first unzipped the archive into a temporary directory, then\ncopied the contents of the bin, etc. directories to the corresponding JRE ones\n(since that's where I'd set JAVA_HOME to be).\n\nOnce I figured out where jmeter.bat was, I opened a DOS box in that directory\nand tried running \"jmeter\" - which returned the error output illustrated at the\ntop of this bug report.  As indicated above, I tried hacking at the problem,\nreinstalling stuff, rebooting, reinstalling more - and suddenly it started\nworking, for reasons unknown.\n\nWhen the bug returned, I tried reinstalling Java, discovered there were at least\ntwo copies on the machine, and deinstalled both Java and JMeter.  In doing the\nreinstall, I put Java back in the same place I'd had it before, and unpacked\nJMeter into a separate directory, so its files are no longer mixed in with the\nJRE ones.  I'm still getting the same error, and cannot proceed with *ANY* testing.", "id": 106492, "time": "2007-08-08T12:11:05Z", "creator": "asfbugzilla.db@wfredk.com", "creation_time": "2007-08-08T12:11:05Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "asfbugzilla.db@wfredk.com", "is_private": false, "id": 106493, "time": "2007-08-08T12:15:19Z", "bug_id": 43063, "creation_time": "2007-08-08T12:15:19Z", "tags": [], "text": "C:\\Programs\\Java\\JAKART~1.3RC\\bin > jmeter\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/jorphan/ut\nil/JMeterException\n        at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredConstructors0(Native Method)\n        at java.lang.Class.privateGetDeclaredConstructors(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.Class.getConstructor0(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Unknown Source)\n        at org.apache.jmeter.NewDriver.main(NewDriver.java:181)\n\nWed 08/08/2007 15:12:38.48 Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]\n\nI had thought that setting the DOS window width to more than 80 characters would\ncause the first line to not wrap.
