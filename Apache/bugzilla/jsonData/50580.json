It is easy to use, you just put the data in a text area, then it will loop that data in the tests. In addition, you don't need to put the files on all nodes when doing distributed testing, which was a showstopper for me. \n\nI know you have a distributed file server in the pipe, but I think this element has its own merits.\n\nI hope you'll like it. I'll be happy to hear from you, with any feedback.\n\nBTW: My current assignment employer (I'm a consultant) would be happy if their name could appear somewhere. Is that possible? \n\nCheers\nDaniel"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "daniel.brolund@agical.com", "text": "Created attachment 26486\nPatch for TabularDataSet element NEW VERSION\n\nI had a off-by-one error for the iteration counter that starts on 1 and not on 0.", "id": 143323, "time": "2011-01-13T07:58:43Z", "bug_id": 50580, "creation_time": "2011-01-13T07:58:43Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 26486}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "milamber@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for your submission.
