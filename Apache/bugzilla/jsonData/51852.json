However I continue to get the error even when dropping JUEL from the application, so I'm not sure why in some instances the Jasper implementation seems to handle the varargs invocations and in others the BeanELResolver is invoked.  In any event, code that already resides in BeanELResolver should certainly function properly, and mixing a given ExpressionFactory implementation with any conforming API implementation should AFAICT be feasible.\n\nThe second issue I encountered while debugging the first issue."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51852, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 27543\nProposed patch\n\nI grant the ASF license to incorporate the contents of the submitted patch.", "id": 149535, "time": "2011-09-20T19:17:16Z", "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-09-20T19:17:16Z", "attachment_id": 27543}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51852, "is_private": false, "text": "Many thanks for the patch and especially for including the test case.\n\nThe patch has been applied to trunk and 7.0.x and will be included in 7.0.22 onwards.", "id": 149590, "time": "2011-09-21T13:41:56Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-09-21T13:41:56Z", "attachment_id": null}]
