See TITLE of spanish (es) translations. \n\nIs '&excl;' really an acknowledged name for representing a '!' (i.e. &#033;)?\n\nOther languages use the exclamation mark '!' explicitly in their translations,\ne.g. german, french, swedish, etc.\n\nTherefore an explicit exclamation mark '!' should be fine for spanish too.\n\nBest Regards,\nRolf Sponsel"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "text": "Thanks :-)\n\n&excl; is not defined by the W3C, so I've just replaced it by !.", "id": 56032, "time": "2004-04-19T17:09:01Z", "bug_id": 28459, "creation_time": "2004-04-19T17:09:01Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "Rolf.Sponsel@kstr.lth.se", "attachment_id": null, "text": "As we dealing with these things; there is actually another related issue.\n\nI'm not sure if it's a Mozilla only thingie though, or if it's a general one.\nTheses spanish sentences - of course - use have the inverted exclamationmark\n(i.e. an '!' upside down), in these files represented by '&iexcl;'.
