Typically they are checked and if a value outside the spec is\nencountered a suitable error is raised, e.g. font-stretch has the allowed values\n\"normal | wider | narrower | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed |\nsemi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded | ultra-expanded |\ninherit\" and if anything else is put into the property value the user will get\nan error. However, I noticed that this is not the case for font-style whose\nallowed values are \"normal | italic | oblique | backslant | inherit\" or\nfont-weight (allowed values: \"normal | bold | bolder | lighter | 100 | 200 | 300\n| 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900 | inherit\").
