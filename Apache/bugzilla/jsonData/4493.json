When the mailer.jar file is in the webapp/WEB-\nINF/lib directory and one of the other two is in the TOMCAT_HOME/lib directory, \nI get an error when trying to use the mailer tag library, whcih is a known \nJavaMail error that indicates that either the mail.jar file or the \nactivation.jar file is not in the classpath.\n\nAdditionally, when I try to load a properties file using a ClassLoader from a \nclass in the TOMCAT_HOME/lib directory and the properties file is located in \nthe classes directory of the webapp, it cannot find the properties file.\n\nMy configuration is one where many class files are located in the \nTOMCAT_HOME/lib directory and then I have about 10 or so virtual hosts with \nwebapps located at the root level of each host.", "id": 7259, "time": "2001-10-29T08:00:06Z", "creator": "gabe@groundzero.com", "creation_time": "2001-10-29T08:00:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "This isn't so much a bug as a feature.
