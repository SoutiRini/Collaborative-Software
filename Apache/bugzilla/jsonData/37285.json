[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "If an XML document is posted through CGI the CGIServlet is prepending the \ncontent with the query parameters from the URL.  Since the content is expected \nto be well formed XML (as specified by specifying \"Content-Type: text/xml\") the \nprepended query parameters cause the XML parsing to fail.  Assuming a test.sh \nscript has been configured for Tomcat which contains:\n\n  java test <&0 >test.out\n\nwhere test.java simply echoes the input (there is probably an easier way to do \nthis) as follows:\n\n  public class test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n      try {\n        int c = System.in.read();\n        while(c > 0) {\n          System.out.print((char)c);\n          c = System.in.read();\n        }\n      } catch(Exception e) {e.printStackTrace();}\n    }\n  }\n\nThen exercise the Tomcat server by launching a telnet session for the Tomcat \nhost and port, such as \"telnet localhost 8080\", and enter the following:\n\n  POST /test/cgi-bin/test.sh?a=123&b=xyz HTTP/1.1\n  Host: localhost:8080\n  Content-type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8\n  Content-length: 250\n  Connection: close\n\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n  <Root>\n  <Date>2005-10-27 00:00:00</Date>\n  </Root>\n\nThe resulting test.out file will contain the submitted XML document prepended \nwith a line containing the query parameters (a=123&b=xyz).  Unfortunately the \nXML parser that is recieving this data is expecting XML data and the query \nparameters cause an exception (since they are invalid XML).

This act will likely drain the stdin \nand lose whatever original content was there.\n\nAdditionally, the parameters parsed from the GET QUERY_STRING are thrown into \nthe getParameterNames mix.\n\n\nIn run(), when POST is observed, \n1. stdin is read into a buffer named content.  I speculated stdin is pre-\ndrained if content type is urlencoded.\n2. the HttpServlet parameters are written to the stream (S) that will be the \ncgis stdin.\n3. the 'content' buffer is appended to S {buffer is empty if urlencoded and the \nwhole thing if multipart form}\n\nOne problem I see is that content length is not increased when content buffer \nis written.  Maybe it gets measured elsewhere?\n\nMy original foray into this bug is due to that fact I am deploying a cgi app \n(YaBB) that does not use standard parameter separators -- it's legacy nature \nhas parameters being separated by & or ; .\n\nThe cgi app was not getting the parameters it needed because HttpServlet \nencoded or escaped the semis and subsequent equals to their equivalent %{nn} \nforms.
