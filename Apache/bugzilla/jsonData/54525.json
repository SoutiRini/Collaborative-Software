This process works but it's slow and it would be a substantial enhancement if this were possible in the GUI - maybe via the Seach menu. It would be an even greater enhancement if there were a button available on the User Defined Variables form that would allow me to directly:\n\n\"Find any occurrences of the [MYVALUE] string and replace with '${[MYVARNAME]}'\".\n\nThe added benefit here is saving the time, risk and effort of having to go through the plan and complete this process manually. \n\nIt's worth noting that in pretty much every single case where a var is created then this find and replace action is required, so it may as well be made easier.\n\nRelates to https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22076.", "id": 165078, "time": "2013-02-05T13:34:23Z", "bug_id": 54525, "creation_time": "2013-02-05T13:34:23Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54525, "text": "Created attachment 34541\nPatch implementing the replace for Samplers\n\nHello,\nThis is a first step to replace feature.\n\nCurrent patch has one bug for now that I didn't resolve yet (ideas welcome).\nBug is : If a sampler that contains a value to be replaced, the replacement does not occur although the underlying sampler has been.
