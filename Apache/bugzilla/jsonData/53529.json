There was scope to remove some unnecessary code and improve some log messages a little which is the only reason this wasn't closed as invalid. I have said this before and I'll say it again. Before reporting something as a bug because it looks like a typical bug pattern, please do the Tomcat committers the courtesy of actually analyzing the code to see if there really is a problem. \n\nThe only issue that came close to the original bug report was:\norg\\apache\\catalina\\tribes\\group\\interceptors\\NonBlockingCoordinator.java\nline 228\nFor this issue there was a marginal benefit to re-setting the interrupt flag and clearing it later as it allowed a specific error message to be generated in the unlikely event that there was an interrupt. This has been fixed in trunk (for 8.0.x) and I see no need to back-port the change.\n\nThe following were all unnecessary attempts to clear the interrupt flag and continue. The attempt is unnecessary since throwing InterruptedException clears the interrupt flag. I have fixed these in trunk but I see no need to back-port the changes.\norg\\apache\\catalina\\tribes\\group\\GroupChannel.java\nline 692\norg\\apache\\catalina\\tribes\\group\\interceptors\\TcpPingInterceptor.java\nline 173\norg\\apache\\juli\\AsyncFileHandler.java\nline 124\nline 146\norg\\apache\\tomcat\\util\\net\\AprEndpoint.java\nline 640\norg\\apache\\tomcat\\util\\net\\NioBlockingSelector.java\nline 112\nline 177\norg\\apache\\tomcat\\util\\threads\\ThreadPoolExecutor.java\nline 187\n\nThe following was an unnecessary attempt to catch InterruptedException when it is not thrown.
