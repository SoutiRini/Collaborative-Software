Each \nuser is seeing the results of the other user. We have generated a random \nparameter for each request to place on the url to try to counter these proxy \nissues, however the issue seems to be in tomcat's (or possibily Apache's as we \nare using a Apache/Tomcat worker setup) session indentification. A problem that \nhas emerged resently from this is SOME (not all) of a session's objects (JAVA \nBeans) are been invalidated, while others are not. An example of this is our \nDBManager which uses a predefined and created MaxID class.. This maxID class \nhas been invalidated, however the DBManager was not. These are both declared on \nevery page by use of a header.jsp which is included.\n\nThis may not be a bug, although I have been looking at the problem on and off \nfor a month and can't seem to find any information on the issue, or resolve the \norigin of issue.", "id": 48131, "time": "2003-11-26T01:14:10Z", "creator": "narcher@jspwebtech.com", "creation_time": "2003-11-26T01:14:10Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24998, "text": "With the information I have to go on, this looks like the standard 3.3.1 \nsession bug.
