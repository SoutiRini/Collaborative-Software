[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "As of the 1.3.26 build of Apache, old-style/incorrect GET requests no longer \nwork (they have worked in all previous builds of Apache).  I believe this is due \nto a GET syntax checking routine Martin added in 1.3.26.\n\nTO SEE HOW IT WORKED BEFORE:\n1) 'telnet dq.com 80' and enter 'GET /index.html HTTP-1.0' and press return \ntwice.\n2) Apache 1.3.25 ignores/handles the hyphen and still gets the file.\n\nTO SEE HOW IT NO LONGER WORKS:\n1) 'telnet axxs.net 80' and enter 'GET /index.html HTTP-1.0' and press return \ntwice.\n2) Apache 1.3.26 gives a 400 Bad Request result and does not get the file.\n\nWHY APACHE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS BAD SYNTAX:\nMany early socket and HTTP tutorials and books incorrectly show the hyphen \ninstead of a slash in the GET request and as a result, many programs, including \nours, use this old/incorrect syntax to retrieve updates, news, etc.\n\nYou would correctly argue that we should fix this on our end, which we already \nhave done.  However, there are already 50,000 some odd players with our online \ngames out there that can no longer get news, updates, alerts, etc. from our Web \nsite using Apache.  To make matters worse, we cant simply redirect the files \nsince the requests fail immediately, the only solution for us is to switch to a \nM$ server or a down-level Apache build with the security hole.  Please help us \nand others by maintaining your backward compatibility.\n\nI thank you for your time and support of Apache.
