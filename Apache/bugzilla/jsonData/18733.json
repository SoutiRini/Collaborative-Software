[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18733, "text": "I want to suggest that you create a separate framework for passing parameters \nto Java application programs based on ANT syntax.  ANT resolved the parameter \npassing to Java applications with tasks. The framework that I am suggesting \nwould allow Java programmers to use the same syntax to get complex parameters \nfrom a text file.  The ANT task syntax would be used in the text file.  \n\nI want to stress that the new framework would be independent of ANT.  It would \nsimply give users an additional way to retrieve data from text files.  The path \nlike structures would be particularly useful.\n\nThe parameter passing framework should complement the Jakarta CLI framework for \ncommand-line parameter retrieval.\n\nRegards,\nColbert Philippe", "id": 34576, "time": "2003-04-05T14:30:27Z", "creator": "cp1965@ROGERS.com", "creation_time": "2003-04-05T14:30:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18733, "attachment_id": null, "id": 53861, "time": "2004-03-11T12:02:47Z", "creator": "peter.reilly@corvil.com", "creation_time": "2004-03-11T12:02:47Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The description says that this is \"independent\" of Ant.\nMarking as WONTFIX."}]
