That would usually \nbe \"Times New Roman\" (for windows systems). Basicly, you could accomplish \nspecifying the exact font you want to use, so that the FancyIndexing looks \ncloser to what it was before.\n\nNOTE: Support for CSS for HTMLTables is a new feature on Apache 2.2.x\n\nPS: Would it be possible for such feature to be added on future versions of \nApache 2.0.x ?\n", "is_private": false, "id": 84960, "creator": "josestefan@hotmail.com", "time": "2006-01-24T21:31:19Z", "bug_id": 38180, "creation_time": "2006-01-24T21:31:19Z", "attachment_id": null}]
