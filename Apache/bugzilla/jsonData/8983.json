When \nyou say \"The problem has nothing to do with whether value is a CDATA,\", I don't \nunderstand.\n\nFrom my perspective, a percent sign should be a valid character in a <jsp:param> \nvalue, because the spec specifically indicates that values are of type CDTATA.  \nIf your implementation of the spec (i.e. Jasper) fails to properly encode the \nvalues before sending them to the destination servlet, then that's fine.  But \nthe way I read the spec, that is a bug in your code, and it's a bug BECAUSE the \nvalue are allowed to be of type CDATA.\n\nOr am I misunderstanding the spec completely?  Can you please clarify? Thanks.\n\nJay"}]
