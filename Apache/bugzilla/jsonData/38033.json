[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "This patch to rotatelogs adds a `-c' option which causes rotatelogs to \nautomatically create a `logfile.current' symlink pointing to the most recent \nlogfile. This is convenient when using a tail(1) that understands reopened \nfiles.\n\nAs a side effect I changed option parsing to use apr_getopt. Hope I got that \npart right. One potential caveat is that the current patch unlinks `logfile.\ncurrent' even if -c is not specified. This way at least a stale symlink will be \ncleaned up but it does incur an obvious risk for people unaware of the feature.\n\nAs an aside: I tried subscribing to dev@ but I got the following bounce message:\n\n552 spam score (6.1) exceeded threshold\n\nThe original message was:\n\nReturn-Path: <jos@catnook.com>                                                  \nReceived: (qmail 26229 invoked by uid 1000); 23 Dec 2005 08:33:44 -0000         \nDate: 23 Dec 2005 08:33:44 -0000                                                \nMessage-ID: <20051223083344.26228.qmail@lizzy.catnook.local>                    \nFrom: \"Jos Backus\" <jos@catnook.com>                                            \nTo: dev-subscribe@httpd.apache.org                                              \nReply-To: jos@catnook.com\n\nJos", "is_private": false, "id": 83970, "creation_time": "2005-12-24T03:00:09Z", "time": "2005-12-24T03:00:09Z", "creator": "jos@catnook.com", "bug_id": 38033, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jos@catnook.com", "text": "Created attachment 17273\nPatch to implement `rotatelogs -c' functionality", "id": 83971, "time": "2005-12-24T03:00:58Z", "bug_id": 38033, "creation_time": "2005-12-24T03:00:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 17273}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38033, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 83975, "time": "2005-12-24T14:05:51Z", "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "creation_time": "2005-12-24T14:05:51Z", "text": "Looks more like an enhancement request than a bug.
