If the text is complex or the cannot be translated\n * into a simple drawString the StrokingTextPainter is used instead.\n\nHowever,\nThe check for unsupported glyphs seems always to use the default font,\nWhen makeFont is called the ACI should be initialized(?) using aci.first(),\notherwise the position is undefined, the attributes (including font)\nare therefore null, and the default font is used instead.\n\nThis bug seems to be masked in my case since the embedded SVG document I am\nrendering has other unsupported attributes so the text has to be stroked\nanyway. However, in the course of debugging I came across this and thought\nI should mention it.\n\nCould someone who understands this font handling see if this patch is\nreasonable:\n\n\nacro"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "peter.wainwright@ieee.org", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 18877\nInitialize aci before makeFont etc. Otherwise it doesn't work.", "id": 93680, "time": "2006-09-17T09:30:30Z", "bug_id": 40529, "creation_time": "2006-09-17T09:30:30Z", "attachment_id": 18877}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40529, "attachment_id": null, "id": 126114, "time": "2009-04-08T12:43:33Z", "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-04-08T12:43:33Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This should be obsoleted by bug #47000.
