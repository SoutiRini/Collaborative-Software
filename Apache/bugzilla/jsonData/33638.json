I recon this is due to the fact that 'space' is used as the module-\nseperator, but this i quite unfortunate since cvsnt supports modulenames \ncontaining spaces.\n\nI've identified the CvsTagDiff-task-class and it appears that it make use of \nthe StringTokenizer for parsing the list of modules in the package-attribute. \nI suggest using another delimeter than the default, eg. semicolon. I have \nsuccesfully tried this modification of Ant 1.6.2.\n\nUnfortunately this change would break with existing ant-scripts, and thus \nanother solution could be to introduce a nested element, call it eg. \"package\" \nor \"module\", allowing a user to specify multiple cvs-modules to be included in \nthe task. Hereby we both preserve backward compatibility and introduce support \nfor exotic csv-module-names."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33638, "attachment_id": null, "id": 112955, "time": "2008-01-17T08:28:41Z", "creator": "andrey.ponomarev@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-01-17T08:28:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "The same problem appears using ant 1.7.0 on Linux"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33638, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 121594, "time": "2008-10-16T05:08:34Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-10-16T05:08:34Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 38220 ***"}]
