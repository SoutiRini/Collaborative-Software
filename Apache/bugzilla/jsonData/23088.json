Create a new Web Application whose Context Listener class calls a class that \nextends Thread and call that object.start().\n\n2. Now from manager if you stop the web application the web app is stopped from \nrunning apps but the Thread that is started will be running continuously when \nthere is an infinite loop in the run method of the Thread class.\n\n3. I think from ClassLoader we an get hold of the ThreadGroup and then we can \nstop all the threads associated with the ThreadGroup when stopping the web app.\n\nI may be wrong but if you think this is an Issue you can enter else just leave \nit.\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything.\n\nThanks and Regards,\n\nVijaya K Mantha.", "id": 44003, "time": "2003-09-10T22:03:16Z", "creator": "manthavk@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2003-09-10T22:03:16Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23088, "attachment_id": null, "text": "If somone configures a context listener which starts a background thread\nthen they are responsible for how that thread performs and for removing\nit when the webapp is stopped.
