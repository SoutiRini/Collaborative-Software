[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 46578, "text": "The header file ap_config_auto.h is a bit flawed. It defines PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION, and similar constants. If one would like to compile their own module, one could write something like:\n\n#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H\n#include <config.h>\n#endif\n#include <httpd.h>\n#include <http_config.h>\n#include <http_protocol.h>\n#include <ap_config.h>\n\nThis would give compiler warnings (not errors) about PACKAGE_NAME being re-defined. This is a bit sloppy and certainly not necessary. Hardly any C program defines PACKAGE_NAME and similar constants outside config.h, and header files should certainly not re-define them.\n\nIt would be better to have this in ap_config_auto.h:\n\n#ifndef PACKAGE_BUGREPORT\n# define PACKAGE_BUGREPORT \"\"\n#endif\n\nSo it's not very critical, but it's also not nice to cause warnings that need not be caused.", "id": 124243, "time": "2009-01-21T12:25:59Z", "creator": "edwin@cheatah.nl", "creation_time": "2009-01-21T12:25:59Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
