In this configuration I see no means for the Tomcat server to know if the the connection to the Apache httpd server was by HTTP or HTTPS.\n\nIt would be useful to have an extra header to know what protocol was used to access the httpd server. For example:\n\nx-protocol: https\n\nx-protocol: http\n\nMy current need is to be able to establish whether the cookies sent to the server were sent using an encrypted connection or not. This would allow me to be able to flag any instances where an HTTPS cookie was being sent in an unencrypted HTTP session."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "text": "You can already do this with mod_headers (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/mod_headers.html#requestheader).
