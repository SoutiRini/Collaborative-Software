[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23553, "text": "I have a UNIX perl scrip which calls a java program in a loop. The java \nprogram just prints the arguments received from the perl. The UNIX perl \nprogram invokes the java program in a loop for 100 times, then goes to sleep \nand redoes the loop.\nI have seen that quite often the java program doesn't return which makes the \nperl program to hang. I am using Log4j version 1.2.8 in the java program to do \nloggin. I see the last debug statement in the java program being printed in \nthe log file, but due to some reason sometimes the java program doesn't exit.\n\nI modified the java program to have no logging and also to a version where I \nwas doing logging and put a System.exit at the end. These two versions never \ngot hung, but the original version of the java program gets hung.\nPlease let me know if this is a known problem in log4j or if you need more \ninfo from me.", "id": 44966, "time": "2003-10-01T21:21:31Z", "creator": "surjit321@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2003-10-01T21:21:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23553, "text": "We need a ton more info, such as the program itself and the test script you \nused, so that we may reproduce the problem.", "id": 68426, "time": "2004-12-13T20:51:02Z", "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "creation_time": "2004-12-13T20:51:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
