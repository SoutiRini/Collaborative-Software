However, because of type erasure, there's no way for toArray to know what the correct type is, and instead returns an Object[] instead of an ActionListener[]. Changed code to use the non-reflective version of toArray which correctly returns the real type of the array.\n\nAlso changed preActionPerformed to use the non-reflective version as well, even though that code was correct. (But using this version is more performant)."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49394, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 137389, "time": "2010-06-06T15:58:11Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-06-06T15:58:11Z", "text": "Thanks, patch applied:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=951940&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 49394 - Classcast Exception in ActionRouter.postActionPerformed\n\nModified:\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/gui/action/ActionRouter.java\n   jakarta/jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n\n\nBTW, did you get a CCE, or was this a bug found by Findbugs?"}]
