(see the patch attached)\n\n\"AH00565: request failed: URI too long (longer than xxxx)\"\n\nCurrently, it's kind of confusing without reading the code. I even do not know what the \"URI\" refers to when saw the log message: I didn't know whether it's a problem on the server side or client side.\n\nHaving read the code, I know this's because and only because the client's HTTP request-line exceeds the server's \"LimitRequestLine\" setting.\n\nCompared with \"LimitRequestLine\", the log message of \"LimitRequestFieldsize\" is very very clear:\n\n\"AH00561: Request header exceeds LimitRequestFieldSize\"\n\nMoreover, the current message is not acurrate because request-line also consists of the HTTP method and protocol version besides URI.\n\nI wonder whether we can have the same style of logging, which is implemented in the patch. \n\nNotice that the logging is at the place where \"This is only going to happen if it exceeds the configured limit for a request-line\", so the patch is valid. (You can search \"HTTP_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LARGE\" in the code to verify it) \n\nThanks,\nJackie", "id": 164470, "time": "2013-01-08T09:40:17Z", "creator": "jackie.qq.zhang@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2013-01-08T09:40:17Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 54384, "attachment_id": null, "id": 164640, "time": "2013-01-15T20:22:41Z", "creator": "christophe.jaillet@wanadoo.fr", "creation_time": "2013-01-15T20:22:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thank you for the report.\nI agree with your analysis.\n\nThis has been applied to trunk.\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=1433613\n\nIf nobody complains, I will propose for backport for 2.4.x in the coming days."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Proposed for backport to v2.4.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 166959, "creator": "minfrin@sharp.fm", "time": "2013-04-30T12:37:30Z", "bug_id": 54384, "creation_time": "2013-04-30T12:37:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Backported to v2.4.5.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 167145, "creator": "minfrin@sharp.fm", "time": "2013-05-12T10:28:24Z", "bug_id": 54384, "creation_time": "2013-05-12T10:28:24Z", "is_private": false}]
