[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hello,\nThis is the description of the problem (a user gave it on the URL accompaning URL):\n\n\"I've just installed apache v2.2.6 and am trying to change the DocumentRoot to a\nseparate drive, D drive, which it doesn't seem to like.\n\nFor example, if I set the DocumentRoot to:\n\nDocumentRoot \"C:/test\"\n...\n<Directory \"C:/test\">\n\nThen everything works fine, however if I move the directory and change those to\nD:/test, then try to restart the service, it gives me an error saying \"The\nrequested operation has failed\", and that's it.\nI've also tried setting up virtual hosts but I get the same result, it works\nfine on C drive but as soon as I try on D drive the apache service won't even start.\n\nI've been searching but have been unable to find any help. I've found a couple\nof posts with people asking about the same problem but none have had answers.\nOne such post here: http://www.webservertalk.com/archive199-2004-2-116658.html\n\nThough strangely he says it worked when he tried it on Windows XP, which is what\nI am running it on.\n\nI could just copy my local copy to C drive, but I would really rather not do\nthat if I don't need to, so if anyone could help that would be greatly\nappreciated. If I've left out any important information, which I probably have,\nlet me know and I'll post it.\"\n\nI personally cannot even change the DocumentRoot to a location into my C. Maybe\nit's a bug of \"httpd.exe -k start\", because issueing \"httpd.exe -w -e debug\" for\nexample, makes apache to comply to new configuration (DocumentRoot).", "is_private": false, "id": 110283, "creator": "enerata@gmail.com", "time": "2007-11-06T16:09:39Z", "bug_id": 43802, "creation_time": "2007-11-06T16:09:39Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43802, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Bugzilla is not a user support forum.\n\nThis is a permissions or scope problem of /your/ OS drive assignments.\n\nPlease refer your question to your vendor one one of the many user suppport\nlists and forums available.\n", "id": 110284, "time": "2007-11-06T16:16:27Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-11-06T16:16:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Bugzilla is not a user support forum.\n\nThis is a permissions or scope problem of /your/ OS drive assignments.\n\nPlease refer your question to your vendor one one of the many user suppport\nlists and forums available.\n", "is_private": false, "id": 110285, "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "time": "2007-11-06T16:16:43Z", "bug_id": 43802, "creation_time": "2007-11-06T16:16:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43802, "is_private": false, "id": 110287, "creation_time": "2007-11-06T16:54:11Z", "time": "2007-11-06T16:54:11Z", "creator": "enerata@gmail.com", "text": "Just installed version 2.0.69.
