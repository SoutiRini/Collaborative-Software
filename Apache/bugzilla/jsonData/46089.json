However, even that creates some overhead and additional console or log output and requires it to be made smart. I haven't found a way around this except by creating my own shell for ant that creates new targets dynamically and then runs those. In my example, running \"b+c\" instead of \"b c\" would result in \"a b c\" instead of \"a b a c\" execution.\n\nI believe something like this may be useful for general public.", "id": 121873, "time": "2008-10-25T07:33:33Z", "creator": "asusnjar@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-10-25T07:33:33Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 121906, "time": "2008-10-27T07:44:55Z", "bug_id": 46089, "creation_time": "2008-10-27T07:44:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "-Dant.executor.class=org.apache.tools.ant.helper.SingleCheckExecutor"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46089, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hmm... cool.
