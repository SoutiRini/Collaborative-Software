(Filed under 2.2.13 because it does the same under the current release)\n\nFor clarity, 80 is a valid UID, adding:\n\nelse {log_err(\"uid ok - (%d)\\n\",uid);}\n\nafter the clause produced \"[2009-08-22 09:02:22]: uid ok - (80)\" for VHosts with a higher RLimitCPU set, and ran the CGIs as expected\n\nRemoving exit(112) from support/suexec.c and reinstalling didn't stop the CGIs from failing.
