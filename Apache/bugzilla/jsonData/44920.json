[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44920, "attachment_id": 21900, "text": "Created attachment 21900\nsee bug description\n\nRunning FOP 0.95beta from the command line on the attached XSL-FO and producing a PDF output, I get no warnings/errors and the expected text on the first page up until \"LOOK HERE\". Then follows an empty second page and the end of the document, even though there is some text left in the XSL-FO. I expected the text to be printed on the 2nd page.\n\nRemoving the attribute keep-with-previous.within-column='always' from the table row below \"LOOK HERE\" makes the text on the 2nd page appear again.\n\nFOP 0.94 behaves differently and does not hide any text, but breaks the table apart a bit early imho (there seems to be plenty of place left at the bottom of page 1).\n\nThe support for keep-with-previous should be partial, as per the compliance page (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/compliance.html#fo-property-keep-with-previous).\nThe comments there read:\n    * [0.20.5] works only in table rows\n    * [0.94] works on all implemented FOs, except list- and table-related and\n      inline-level FOs.\n    * [0.95] works on all implemented FOs, except list- and inline-level FOs.\n    * [0.94 and later] <integer> values are not supported.\nI would expect my document not to work in 0.94 but to work in 0.95, as the usage of keep-with-previous is table-related. Nevertheless, not showing parts of the table is a bit unexpected.  Just ignoring the keep-with-previous attribute would have been fine. :)", "id": 116128, "time": "2008-05-02T03:01:59Z", "creator": "torsten.blix@sdm.de", "creation_time": "2008-05-02T03:01:59Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "adelmelle@apache.org", "text": "\nShould be fixed in the 0.95 branch.
