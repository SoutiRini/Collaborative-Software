[{"count": 0, "text": "I have been using Fop-0.18.1-DEV for a while now and have encountered some \nproblems with the PDF generated.   The most concrete of these is that Adobe \nAcrobat converter for the Palm refuses to convert seemingly \"any\" complex Fop-\ngenerated file, claiming that it has a bad page contents.   (There doesn't seem \nto be a version number for this converter, but it's the \"Public Beta\" for \nAcrobat Reader 5.0, available from \nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readerforpalm.html)\nThe full error message is:\n\"Error converting to tagged PDF: Could not read page structure (bad page \ncontents) [3].\"   (where the 3 is the page on which it encountered the problem).\n\nThe FO for the simplest problem example I can generate problems with is \navailable as http://users.breathemail.net/njr/fop/r.fo, and the PDF generated \nby fop is there also as http://users.breathemail.net/njr/fop/r.pdf.   This FO \nwas generated using XT, but I don't imagine that is very relevant.\n\nObviously this could be a problem with the Acrobat converter, but I am assuming \nthat Adobe effectively acts as the \"gold standard\" for PDF, and it is \nexplicitly claiming that there is an error in the PDF.
