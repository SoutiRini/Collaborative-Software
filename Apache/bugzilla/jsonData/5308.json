The current implementation of generateInclude will flush the \noutput stream (which is actually a BodyContent object) which will result in an \nexception since BodyContent doesn't support flush.  I thought I could avoid \nthis problem by using <jsp:includ flush=\"false\">, but as explained before, that \ndoesn't work.  Actually according to section 4.4. of the jsp specification the \ndefault should be to NOT flush the output stream before an include and it \nappears that the current implementation always does the opposite.", "bug_id": 5308, "is_private": false, "id": 8677, "time": "2001-12-06T10:49:45Z", "creator": "jakarta@appling.org", "creation_time": "2001-12-06T10:49:45Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5308, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 8840, "time": "2001-12-12T11:07:00Z", "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "creation_time": "2001-12-12T11:07:00Z", "text": "The attribute is picked up by the compiler and passed to\norg.apache.jasper.runtime.JspRuntimeLibrary.include.
