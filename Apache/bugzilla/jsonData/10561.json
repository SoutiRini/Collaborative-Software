I have made my own patch to fix the problem, but I\nam not a programmer, and hacking every new Apache release isn't appealing."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 10561, "attachment_id": null, "id": 23044, "time": "2002-09-18T15:43:47Z", "creator": "jim@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-09-18T15:43:47Z", "is_private": false, "text": "use the new ProtocolReqCheck directive to disable this.
