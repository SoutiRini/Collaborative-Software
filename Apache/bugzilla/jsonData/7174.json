Well no offense to\nthe author but it scares me from contributing.  The words are all cramped\ntogether and it doesn't give a clear path.  Its \"information dumping\" at its\nworse.  We need to create a page that welcomes people into the project, walks\nthem through it step by step, explains things like:\n\n1. Don't work in the dark (commit or patch often)\n2. how to create a patch\n3. Where to get Excel 97 Developer's kit for HSSF contributers/other docs\n4. links to other docs for other formats and other file format resources\n5. yes you REally truly can just start sending in patches and we'll apply them\n6. link to the POI \"coding standards\" resolution\n7. Explanation of how to have a productive conversation.  (ie.don't start a\ndiscussion about coding standards, just try to set a good example and hope\nothers follow)\n8. Pointers to project vision\n\nBasically the page should say welcome, please send in your patches and we'll be\nhappy to apply them (you can leave out the obvious like: if they don't suck). \nWant to get involved but don't know where to start?  Why thats a great place to\nget involved, write a page of what you find you need.  Anyhow look at these\nthings that need to get done: etc etc.  But it needs to be in a clear and\nconceise format that doesn't case MEGO syndrome (my eyes glaze over).  It\nprobably needs to be in multiple pages. . . . wow this is sounding like that\n\"developer's guide\".. . Anyhow first problem -- \"contributing\" page needs to\nchange to not be how it is now.  Next problem: need a \"contributer's guide\"...\n\n-ACO"}]
