So I'm resubmitting it.\n\n--- Begin forwarded text ---\n\nOne problem with mod_usertrack is that it generates lot of bogus unique\nusers for clients which never send a cookie (like indexing robots),\nmaking the results completely useless.\n\nOne way would be just to set the cookie note for incoming cookies, and not\nfor the just generated ones. This solves the problem with robots and the\nunique users count will be correct (or almost).\n\nHowever, such solution prevents counting of new users (unless you have\ncomplete cookie database, too).\n\nThe solution below is designed so it sets one additional apache note,\ncookiedir, which contains \"in\" when the cookie came from the requests and \"out\"\nwhen the cookie is being sent out for the first time. (Note that it can\nalso be unset for requests where no cookie was generated - this usually\nhappens for requests which generate some kind of error response. In this\ncase, %{cookiedir}n comes out as single dash, as usual).\n\nThis way the logs can contain complete information about what was going on."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jim@apache.org", "text": "What solution??", "id": 67858, "time": "2004-12-03T02:20:02Z", "bug_id": 24157, "creation_time": "2004-12-03T02:20:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
