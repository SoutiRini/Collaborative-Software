XWPFWordExtractor extracts the footnote just fine, but location of the footnote reference is lost.\n\nExample:\n\nextractor.getText() on \"test-data/document/footnotes.docx\" returns:\n\"Eto ochen prostoy text so snoskoy\n[1:  snoska]\"\nThe position just after the word \"prostoy\" contains footnote reference, but the returned text does not contain such reference.\n\nSuggested improvement:\n\nLet's insert a footnote reference into output text, for example, like this:\n\"Eto ochen prostoy[fnote:1] text so snoskoy\n[1: snoska]\"\nThe footnotes marked such way could be used for accurate rendering in HTML (or any other relevant format).\n\nSolution: attached patch contains change for \"XWPFRun.java\" and relevant test in \"TestXWPFWordExtractor.java\"."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "text": "This was already applied via r1492308 on 2013-06-12 via github pull #3 and thus this is already included in POI 3.10 and newer releases.
