Prior to upgrading to Tomcat 5.5.12, we would put\nour web app into a directory (eg d:\\wwwroot\\test), use the Admin console to\ncreate a virtual host with the appBase pointing to this directory\n(d:/wwwroot/test), then create a root context with a docBase of \"./\" and a path\nof \"/\".  This all worked perfectly.\n\nSince upgrading to Tomcat 5.5.12, we find that this process works as before,\nuntil we restart Tomcat.  Then the application fails to work and the following\nappears in the Tomcat error log:\n\nWARNING: A docBase D:\\wwwroot\\test\\. inside the host appBase has been specified,\nand will be ignored\n16/11/2005 11:29:29 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext resourcesStart\nSEVERE: Error starting static Resources\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Document base d:\\wwwroot\\test\\ROOT does not\nexist or is not a readable directory\n\nI can provide a suitable example application for testing if required.", "id": 82551, "time": "2005-11-16T05:20:06Z", "creator": "rob@netpaver.com.au", "creation_time": "2005-11-16T05:20:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37523, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 82555, "time": "2005-11-16T11:15:51Z", "creator": "remm@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-11-16T11:15:51Z", "text": "Well, sorry, this is as expected.
