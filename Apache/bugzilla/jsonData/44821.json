Firstly, it broke the existing unit tests, and didn't provide any new ones, so I had to patch it to work with the unit tests\n\nThen, there was the issue that calling extractor.getText() more than once caused the decorations to be applied multiple times. I've changed how the decorators work so that's no longer the case\n\nI suspect we'll need to tweak things some more once we integrate the XmlCursor stuff the XmlBeans guys have suggested, so we can get comments and hyperlinks in-place"}]
