If a page hasn't changed, the page will be delivered directly from the servlet's cache instead of the JSP page. While working with Tomcat/Jasper on AIX I encountered the following problem:\r\nIf I view a page with IE 5.0, press CTRL+F5 (reload all) and hold down these keys, IE obviously send out many requests which in turn causes the JVM to throw a SocketException in\r\nserverSocket.accept(). Tomcat catches this exception and sets running to false which kills Tomcat. If you comment out the line which stops Tomcat, everything is fine.\r\n\r\nhope this helps\r\nmatthias\r\n\r\n", "id": 216, "time": "2000-11-14T11:33:59Z", "creator": "dev@tomcat.apache.org", "creation_time": "2000-11-14T11:33:59Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "marc.saegesser@apropos.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Seems to be fixed in Tomcat 3.2.", "id": 1119, "time": "2001-03-09T12:33:56Z", "bug_id": 238, "creation_time": "2001-03-09T12:33:56Z", "is_private": false}]
