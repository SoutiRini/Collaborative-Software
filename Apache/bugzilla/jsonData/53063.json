[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "dmikusa@gopivotal.com", "text": "According to the documentation, the \"maxConnections\" property of a BIO HTTP Connector defaults to the value of \"maxThreads\".\n\nAdditionally, the documentation states that if the \"executor\" property is specified, any thread related properties on the Connector will be ignored.  This includes \"maxThreads\".\n\nHowever, when a BIO HTTP Connector is defined with an executor, the default value for \"maxConnections\" does not take the \"maxThreads\" value from the Executor.  In fact, it appears to take the \"maxThreads\" value from the Connector object, which is supposed to be ignored.\n\nhttps://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html#Standard_Implementation\n\n\nThis can be confirmed with the following test.\n\n1.) Download Tomcat 7.0.27.\n2.) Edit \"conf/server.xml\", uncomment the \"tomcatThreadPool\" executor, comment out the default HTTP connector and uncomment the HTTP connector below it that uses the executor.\n3.) Start Tomcat and connect with jconsole\n4.) Look at the Catalina -> ProtocolHandler -> 8080 -> maxConnections.  It will be set to 200 and not 150 (maxThreads on the executor).\n5.) Now, stop Tomcat, edit \"conf/server.xml\", add a \"maxThreads\" attribute to the connector, set the value to 300 and start tomcat.\n6.) Examine the Catalina -> ProtocolHandler -> 8080 -> maxConnections property again and it'll be set to 300.\n\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1.) Update the documentation to indicate that \"maxConnections\" for a BIO HTTP Connector defaults to \"maxThreads\" on the Connector, regardless of the presence of an executor.\n\n2.) Fix the \"maxConnections\" default so that it takes its value from \"maxThreads\" on the executor, when an executor is specified.\n\nMy preferences would be for #2.", "id": 157940, "time": "2012-04-11T13:14:14Z", "bug_id": 53063, "creation_time": "2012-04-11T13:14:14Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "Fixed (option #2) in trunk and 7.0.x and will be included in 7.0.28 onwards.", "id": 158964, "time": "2012-05-10T21:11:49Z", "bug_id": 53063, "creation_time": "2012-05-10T21:11:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
