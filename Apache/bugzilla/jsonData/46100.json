Would you intend to be active within the log4j community and support the appender on the mailing list?\n\nThe recent trend in the project is to place appenders with dependencies on JDK 1.4 and later or other new dependencies into log4j \"companions\".  Whether this appender would be a candidate for inclusion in log4j proper or packaged as a companion would need to be decided on log4j-dev?\n\n \n\n\n"}]
