I developed a Portuguese \nhyphenation table and this bug did not allow it to work correctly. I had to write <hyphen-min \nbefore=\"2\" after=\"1\"/> instead of <hyphen-min before=\"2\" after=\"2\"/> to get around the bug. I \nwill gladly submit the table but it will only work properly if this bug is fixed. (Well, the other \ntables are not working properly too.)\nTo observe the error, simply try to hyphenate \"banana\". \nIn English you get \"ba-nana\" instead of the correct (?) \"ba-nan-a\" (jeez, hyphenation in English is a \ncomplete madness...) even with after=\"1\". In Spanish (and in the original Portuguese, from a \nobscure origin) you get the same \"ba-nana\" instead of the correct (!) \"ba-na-na\", unless you \ndeviously use after=\"1\".", "is_private": false, "id": 17934, "creator": "jaccoud@petrobras.com.br", "time": "2002-06-17T19:18:50Z", "bug_id": 9930, "creation_time": "2002-06-17T19:18:50Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9930, "attachment_id": null, "id": 156209, "time": "2012-04-01T07:05:00Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:05:00Z", "is_private": false, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed"}]
