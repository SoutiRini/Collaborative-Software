[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61009, "attachment_id": null, "text": "With a static MPM, `httpd -V` will correctly print out the compiled settings, even if the configuration file is invalid or completely missing. With MPM DSOs, an invalid configuration will prevent the compiled settings from being printed, even if we know all of them.\n\nAn example I run into commonly is in normal HTTPS operation, where the private key is stored in a folder that's only accessible by the superuser. This prevents non-superusers from being able to run `httpd -V`... but only if they're using dynamic MPMs.\n\nI don't think a configtest is ever appropriate during -V operation. Users who want a configtest can run a configtest. In the situation where we can figure out which MPM is in use during ap_read_config(), we should immediately print what we know and exit. Even if we can't read the configuration at all, we can print out the settings we *do* know, and mark the MPM as [unknown] or something.", "id": 198374, "time": "2017-04-19T19:35:26Z", "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "creation_time": "2017-04-19T19:35:26Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61009, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 198386, "time": "2017-04-19T20:39:17Z", "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "creation_time": "2017-04-19T20:39:17Z", "text": "Fix checked into trunk at r1791975."}]
