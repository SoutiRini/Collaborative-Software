[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50042, "text": "Hi, Apache community!\n\nWe have configured our applications to run through apache 2.2.15 http server. Access to SVN is configured through apache as well(mod_dav_svn, mod_authz_svn modules). We faced the trouble with incorrect commit authors which happens only sometimes, i.e. several times each 3-4 days some commits appear to be with incorrectly determined commit authors(other users). \nWhen a user performs svn operation the request passes through 2 apache http servers(both of 2.2.15 version), the first apache checks the user for validity and redirects the request to another apache http server which deals with svn.\nThe problem is not reproduced if the request is passed to the second apache directly.\nWe have noticed that the problem does not happen after the restart of the apache server. Thus I suppose the problem is related to some memory usage.\n\nCould you help in resolving this trouble, please? \n\nPlease, tell me if any additional information is needed.\n\nRegards,\nNick", "id": 140435, "time": "2010-10-04T08:04:50Z", "creator": "nikolai.samotyrski@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-10-04T08:04:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please use a support forum such as the users mailinglist.", "id": 140439, "time": "2010-10-04T08:47:25Z", "bug_id": 50042, "creation_time": "2010-10-04T08:47:25Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "nikolai.samotyrski@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi, Nick Kew!\n\nCould you, please, hint me where in http://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html I can post a problem?\n\nRegards,\nNick\n\n(In reply to comment #1)\n> Please use a support forum such as the users mailinglist.", "id": 140440, "time": "2010-10-04T08:58:44Z", "bug_id": 50042, "creation_time": "2010-10-04T08:58:44Z", "is_private": false}]
