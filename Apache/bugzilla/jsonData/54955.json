This feature is working when an application is deployed, but broken when it's reloaded. A reload will result in 404 error. (Other url mappings are OK, only \"\")\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1) Create a servlet with URL mapping as empty string, you can either use @WebServlet(\"\") annotation or <url-pattern></url-pattern> in web.xml\n\n2) If you deploy it in Tomcat 7.0.40, it will work. (e.g. http://localhost:8080/myapp/) \n\n3) But if you reload the app (say using the manager app), http://localhost:8080/myapp/ will give 404 error. Servlet in step 1 is never called this time.\n\nActual Results: 404 Not Found\n\nExpected Results: Show the context root page.\n\nEnv: Tomcat 7.0.40, Java 7, Windows 8"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 167316, "time": "2013-05-21T03:55:09Z", "bug_id": 54955, "creation_time": "2013-05-21T03:55:09Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for the report.\nFixed in trunk and 7.0.x and will be included in 7.0.41 onwards."}]
