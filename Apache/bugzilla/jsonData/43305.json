Do you have any other examples, or did you just draw that conclusion based on the \npresence of the substring 'char'?\n\nAnyways, if I run 'This is Turbocharged.' through FOP's hyphenator, there seems to be nothing wrong. \nAre you sure you have hyphenation pattern files available and FOP can find them? Did you also use the \nlanguage property to indicate which hyphenation pattern should be used?\nCheck for warnings like \"Hyphenation pattern 'none' not found\".\n\nIn the meantime, I'm closing this bug.
