When there is a\nparser error, I catch the error/exception and display a message box\nwith the string attached to Xerces exception.\nThe problem here is that this string is always in English.\n\nAre resource files available to get error strings in any non-english\nlanguage?\nI notice that under \"apache\\xerces\\msg\" folder there are a few resource files \n(e.g. ExceptionMessages.class, XMLMessages.class). Where can I find \ncorresponding .java files? If I had these I would create my own localized \nversion of resource files and add them to xerces.jar that would be shipped with \nmy application.\n\nThanks in advance for any clarification."}]
