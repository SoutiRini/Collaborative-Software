We still have trouble with Largefiles (2GB and more) and with (206) Partial\nContent (Content-Range Headers). We have analyse the Traffic. We see the Apache\nServer can not write values greater than 2GB correctly. The Content-Length will\nhave a negative value. I fixed this in the source, but the Problems are still\nalive on the Content-Range Headers. The problem is, the internal Apache Code\nwill work with a LONG C-Type. The LONG C-Type is ONLY 32 bit (GCC,\nSolaris/SPARC). If i compile with LARGE_FILES options (man lf64) that will not\nwork, because the Apache does not use OFF_T C-Type. We have fixed this manually\nin serverals Sourcecodes (protocol.c, core.c, ...) but something will go\nstrange, the Apache will core.\n\nWe have an internal system with many files greater then 2GB. Our View-Tool will\nnow (after a patch party) work with Partial Content greater then 2GB. But the\nApache give us negative numbers, all the time. Our view-tool will not work ....\n\nYou can contact me all times. i try to fix the problem, but i think i need help,\nbecause, this problem is very global.\n\nUsing of GCC -m64 (64 bit compile) -> long's are 64bit, will NOT work, because\nGCC is not really 64bit able, and the code will be very very slow ...."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28491, "text": "Apache httpd 2.2 will have large file support.", "id": 62437, "time": "2004-08-24T20:50:59Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2004-08-24T20:50:59Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
