Netware \n5.1 with apache 1.3.23 (multiprocessor).  I am unable to download 1.3.24 as it \nis not in the binary directory.\n\nMy problem:\nMy error_log will fill up with the following error:\n\n[Tue Mar 19 10:43:40 2002] [error] (1)No such file or directory: accept: (client\n socket) failed with errno = 10014\n\nWhen the log fills up, I'm talking that within a matter of a few minutes, it \nwill go from 50K TO 18 Gig!  I have set my http.conf with (ThreadsPerChild 100) \nand (MaxRequestsPerChild 5000) and I still get the errors.  It actually locks \nup the apache process and I am forced to do a unload apache and then load \napache in order to get my web services back.\nI don't know if it is related, but I get the following in the error_log quite a \nbit over the last few weeks:\n\n[Sat Mar 23 14:50:20 2002] [error] [client 217.109.234.13] File does not exist: \nvol1:/website/bhs/_vti_bin/..%5c../..%5c../..%5c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe\n\nI see that this is one of the fixes for the Win32, but does it affect Novell as \nwell?  It seems that I tend to get the crash about an hour (or so) after I get \nthe above message.  Like I say, I don't know if it is related or not.  Could \njust be coincidence.\n\nI see that the 1.3.24 is released yet when I go to the binaries/netware \ndirectory, it is still only at 1.3.23.   I would be interested in the log \nrotation as well.  (Did you know that on Novell the error_log and access_log do \nnot update the directory to show the actuall size until after you unload \napache? This makes it so that you cannot see the actual size of the files \nunless you shut down the web server and then start it back up.)\n\nPlease email me and let me know if this is something that is being worked on \n(or not) or if you need more information. (i.e. conf files, error_logs, etc)\n\nThank you.\n\n\nDaryl Bjerke\ndbjerke@bemidji.k12.mn.us\nNetwork Administrator\nBemidji High School\nBemidji, MN USA\n(218)444-1600 ext 3314\n\n\"Out the token ring, through the router, down the fiber, off a switch, past the \nfirewall, down the T1 ... nothing but Net.\"", "id": 12320, "time": "2002-03-25T20:23:03Z", "bug_id": 7462, "creation_time": "2002-03-25T20:23:03Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 7462, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 12322, "time": "2002-03-25T21:15:32Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-03-25T21:15:32Z", "text": "Might as well have the correct version."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "A 1.3.26 (and 2.0.40) netware binary release is now available.
