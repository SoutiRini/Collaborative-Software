The msi installer doesn\u2019t validate what the user has chosen and move to the last stage. Normally an Apache folder will be created under Program Files but it does not in our case.\n\nMoreover, running the msi installer again we can see it is aware of this existing custom installation and give two options of Repair and Remove. After clicking Repair and it\u2019ll run the repair procedure. However if you attempt to run the installer again, it will no longer give you the Repair and Remove options, that mean the previous repairing procedure caused the installation removed.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Download Apache HTTP Server 2.2.10 - Win32 Binary including OpenSSL 0.9.8i (MSI Installer) from http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi\n2. Install Apache HTTP server 2.2.10 with Custom installation chosen.\n3. Uncheck all the Features except Apache HTTP Server 2.2.10 in the next screen and click Next, then wait till it finished.\n4. Run the msi installer again and attempt to Repair.\n5. Run the installer for the 3rd time, you can see now the previous installation has been removed despite Repair was chosen."}]
