IMHO, a text extractor should open with PackageAccess.READ instead. Not doing so may cause POI to modify the file when the package's close method is called for some reason, a behavior a client would not expect from a text extractor.\n\nAlso, in my case, this issue caused my program to get stuck in an infinite loop, as the program was constantly reindexing files which it thought were modified.\n\nBest regards"}, {"count": 1, "text": "This was actually fixed in r1652877 already.", "creator": "dominik.stadler@gmx.at", "is_private": false, "id": 181978, "time": "2015-03-22T21:54:18Z", "bug_id": 55519, "creation_time": "2015-03-22T21:54:18Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}]
