This is also implied by the description of \"ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain\" (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypassreverse): \"Usage is basically similar to ProxyPassReverse, but instead of rewriting headers that are a URL, this rewrites the domain string in Set-Cookie headers.\"\n\nNevertheless, \"ProxyPassReverse\" accepts a balancer as argument, extracting the relevant domain information on it's own, where \"ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain\" does not. Actually, it does accept the balancer as argument but does not extract the relevant domain information from it, instead using it as a direct match against the \"Domain\" parts of cookies - which of course is not what is desired in such a use case.\n\nI suggest to change the directives so they both use the existing code to extract the domain information from the balancer.", "id": 164556, "time": "2013-01-10T09:03:28Z", "bug_id": 54401, "creation_time": "2013-01-10T09:03:28Z", "is_private": false}]
