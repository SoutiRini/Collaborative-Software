[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 15893, "text": "We use the Embedded Tomcat as a help server in Eclipse and have a need to run \nTomcat on an arbitrary port. In particular, we want to createa Connector by \npassing port=0, have the system pick up port when a ServetSocket is created, \nand later we want to retrieve that port.\npossible solution is to add a getPort() method on the Connector.\n\nIn 4.0.4, we got around this by setting our own ServerSocketFactory on the \nConnector, and keep track of the port created. \nWe were looking at moving to Tomcat 4.1.18, but the factory there is only used \nfor secure connections, for the other connection a DefaultServerSocketFactory \nis used, so we're stuck.\n\nA possible solution is to add a getPort() on the Connector that can return the \nreal port used. There would be a sequencing problem here, as thep port may only \nbe known after the Connector is started, but that'll be ok.", "id": 29022, "time": "2003-01-08T16:42:51Z", "creator": "birsan@ca.ibm.com", "creation_time": "2003-01-08T16:42:51Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Such a method exists on the coyote connector.", "id": 90048, "time": "2006-06-10T16:49:03Z", "bug_id": 15893, "creation_time": "2006-06-10T16:49:03Z", "is_private": false}]
