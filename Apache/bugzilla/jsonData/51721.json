It is also less understandably not in the Apache Snapshot Repository: http://repository.apache.org/snapshots/\n\nPossible fixes for me would be:\n-either to release 1.2.17 and deploy it to central,\n-deploy 1.2.17-SNAPSHOT to the above Apache Snapshot Repository.\n\nFor now, I am stuck with using a custom compiled and deployed 1.2.17-SNAPSHOT in the \"3rd party\" self-hosted repository of my Repository Manager.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJulien", "id": 148814, "time": "2011-08-25T09:34:29Z", "creator": "julien.poum@free.fr", "creation_time": "2011-08-25T09:34:29Z", "attachment_id": null}]
