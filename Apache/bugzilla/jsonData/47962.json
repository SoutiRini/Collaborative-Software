Presumably this change is intended to reduce the likelihood of a NullPointerException.  In many cases however, it was clear that 'foo' could not be null, and the code was left as-is for readability.\n\nRegarding the box constructor vs valueOf() method changes - I'm pretty sure there were no places where POI needs distinct instances, so most of these were OK.  However, a few changes were not applied for these reasons:\n  - caching of box instances generally applies to small integral values near zero.\n  - Double.valueOf(double) does not utilize a DoubleCache or similar.\n  - Boolean.FALSE is better than Boolean.valueOf(false).\n\n\nIf you are keen to fix other compiler warnings that would be very much appreciated.  Please try to keep the patches smaller, to make them easier to QA."}]
