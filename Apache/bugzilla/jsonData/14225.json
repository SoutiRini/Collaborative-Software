[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14225, "text": "Hi!\nWhen the JUnit task is used with the \"timeout\" attribute, and the test times \nout, it creates empty result file(s).\n\nThis causes the following \"warning\" in the JUnitReport task:\n[junitreport] [Fatal Error] :-1:-1: Premature end of file.\n[junitreport] The file foobar.xml is not a valid XML document. It is possibly \ncorrupted.\n\nThe JUnitReport task still creates a report, but the report doesn't include any \ninformation about the failed test. This means that you may easily get fooled \ninto believing that all tests went through successfully, when they in fact \ndidn't.\n\nIMO, there are basically two problems here;\n\n 1) In the event of a timeout, the JUnit task should still create output files \nproperly indicating a timeout as the reason for the failure.\n\n 2) The JUnitReport task should provide a hint in the report that there was a \nfailure when processing the input files. Alternatively, it should fail \naltogether without creating any report at all.", "id": 25612, "time": "2002-11-04T14:34:47Z", "creator": "christer.a.palm@foreningssparbanken.se", "creation_time": "2002-11-04T14:34:47Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14225, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 2499 ***", "id": 25681, "time": "2002-11-05T13:01:18Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-11-05T13:01:18Z", "is_private": false}]
