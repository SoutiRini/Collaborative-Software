This wouldn't be an issue if the column would remember the width once you resize it, but after you switch away from the element and back again the columns are needlessly narrow again.\n\nSo, it would be cool if the columns either stay the width they are resized to or if they could be as wide as the widest element in them\n\neg like this:\n\n| Name        | User_1                |            |\n|-------------------------------------|   little   |\n| longvarname | bla                   |   wasted   |\n| short       | even longer var value |   space    |\n\ncurrently it's more like this:\n\n| Name      | User_1    |                          |\n|-----------------------|         much             |\n| longvarna | bla       |         wasted           |\n| short     | even long |         space            |\n\nthanks for considering :)\n\nbr,\nImm", "id": 153829, "time": "2012-02-16T09:48:21Z", "creator": "immanuel.hayden@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-02-16T09:48:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "text": "This \"regression\" is an effect of fix to 27112.", "count": 1, "id": 153893, "time": "2012-02-17T20:49:36Z", "bug_id": 52679, "creation_time": "2012-02-17T20:49:36Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "immanuel.hayden@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 28350, "is_private": false, "id": 153912, "time": "2012-02-18T09:43:11Z", "bug_id": 52679, "creation_time": "2012-02-18T09:43:11Z", "text": "Created attachment 28350\nmin-width vs width\n\nthought so much ;)\n\nthis is why my idea was, not so much to change this back (as I quite clearly see the use of that feature), but to make the column size choice more intelligent (eg. in css terms: define a min-width instead of a width)\n\nwith my bad html and css skills I created the attached mockup. notice how the second long text gets wrapped when using \"width\" instead of \"min-width\" (yes, I am too stupid to get overflow working just now ;))."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52679, "text": "Created attachment 28351\nProposal patch\n\n* Arbitrary minimum size to 200 px after (nb columns * 200) > table width (and a scroll pane)\n* Else column width = table width / nb column (no scroll pane)", "id": 153916, "time": "2012-02-18T13:21:42Z", "creator": "milamber@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-02-18T13:21:42Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 28351}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52679, "attachment_id": null, "id": 153917, "time": "2012-02-18T15:27:35Z", "creator": "immanuel.hayden@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-02-18T15:27:35Z", "is_private": false, "text": "while definitely an improvement, as far as I understand this, the table is still not \"content-aware\" (eg. mostly short variable names, but much content -> still two columns with the same width)\nI think this guy http://binkley.blogspot.com/2006/01/getting-jtable-columns-widths-to-fit.html has the solution that I would describe as best fitting (without the min-width, but that should be only an if in the right place ;))"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "text": "Hello Milamber, \nUntil we find a better solution, +1 for your solution.\n\nRegards\nPhilippe", "id": 154346, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52679, "creation_time": "2012-02-28T20:36:13Z", "time": "2012-02-28T20:36:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52679, "attachment_id": 28405, "text": "Created attachment 28405\nProposal Patch II\n\nSorry this took me so long ... was not trivial for me to get jmeter compiling because eclipse didn't like it (ended up ditching eclipse in the end).\nAnyhow, here is my proposal patch which I patched together from http://bosmeeuw.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/java-swing-automatically-resize-table-columns-to-their-contents/ ... colums are sized to either fit the content (with a little additional margin) or 100 px minimum width.
