[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48068, "text": "This bug is strongly related to this one:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46987\n\nThe symptom is very similar - the offending Excel file (which I can't attache due to confidentiality issues) contains garbage data beyond the last EOFRecord.\n\nThe fix to bug #46987 ALMOST addresses the issue, but that fix assumes that the next \"record\" immediately after the last EOFRecord can at least be read without error by RecordInputStream#nextRecord(). In this case, however, the garbage data ends up specifying an invalid data length.\n\nIt seems the best way to fix this would be for the code that fixes 46987 in RecordFactoryInputStream#nextRecord() to be reordered to come before the call to _recStream.nextRecord() currently immediately before it. Thus the check would test against _recStream._nextSid instead of _recStream_currentSid.", "id": 131434, "time": "2009-10-27T11:34:00Z", "creator": "robin.salkeld@sap.com", "creation_time": "2009-10-27T11:34:00Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48068, "text": "fixed in <a href=\"http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=899608\">r899608</a>", "id": 133623, "time": "2010-01-15T04:26:31Z", "creator": "max.valjanski@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-01-15T04:26:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
