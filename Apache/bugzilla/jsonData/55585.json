[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hey ^^\nI am new to jmeter and would like to test an application built using asp.net.\nI followed many tutorials, but the problem rise up when I want to use the Proxy Server in order to collect request about a particular scenario: I set the browser to use manual proxy config (localhost, 8080) and start the jmeter proxy. When i reach the welcoming page and input the login info everything is recorded properly, but the problem is: I cannot reach the page after the login, meaning that once I press enter the login page is back with empty input slots. It is worth mentioning that when I enter the login info without the proxy, everything works fine. \nYour help will be appreciated .
