It took me a little while to understand what was \ngoing on...\n\nHere's the deal:\n\nTask: java\nAttribute: output - redirects console output to a file\n\nThat works fine.  Always has.  Then I tried putting a bunch of targets in \n<parallel>, where these targets were calling java with an output attribute.\n\nThe output comes out in the console.  A file is created, but it remains empty.\n\nSolution?  add \"fork=yes\".  Forking the java process returns the behavior to \nnormal.\n\nLike I said: not really a big deal since it can easily be worked around, but a \nmention should be made in the documentation.\n\nCheers,\nMatt", "id": 7106, "time": "2001-10-24T09:11:57Z", "creator": "mlegault@cplane.com", "creation_time": "2001-10-24T09:11:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "conor@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 7180, "time": "2001-10-25T21:40:07Z", "bug_id": 4400, "creation_time": "2001-10-25T21:40:07Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Can you give me some details.
