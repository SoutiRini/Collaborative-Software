In particular, when you have a template-file that needs values to be substituted (not in the \"name=value\" format), it becomes messy and one needs to know the JMeter internals with respect to thread-synchronization. \n\nI would expect a pre-processor with regular expressions (and maybe XPath) to enable substitutions in POST-data, local to the running thread. This would make the learning step lower for non-BeanShell people like me, much more user-friendly and less error-prone (thread-synchronization should be hidden by JMeter instead of explicitly handled in an external script).\n\nIMHO, I think JMeter needs a pre-processor with regex/XPath, analog to the existing post-processors with regex/XPath."}]
