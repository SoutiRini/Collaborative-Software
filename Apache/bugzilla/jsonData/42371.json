The following went\nwrong:\n- create a lot of http traffic, e.g. a site with a lot of pictures\n- stop browsing, with netstat view the open connections by http keepalives (all\n10 pipes allowed for ie6 should be opened)\n- after (default) 15 seconds, apache2 closes the keepalive connections, in\nnetstat you see that for some seconds all pipes have the state wait_close\n- click on e.g. a button in your webpage, because all connections are busy, no\nconnection can be created, which results in a connection error.\n\nWhat seems to be wrong is that e.g. iis does not set the connection to\nwait_close, but closes the connection completely in one step.\n\nMy fix for this problem is to prevent apache2 to keep alive connections to ie6.\nSo in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf i add after <IfModule mod_setenvif.c> the line:\nBrowserMatch \"MSIE 6\\.0;\" nokeepalive", "id": 103015, "time": "2007-05-09T12:58:06Z", "creator": "adriaanvk@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-05-09T12:58:06Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jim@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 114077, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42371, "creation_time": "2008-02-27T13:29:37Z", "time": "2008-02-27T13:29:37Z", "text": "Does not seem to be a Apache bug"}]
