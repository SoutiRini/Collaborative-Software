Consistent formatting also, for me, gives a better impression of the code base and makes it easier to read.\n\nDo we have (or could I raise a ticket about) an eclipse Java code formatter (and maybe one for other IDEs if people use them, or just format code using eclipse http://blogs.operationaldynamics.com/andrew/software/java-gnome/eclipse-code-format-from-command-line)?"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 178488, "time": "2014-10-15T20:52:23Z", "bug_id": 57084, "creation_time": "2014-10-15T20:52:23Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Bugzilla is not ideal for discussions.\n\nPlease use the developer list for discussions on formatting."}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57084, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Changed the title to agree with the action taken", "id": 178489, "time": "2014-10-15T20:53:40Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-10-15T20:53:40Z", "is_private": false}]
