When this happens, the IDE can't distinguish between stdout and stderr output and give stderr a nice red color in the console, which is helpful for distinguishing between real errors and debug messages.\n\nThe attached patch allows this default value of true to be overridden with a system property, and leaves the current functionality (default=true) unchanged."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49804, "text": "6.0.x is (hopefully) in the process of rolling the final release and this patch was not included.\n\nEmbedded in deprecated in 7.0.,x onwards and the replacement does not wrap the streams.", "id": 197581, "time": "2017-03-10T11:19:40Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2017-03-10T11:19:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
