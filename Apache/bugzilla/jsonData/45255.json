You can no longer shoot a simple link to a user, and immediately have access to their session  \n\nRegardless, it does prevent Session Hijacking  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking - (esp. in applications that don't expire the session on the server). \n\nImagine you visit an application at a public PC, and a session ID is written to the URL. When that page is saved to the browser's cache, the URL is saved with the JSESSIONID parameter. A user could simply browse this cache, looking for valid session ids. \n\nSimilarly, the session id can be cached in a proxy cache, or be sniffed along the path. \n\nUntil this is fixed, i'm recommending the following:\n\nPrevent SessionID from being written in the URL.
