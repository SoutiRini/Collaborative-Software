This bug\narise after tomcat is running for a long time. If I restart\ntomcat, it disappears, there's no more password mismatch between\nusers until several hours, days or weeks.\n\nIf I commit changes, I saw the bug inside the tomcat-users.xml\nfile, edited users lost their passwords, with the password of\nthe same other user.\n\nI didn't found yet the conditions that makes the mistmatch but\nwhen it appears, only a restart of tomcat can correct it.\n\nSo I can't use the administration tool to edit user roles or full name\nand have to stop the server, edit the tomcat-users.xml and then \nrestart the server.\n\nThis bug is in release 4.1.29 also, and still in 5.0.18.\n\nThanks for all, I will continue for looking for the bug conditions,\nand may be I will be able to help to correct it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "I am sceptical about this report overall.", "id": 52514, "time": "2004-02-18T22:04:07Z", "bug_id": 27030, "creation_time": "2004-02-18T22:04:07Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Please provide with more precise conditions in which the password mismatch\nhappens.
