If the value is not NULL, the corresponding hash will not be initialized there.\n\nThe attached patch fixes this problem. I suppose it could apply to trunk as well.\n\nThanks!\nPeter"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "committed to 1.5.x in r1382129\nAFAICS this only affected 1.4/1.5, not trunk.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52705, "id": 162005, "time": "2012-09-07T19:05:12Z", "creator": "sf@sfritsch.de", "creation_time": "2012-09-07T19:05:12Z", "is_private": false}]
