Our naming \nconvention for the specific pages is '/path3/feature-browserfamily.html'.\n\nIf HTTP Request 'brq' has Path field value '/path3/feature.html', the test plan \nworks and random parameter values from the Link Parser are used to create a \nquery string and produce '/path3/feature.html?list=listvalue&sel=selvalue'.\n\nIf HTTP Request 'brq' has Path field value '/path3/feature-\nfamilyname.html', '.*' is used as the values for both 'list' and 'sel'.
