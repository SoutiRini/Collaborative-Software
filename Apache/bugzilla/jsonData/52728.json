[{"count": 0, "text": "Here is a quick overview of the problem:\n\nIf there is a BSF sampler in JMeter script and also CSV Data Set Config that loads some external file like *.csv, for some reason, that represents a sign to BSF Sampler that this external file is BSF Script that needs to be loaded in JMeter during execution of the script (In general, these two components shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with each other and variable from CSV Data Set Config shouldn\u2019t be visible from BSF Sampler component). Because it cannot find this file on the path, error with following message will happen:\n\nResponse message: java.io.FileNotFoundException: ${SOME_FILE_PATH} (The system cannot find the file specified)\n\nAlso, with new JMeter 2.6 following drop down menu was added: Script file (overrides script)\nWhen trying to change value from drop down menu and then change focus to some other element and then retrieve back, drop down menu value was reset so it will always try to load bsf script from external file.\n\nI think that two fixes need to be introduced:\n1. Sharing of variables between CSV Data Set Config and BSF Sampler component shouldnt be permitted\n2. Chosen value from Script File drop down menu in BSF Sampler should remain even if we change focus from that component", "bug_id": 52728, "attachment_id": null, "id": 153975, "time": "2012-02-21T11:59:58Z", "creator": "ext-bakir.jusufbegovic@nokia.com", "creation_time": "2012-02-21T11:59:58Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 153978, "time": "2012-02-21T12:13:27Z", "bug_id": 52728, "creation_time": "2012-02-21T12:13:27Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please submit a simplified Test Plan to reproduce the issue.\nRegards"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "ext-bakir.jusufbegovic@nokia.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 153982, "time": "2012-02-21T12:23:09Z", "bug_id": 52728, "creation_time": "2012-02-21T12:23:09Z", "text": "In orer"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52728, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 28358\nSimplified Test Plan\n\nAttached is simplified Test Plan that shows this defect.\nIn this test plan there are two samplers:\n1.
