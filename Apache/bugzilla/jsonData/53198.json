But this should not be the case, where with JDBC4, they internally resolve the JDBC driver by using the Java Service Provider interface. So ideally this should be an optional property. In Apache DBCP, it supported this. So even though it is a minor detail, it is a crtical requirement in migrating an application which used DBCP to jdbc-pool, because of this behavior. \n\nCheers,\nAnjana.", "id": 158869, "time": "2012-05-07T06:27:27Z", "bug_id": 53198, "creation_time": "2012-05-07T06:27:27Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "text": "http://svn.apache.org/r1613066", "id": 176648, "time": "2014-07-24T13:43:44Z", "bug_id": 53198, "creation_time": "2014-07-24T13:43:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
