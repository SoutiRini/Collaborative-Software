I set the severity as an enhancement because there is a simple workaround that doesn't introduce any severity of risk that I'm aware of.\n\nReplicating an install from a RedHat Linux machine to a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, I'm getting the following error when I start the service up:\n\nSEVERE: Failed to initialize end point associated with ProtocolHandler [...]\njava.lang.Exception: Connector attribute SSLCertificateFile must be defined when using SSL with APR\n\nIf I comment out:\n\n<Listener className=\"org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener\" SSLEngine=\"on\" />\n\nFrom the server.xml the service boots up normally. (assuming it's now using JSSE SSL)\n\n\nYou can reproduce this by doing a default install, and attempting to make a connector that uses a pkcs12 keystore. Mine was an exported star cert from a Windows box that I exported into a pfx.(star cert purchased from COMODO) \n\nThe exact setup works fine on the linux box without any issues.\n\nI have talked to a few Colleagues and they all can reproduce the error in their environments.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm missing any pertinent information.\n\nI would look to fix the code, but that is way above my expertise at this time.\nMike."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 56183, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
