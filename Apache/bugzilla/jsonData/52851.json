According to the manual it will decide \"in mod_cgi, the length of time to wait for output from a CGI script.\" However, I wrote a python script containing a very long loop (at least last for more than 3 minutes) before print some strings, and then configure the TimeOut to 1 (second). It turns out that when requesting that python script, the httpd will just keep waiting for the output, and the waiting time is definitely more than 1 second. In addition, after terminate the httpd with apachectl -k stop, the httpd progress is still running for a while.\n\nI do notice that there was another report about this issue https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44270\n\nBut I do send httpd requests, instead of just \"telneting to 80\", and didn't see anything to do with AcceptFilter set.\n\nThanks.\n\nRobert"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52851, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 154663, "time": "2012-03-08T00:18:12Z", "creator": "tixu@cs.ucsd.edu", "creation_time": "2012-03-08T00:18:12Z", "text": "Hi, Robert,\n\nCan you provide your configuration file (so that I can replay it)? \nThanks a lot!\n\nTianyin"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "After enable mod_cgi, just add\n\"\n<Directory \"PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT\">\n     Options +ExecCGI\n     AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .py\n </Directory>\n \nTimeOut 1\n\"\n\nto the httpd.conf file, and start the httpd server.\n\n\n(In reply to comment #1)\n> Hi, Robert,\n> \n> Can you provide your configuration file (so that I can replay it)? \n> Thanks a lot!\n> \n> Tianyin", "is_private": false, "id": 154665, "creator": "rsm219@gmail.com", "time": "2012-03-08T00:58:30Z", "bug_id": 52851, "creation_time": "2012-03-08T00:58:30Z", "attachment_id": null}]
