Choose a web service with at least 2 available methods.\n2. Create at least 2 WebService(SOAP) Requests for this web service (with the same WSDL URL and different methods).\n3. Choose a new value in WebMethod drop down list for one of the requests.\n\nActual Results: All the other requests have this value selected in their drop down lists.\n\nExpected Results: The method selected in one request should not have affected the methods selected in the other requests.
