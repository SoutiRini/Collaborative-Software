Assuming we have the following\n1) Lib X - a common Java class library (JAR) used by the others\n2) App A - a Java class library that uses Lib X, built using its own build script.  Dependency on Lib X is explicitly included.\n3) App B - a Java class library that uses Lib X, built using its own build script. Dependency on Lib X was missed.\n4) Master Build script\n\nIf the Master build script calls the Ant task for App A then App B all works as expected.  If the order is reversed (or if App B build is done directly) the build fails because the Lib X class is not found in the load path.\n\nThe implication is that the class path for the build of App A is influencing the build for App B, even though they don't really have anything in common other than being called from the master script.", "id": 185906, "time": "2015-10-24T01:06:11Z", "bug_id": 58531, "creation_time": "2015-10-24T01:06:11Z", "is_private": false}]
