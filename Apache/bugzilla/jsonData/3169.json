I have been fiddling around with the DBTags and \nfound that rowCount, wasEmpty and wasNotEmpty don't seem to work with resultSet \nLoop False.\n\nI don't know if this is a bug or was it meant to be that way, but it certainly \nwould be nice to have those functions working with loop=\"false\".\n\nThank you and regards,\nDinesh, S.", "id": 4636, "time": "2001-08-19T23:24:17Z", "bug_id": 3169, "creation_time": "2001-08-19T23:24:17Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mdelagra@eb.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 13560, "time": "2002-04-15T03:04:12Z", "bug_id": 3169, "creation_time": "2002-04-15T03:04:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "These tags cannot work in the current implementation when loop=false.  rowcount \ncan only be tracked when the tag controls iteration, and wasEmpty and \nwasNotEmpty is derived from rowcount.
