The larger the file attachment the fewer concurrent processes \nwhich can be run.  For example when running a test with a 25 MB file only 2 to \n3 threads can be started.  When running a 10 MB file you can have up to 8-10 \nthreads.   THis causes a problem because file sizes are growing rapidly and for \nmy system the submissions can be as big 75 MB.  I need to be able to test with \nconcurrent transactions with large file sizes.  Please let email me with any \nquesitons.  My heap size is 256MB."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 31203, "text": "Looking at PostWriter in JMeter, the current approach uses a byte[1024] to read\nin the inputstream and writes it to the output stream.
