Experimental Media Type Values\n\n   A media type value beginning with the characters \"X-\" is a private\n   value, to be used by consenting systems by mutual agreement.  Any\n   format without a rigorous and public definition must be named with an\n   \"X-\" prefix, and publicly specified values shall never begin with\n   \"X-\".  (Older versions of the widely used Andrew system use the \"X-\n   BE2\" name, so new systems should probably choose a different name.)\n\nand from RFC2045, chapter 5:\n    (1)   Private values (starting with \"X-\") may be defined\n          bilaterally between two cooperating agents without\n          outside registration or standardization. Such values\n          cannot be registered or standardized.\n\n    (2)   New standard values should be registered with IANA as\n          described in RFC 2048.\n\nClearly, none of those application/x-whatever already in the \"mime.types\" file\nis nor can be registered at IANA.
