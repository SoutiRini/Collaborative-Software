Right now I only\ncan achieve this by specifying several compilerarg values, like javac1.5,\njavac1.6 and so on, all with the same value. It would be nice to specify\n\"javac1.5+\" or something like this to mean javac version 1.5 and later. Maybe\nyou also want limited ranges, like \"javac1.5-javac1.7\", but I guess once you\nhave two ends, the alternative of listing all versions becomes acceptable."}]
