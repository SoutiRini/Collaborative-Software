IMHO, this behaviour is incorrect if there are one or more\nServerAliases and the request comes in via one of those aliases.  The proper\nbehaviour, I believe, would be to have mod_proxy remember the Host: line for the\noriginal request and use that hostname (rather than ServerName) to rewrite the\nredirect.  \n\nSo as not to break the current behaviour, perhaps an option could be added to\nselectively enable this correct behaviour?", "id": 15052, "time": "2002-04-29T15:40:49Z", "creator": "jonathan.apache@layes.com", "creation_time": "2002-04-29T15:40:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8625, "text": "Have you checked the effect of the usecanonicalname directive on this behavior?\n", "id": 15053, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-04-29T15:49:13Z", "time": "2002-04-29T15:49:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8625, "is_private": false, "text": "\"UseCanonicalName off\" in the VirtualHost did give the expected behaviour. \nPerhaps a note should go in the mod_proxy documentation to refer to the\nUseCanonicalName directive?
