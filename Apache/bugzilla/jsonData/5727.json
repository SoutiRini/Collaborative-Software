[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5727, "text": "I have written a java class that contains the following snippet to generate PDFs\n\nStarter starter = options.getStarter();\ndriver.setRenderer(Driver.RENDER_PDF); \ndriver.getRenderer().setOptions(options.getRendererOptions());\ndriver.run();\n\nThis snippet is called from another class which generates PDFs in groups of 3. \nHowever on most occasions, the 1st PDF creation fails. So only 2 PDFs are \ncreated.\n\n1. Shuffling the order of creation does not solve the problem, so the problem \nis not specific to a particular file.\n2. Creating more PDFs doesnt change the problem, only the first one fails.\n3. The first PDF creation does not always fail though. It only fails about half \nthe times.\n\nI suspect the problem may be related to multiple instances of the driver \nrunning at the same time since I dont reuse the same driver but create new ones \neach time.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\nHrishi", "id": 9429, "time": "2002-01-07T13:54:25Z", "creator": "hbal@iventurelab.com", "creation_time": "2002-01-07T13:54:25Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5727, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 26221, "time": "2002-11-13T19:16:35Z", "creator": "oleg@tkachenko.com", "creation_time": "2002-11-13T19:16:35Z", "text": "I believe thread-safe related problems fixed in cvs. Try it and if it doesn't\nhelp, feel free to reopen the bug."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 5727, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 156080, "time": "2012-04-01T06:57:28Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:57:28Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
