However, there is no easy way to detect where the duplicate \nappenders are. It would be really nice if I could flip some kind of switch (ex: \nset some kind of environment variable) that would cause all appenders to \nannounce themselves, and which loggers they are attached to. This would help me \ntrack down the offending appenders when I have duplicate log entries. The \nannouncements could be part of the log record. This is similar to the C in the \nPatternLayout, except C doesn't include appender info, and only works if the \nconfiguration is read. If I have appenders that somehow get a Basic \nconfiguration, they won't dump out this info."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9506, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\nHave you tried log4j.debug=true this annouces when appenders are attached to \nloggers.", "id": 17501, "time": "2002-06-10T17:21:59Z", "creator": "ceki@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-06-10T17:21:59Z", "is_private": false}]
