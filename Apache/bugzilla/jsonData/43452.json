Upon doing so, we\nnoticed that log4j itself became mavenized and now specifies dependencies such as:\n- com.sun.jdmk: jmxri\n- com.sun.jmx: jmxtools\n\nFor those of us who don't use the jmx features of log4j, this forces us to\neither include com.sun libraries in our artifacts (such as webapps).  As a\nworkaround we can exclude this from our own pom.xmls but since maven provides\nthe optional tag, please consider using it for these com.sun dependencies.\n \nLog4j has existing in public maven repositories for years.  It seems odd that\nthe 1.2.x branch now all of a sudden has extra required dependencies."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 43304 ***", "id": 108515, "time": "2007-09-23T20:27:31Z", "bug_id": 43452, "creation_time": "2007-09-23T20:27:31Z", "is_private": false}]
