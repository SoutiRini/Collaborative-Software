I am \nNOT doing anything else !!!\n\nI monitor memory usage using top and sorting the results by \nmemory. I am looking at the SIZE column.\nWhat I get is an EVER INCREASING memory usage. Something \nlike\n30212\n30220\n31016\n31040\n31576\n\n-------------\nI did try the various suggestions and as far \nas I can tell it is not a pure  memory issue but it probably is a resource issue, maybe a file not closed \nor a socket .......\n\nPlease do not dismiss it as the usual Garbage collect issue, if you keep \nrefreshing the page the memory used will increase.\n\nThanks"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13072, "is_private": false, "text": "I read all your posts on tomcat-user already.
