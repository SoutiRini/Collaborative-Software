[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "chrisw@wolfram.com", "text": "Our setup consists of a CATALINA_BASE that is something different than \nCATALINA_HOME.  With this configuration, we place some jar files into the \nshared/lib directory in CATALINA_HOME.  If we do this, classes in these jar \nfiles _cannot_ be found.  If the jar files are placed in common/lib then the \nclasses _can_ be found.  If we place the jar files in a shared/lib directory in \nCATALINA_BASE the classes _cannot_ be found.  If we do not establish a \nCATALINA_BASE and place the jar files only in shared lib, the classes _can_ be \nfound.  \n\nSo it seems that when you use classes that are shared while using \nCATALINA_BASE, you _must_ use common.  However, this is not true if you do not \nset CATALINA_BASE, you should use shared in this case.  It seems like you would \nwant shared to work for both of these cases.  \n\nAlso it would be helpful if shared was based out of CATALINA_BASE.  The \ndocumentation says that it is based out of CATALINA_HOME.  However, there are \nsome messages that refer to it being in CATALINA_BASE.", "id": 36766, "time": "2003-05-06T17:00:13Z", "bug_id": 19703, "creation_time": "2003-05-06T17:00:13Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 19703, "attachment_id": null, "id": 55977, "time": "2004-04-18T13:17:56Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-04-18T13:17:56Z", "is_private": false, "text": "There have been some recent fixes to the documentation to correct a couple of \nerrors.
