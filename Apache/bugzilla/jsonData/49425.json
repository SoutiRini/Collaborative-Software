There is support for the limited command line length in Ant already but it assumes that this limit is 4096 characters on all platforms, while in the OS/2 version of CMD.EXE it is much less -- about 1023 characters. \n\nThe supplied patch fixes this issue.", "attachment_id": 25580, "id": 137555, "creator": "dmik.for-maillists@hugaida.com", "time": "2010-06-10T16:10:41Z", "bug_id": 49425, "creation_time": "2010-06-10T16:10:41Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "The patch looks reasonable and I'll apply it later today even though I'll be unable to test it.\n\nWhile we have the attention of somebody running OS/2 could I ask you to download http://people.apache.org/~bodewig/ant-env.zip extract the ZIP, run\n\njava -jar ant-env.jar\n\nand report your results to bug 49366\n\nAs background: we want to replace our platform specific environment variable system with System.getenv in the future and need to see whether both approaches yield the same result.", "bug_id": 49425, "is_private": false, "id": 137561, "time": "2010-06-11T00:32:16Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-06-11T00:32:16Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49425, "attachment_id": null, "id": 137564, "creation_time": "2010-06-11T03:34:21Z", "time": "2010-06-11T03:34:21Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "applied your patch in svn revision 953594\n\nPlease try the ant-env.jar as described in comment #1", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49425, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 137566, "time": "2010-06-11T07:21:50Z", "creator": "dmik.for-maillists@hugaida.com", "creation_time": "2010-06-11T07:21:50Z", "text": "Thanks for promptness.
