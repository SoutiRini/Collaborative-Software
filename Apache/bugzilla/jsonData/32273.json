Sometimes heartbeat requests from content switches can drop the\nconnection during this timeframe, as they often just care that the 3-way TCP\nhandshake can complete.\n\nA level of Apache 1.3 after 1.3.19 lowered the severity of the message to debug\nand added the client IP address.\n\nIt is unclear what, if any, connection there is between the setsockopt failure\nand the \"file not found\" errors.  Both of these are common error log messages. \nIt is possible that the connection was dropped *after* the TCP layer buffered\nthe client's request, and the client's request is for an invalid URL, such that\nyou see both logs on the same request.  Use the client IP address logged for the\nfile-not-found error to see where these are coming from, and perhaps why. \nConsider upgrading to current level of Apache 1.3 (and setting LogLevel to\ndebug) to see if client IP address for both messages is the same.\n", "id": 67015, "time": "2004-11-17T14:54:56Z", "bug_id": 32273, "creation_time": "2004-11-17T14:54:56Z", "attachment_id": null}]
