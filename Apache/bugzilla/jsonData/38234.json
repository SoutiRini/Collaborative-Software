Once it happens, JMeter no longer gets healed up\nduring its lifecycle.\n\n> If this works, it would at least be a work-round until the problem is fixed.\nTechnically, you are right.\nI'll be waiting until it's fixed.\n\n\n///////////////////// new case //////////////////////////////\nThe bug appears in simpler situation.\n\nWhat I tried follows below:\n01. Invoke jmeter.bat\n02. Add Thread Group to Test Plan\n03. Set \"100\" to [Thread Group]->[Loop Count:]\n04. Add HTTP Request to Thread Group\n05. Set \"localhost\" to [HTTP Request]->[Server Name or IP]\n06. Set \"8080\" to [HTTP Request]->[Port Number]\n07. Set \"/servlets-examples/servlet/HelloWorldExample\" to [HTTP Request]->[Path]\n08. Add Graph Results to Thread Group\n09. Type in Ctrl-R (that is, [Run]->[Start]) MANY times (*1)\n\nAfter you type in Ctrl-R N times, the program fails (starts being cursed).\nN varies. I don't know why. N I encountered includes (and may not be limited\nto) 1(first time), 16, 18, 24, 28 and 42.\n \n\n  Here, if you leave step 03 so that [Thread Group]->[Loop Count] remains \"1\",\nN is much bigger (Might be infinite. I stopped trying after typing Ctrl-R 100 \ntimes). \n  I introduce my computer's performance in case the problem is performance\n-related(*2). My computer has 1.6GHz CPU and 1.0GByte memory. \nIt used up roughly 750MByte of them when I typed Ctrl-R.\n\n(*1) JMeter asks me to save test plan before running. I set \"hoge.jmx\".\n(*2) May not be appropriate (proper?) usage.
