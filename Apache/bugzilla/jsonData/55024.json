I did add it according to the specifications (http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/excel-help/mirr-HP005209180.aspx):\n\n* Values must contain at least one positive value and\n one negative value to calculate the modified internal rate of return.\n Otherwise, MIRR returns the #DIV/0! error value.\n\nBy the way the above specification is wrong, in an Excel sheet, i discover:\n\nwhen all values are positive, excel return a #DIV/0! -> expected as stated above\nwhen all values are negative, excel return -1 (or -100%) -> not expected but this behavior is implemented now and covered by tests\n\nI also added MIRR formulas to FormulaEvalTest.xls (were missing)\n\nyou can check my changes in revision 1538795"}]
