The\n     full form is \"<n>*<m>element\" indicating at least <n> and at most\n     <m> occurrences of element. Default values are 0 and infinity so\n     that \"*(element)\" allows any number, including zero; \"1*element\"\n     requires at least one; and \"1*2element\" allows one or two.\n\nI think that the black character is mandatory ( with or without a Reason-\nPhrase ) but the Reason-Phrase can be an empty String.\n\nThe bug is that \n\nHTTP/1.1 200 \\n\n\\r\\n\nContent-Type: text/html\\r\\n\nContent-Length: 1158\\r\\n\n\nis returned by the mod_proxy and is not a valid http response message. \n\nThe apache is a 1.3.26 compiled in SUSE linux.\nThe server that generates the http message to be forwarded by the mod_proxy\nis an aplication server that i am developing.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n                                 Ignacio Holgado Mazariegos", "id": 20972, "time": "2002-08-13T16:46:11Z", "bug_id": 11668, "creation_time": "2002-08-13T16:46:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "martin@snowplow.org", "attachment_id": 6211, "id": 36693, "creation_time": "2003-05-05T14:16:09Z", "time": "2003-05-05T14:16:09Z", "bug_id": 11668, "text": "Created attachment 6211\nproxy_util extra-blank-line-fix patch", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11668, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 36694, "time": "2003-05-05T14:22:12Z", "creator": "martin@snowplow.org", "creation_time": "2003-05-05T14:22:12Z", "text": "This is a bug in proxy_util.c - the full details are in the Debian bug tracking\nsystem, but I've also attached a version of the same patch to this bug.\n\nThe attached patch is not the only way to fix it, of course, though it does\nintroduce the smallest amount of new code for any patch I considered, and it is\nvery easy to verify that this patch does not break anything new.\n\nIt may however be more proper to fix it by removing the manipulations of\nbuffer[12] around the atoi call (see the patch), and then replace the atoi call\nwith an equivalent usage of ap_strtol().\n\nNote that several other bugs are in fact duplicates of this bug.\n\nMy Debian bug report can be read at\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=191930"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11668, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 36696, "time": "2003-05-05T14:30:45Z", "creator": "martin@snowplow.org", "creation_time": "2003-05-05T14:30:45Z", "text": "*** Bug 10052 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Looking at the CVS, this was fixed in 1.3.27.\n\nI still think that my patch is better, but it's now a minor performance (and\npossibly code-ugliness) bug, as opposed to a \"breaks with other sites\" bug.\n\nI'll be re-submitting my patch on a new, separate bug.\n", "is_private": false, "id": 36701, "creator": "martin@snowplow.org", "time": "2003-05-05T15:57:55Z", "bug_id": 11668, "creation_time": "2003-05-05T15:57:55Z", "attachment_id": null}]
