[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nThere's a minor bug when saving a graph in JMeter GUI in Listener Aggregate Graph.\nWhen you save the graph to file, the image that is saved does not contains the settings you specified unless you change to Tab \"Graph\".\n\nPossible solution: Invalidate image before saving the image.\n\nTo reproduce do the following steps:\n(I'll consider that you already have a set of data to build the graphic)\n  1. Open Aggregate Graph component\n  2. Open \"Graph\" tab (The graph should be displayed with the default settings)\n  3. Now go back to \"Settings\" tab.\n  4. Change a bunch of visual settings like font size, title, etc... Go nuts..\nDO NOT change back to \"Graph\" tab.\n  5. Save the graph to file with button \"Save\", and save it to disk with any name.\n  6. Open the png and there you go, the new settings inserted are not there.\n\nAny further question do not hesitate to ask.\n\nBest regards,\nDanilo Mendes", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 58329, "id": 184968, "time": "2015-09-04T17:01:39Z", "creator": "ddannillo@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-09-04T17:01:39Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "d.l.coppens@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 33698, "id": 189678, "time": "2016-03-23T21:29:13Z", "bug_id": 58329, "creation_time": "2016-03-23T21:29:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 33698\nPatch for bug 58329"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "d.l.coppens@gmail.com", "text": "Attached patch for this bug. \n\nUpdated getPrintableComponent() method inherited from SaveGraphics component to always draw the graph before providing the graph to be saved.", "id": 189679, "time": "2016-03-23T21:31:48Z", "bug_id": 58329, "creation_time": "2016-03-23T21:31:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 58329, "is_private": false, "id": 189680, "time": "2016-03-23T21:47:47Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-03-23T21:47:47Z", "tags": [], "text": "Date: Wed Mar 23 21:47:27 2016\nNew Revision: 1736381\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1736381&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 58329 - Response Time Graph and Aggregate Graph : Save graph to file does not take into account the settings changed since last click on Graph\nBugzilla Id: 58329\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/components/org/apache/jmeter/visualizers/RespTimeGraphVisualizer.java\n    jmeter/trunk/src/components/org/apache/jmeter/visualizers/StatGraphVisualizer.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml"}]
