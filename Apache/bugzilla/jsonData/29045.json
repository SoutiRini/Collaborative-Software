This is to report \nerrors in a similar way to the exec task.\n\nhttp://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/exec.html\n\nIn the exec task you can assign the error to an error property and let the \nbuild continue. But in the case of copy & move it logs the error and \ncontinues. \n\nWhat i would love in ant would be the error reporting for <move> & <copy> to \nwork in the same way as the <exec> task.\n\nregards\nPaul", "id": 57572, "time": "2004-05-17T20:54:23Z", "creator": "paulnisbett@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-05-17T20:54:23Z", "is_private": false}]
