Sometimes, a page is \"cut\" in the\nmiddle of a table and its header (fo:region-before) is missing.\n\nAs far as we have investigated we can say that:\n\n    * We have neither abnormal output message, nor exception stack\n      trace.\n\n    * We only experience this problem with the AWT renderer.  Using\n      the PCL renderer works fine (but it lacks multibyte characters\n      support that is critical for some of our translated releases).\n\n    * We only experience this problem on a true printer (we have tried\n      several models from HP and OKI).  We never reproduced the\n      problem using a fake printer such as Adobe Acrobat Distiller.\n\n    * With the FO document (bug.fo) that is attached, we experience\n      the problem 20% of the time when launching the printing from our\n      application (we tried both java.awt.print and javax.print APIs).\n\n      When using the `fop.bat' script, we experience the problem 100%\n      of the time with the same FO document.\n\n      fop.bat -fo bug.fo -print\n\n      We tried JDK 1.4.1_07 and 1.4.2_07.\n\n    * So far, 100% of the time it happened, tables were involved in\n      the document.\n\n    * Using the same FO document and the same FOP command line several\n      times may result in having the bug occuring on different pages\n      of the document.  The printing does not fail systematically at\n      the same point of the document.\n\n\nI have attached:\n\nYou can download http://www.guillaumeponce.org/fop/bug.fo.zip\n\n    The reference FO document we have used to investigate this\n    problem (zipped).\n\n\nYou can also download http://www.guillaumeponce.org/fop/bug.pdf\n\nIt is 12 Mb large.
