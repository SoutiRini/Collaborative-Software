[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30945, "text": "Description: \n  When shutting down a Jmeter running in server mode from a Jmeter client in \nGUI mode the server does not shut down the rmi registry.\n\nInitial setup: \n1. Install JMeter on 2 machines.\n2. In the properties file of 1 of the machines add to the remote_hosts property \nthe second machine.\n3. Start the machine that you registered as a remote host as ./jmeter-server \n(Server Mode) and the other as ./jmeter (GUI mode) .\n\nSteps to Reproduce: \n1. With the GUI use the command run->Remote Exit All. Though I belive that this \nwill probably end up with the same result if I use the Remote Exit and choose a \nhost. \n2. Login to the machine that was in server mode and do a ps -ef | grep rmi.\n\nActual Results:\nThe rmiregistry in which JMeter started is still running.\n\nExpected Results:\nWhen JMeter exits it should clean up it's processes.\n\nNote:\nI am not sure if the OS and Platform is relavant but this was done on a Solaris \nmachine. I do not have the time or resources to check this out on other \nplatforms.", "id": 62803, "time": "2004-08-30T19:41:19Z", "creator": "danderson_75@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-08-30T19:41:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30945, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Does it make sense to shut the rmi registry when shutting the server? \nWhat if the registry is also being used for something other than JMeter?\n\nAnyway, how does one stop the registry?\n\nChanging to enhancement.", "id": 63209, "time": "2004-09-08T13:54:29Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-09-08T13:54:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 30945, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Why not to start RMI registry in-process?", "id": 70459, "time": "2005-02-03T14:24:21Z", "creator": "vasiliy.gagin@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2005-02-03T14:24:21Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "As suggested (so long ago!), the registry is now started in-process.\n\nSo when JMeter exits, the rmi registry will be shut down.", "id": 109751, "time": "2007-10-25T13:47:45Z", "bug_id": 30945, "creation_time": "2007-10-25T13:47:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
