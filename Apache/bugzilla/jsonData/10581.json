If you look at excel when a Blue cell is selected the selected cell\nborder color is changed to red. If it normally has a black border then it is\npainted white above the cell selection border. Does that make sense? I would\nlike to use a single call to get an inverse color to paint cells correctly when\nselected.\n\nFor some reason the diff took all of the SVBorder. I dont know why.. (Im a cvs\ndummy!)\n\nDont know what else has changed. I started to look at formatting of the text\nthat is rendered but havent got very far. The progress is commented out in the\nSVTableCellRenderer class.\n\nJason", "id": 19159, "time": "2002-07-09T07:09:08Z", "bug_id": 10581, "creation_time": "2002-07-09T07:09:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 10581, "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 2288\nPatch file!", "id": 19160, "time": "2002-07-09T07:10:06Z", "creator": "jheight@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-07-09T07:10:06Z", "attachment_id": 2288}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jheight@apache.org", "attachment_id": 2324, "text": "Created attachment 2324\nThis patches the SVTableCellRenderer to provide most of the formatting of cells.", "id": 19364, "time": "2002-07-11T22:25:30Z", "bug_id": 10581, "creation_time": "2002-07-11T22:25:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 10581, "is_private": false, "text": "I just added a SVTableCellRenderer patch that allows for the defaulkt \nformatting styles to be rendered correctly.
