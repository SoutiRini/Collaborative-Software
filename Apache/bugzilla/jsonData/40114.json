It's Tomcat version 5.5.26.\nI also changed the platform to Windows Server 2003, it was set to Linux initially.\n\nI am sure others persons have this problem too.\nWe had it on several servers, all running Windows, not always in a virtual machine.\nIt *seems* to happen randomly a short time after having restarted Tomcat, so another restart often fix it. That's probably why it has been ignored for so long.\n\nOriginal issue and mine are for Tomcat 5.5, so it is maybe related to something which has been fixed in earlier versions. \nWild guess: can it be the session ID generator which re-use existing IDs after restart?\n\nIt can also come from a bug in the application, or MyFaces, or... \n\nAny idea?", "id": 138240, "time": "2010-07-07T03:01:23Z", "bug_id": 40114, "creation_time": "2010-07-07T03:01:23Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "With session persistence disabled there is no way Tomcat can be making session scoped beans for a session present before the restart available after the restart.\n\nI'd be looking at application and/or framework persistence mechanisms.", "id": 138497, "time": "2010-07-17T10:15:21Z", "bug_id": 40114, "creation_time": "2010-07-17T10:15:21Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
