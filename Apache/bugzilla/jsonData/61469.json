This file does depend on commons math3.\n\nThe other modifications allow for the evaluation of arrays within the formula evaluation stack.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any changes that need to take place or any other information is necessary.\n\nI apologize for the size of the patch; I have just recently received approval from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to release the code that was worked on all summer.\n\nBest Regards,\nRobert Hulbert", "bug_id": 61469, "attachment_id": 35267, "id": 200509, "time": "2017-08-29T15:48:16Z", "creator": "bob951321@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2017-08-29T15:48:16Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": 35268, "tags": [], "creator": "bob951321@gmail.com", "text": "Created attachment 35268\nNumeric Array Formulas and Matrix Function Test Cases", "count": 1, "id": 200510, "time": "2017-08-29T15:50:11Z", "bug_id": 61469, "creation_time": "2017-08-29T15:50:11Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "text": "Thanks Robert.
