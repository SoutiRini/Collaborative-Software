Tomcat 6.0.35 can also run on Java 7 out of the box, but changing compileSourceVM and compileTargetVM to Java 7 will not work, because ECJ did not support Java 7 until ECJ 3.7.1.\n\nCons: I can't see any reasons (off the bat) NOT to do this. It's possible other people might know of reasons not to upgrade the next version of Tomcat 6 to ECJ 3.7.2."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52925, "attachment_id": null, "id": 154960, "time": "2012-03-15T22:03:12Z", "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-03-15T22:03:12Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 52805 ***"}]
