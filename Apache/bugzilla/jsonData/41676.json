It is rather huge and thus hard to review. In order to get\nit applied please use the following procedure:\n\n1. Split the patch in smaller more consumable chunks (at least into three chunks\nthat address each of the 3 issues you try to solve separately).\n2. Attach the patches here and post them to dev@httpd.apache.org to draw\ndeveloper attention to them and to have a discussion about them.\n3.
