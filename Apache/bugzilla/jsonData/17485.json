The first job contains sheet 0, and the second\njob contains all the other sheets.  When I do Print in Excel and look at\nthe Print Preview, it looks correct.  And, when I do Print in Excel the\npopup page count window shows that I'm printing 3 pages. Evidently, there\nis some character in the stream that my print company's print job control \nsystem is interpreting as a \"job separator\".\n \nA guess that a workaround would be to create a template with the extra\nblank sheets that I may need, and delete the ones that I don't use.\n \nNote: My template file does not contain graphics.\n--Steve\n------------------------------------------\n \nIn Excel, I create an excel .xls file with one worksheet and save it, to be \nused as a template.\n \nIn POI API, I do:\n \nPOIFSFileSystem fs = new POIFSFileSystem(new FileInputStream(\"C:\\\\My \nDocuments\\\\Excel\\\\Template.xls\"));\nHSSFWorkbook wb = new HSSFWorkbook(fs);\n \nI \"get\" the first sheet\nHSSFSheet coverSheet = wb.getSheetAt(0);\nand then I modify it by adding stuff to it.\n \nThen, I add more sheets to the HSSFWorkbook wb, like this:\n \nHSSFSheet summarySheet = wb.createSheet();\nwb.setSheetName(1, \"Summary\");\naddSheetTitle(summarySheet, \"Summary\");\n \nI then write it out:\n     FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(\"PlanningReport.xls\");\n     wb.write(fileOut);\n     fileOut.close();\n---------------------", "id": 32078, "time": "2003-02-27T12:25:48Z", "bug_id": 17485, "creation_time": "2003-02-27T12:25:48Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"text": "weird but too minor to hold up 2.0 -- put off till 3.0", "tags": [], "bug_id": 17485, "attachment_id": null, "count": 1, "id": 41354, "time": "2003-07-24T15:52:03Z", "creator": "poi-support@buni.org", "creation_time": "2003-07-24T15:52:03Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "jheight@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Any chance of the template being attached to this bug report.
