[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48583, "text": "Created attachment 24868\nsource code and patch for the new functionality\n\nThe first column of the log file produced by org.apache.log4j.HTMLLayout (which is an HTML file) is currently number of milliseconds since start of the program, which is difficult for a person to mentally convert into date/time. I have looked at the source code, and it is not possible to configure any parameters to give a date/time in a readable form, so I added the necessary code to support a property \"TimestampFormat\"\n\nI have attached the updated source code for both HTMLLayout.java and HTMLLayoutTest.java test class, as well as the patch output.  Please could these changes (improvements) be reviewed, and if OK incorporated into Log4j?\n\nThanks and regards,\nMichael Kyritsis", "id": 133745, "time": "2010-01-20T13:52:58Z", "creator": "michael.kyritsis@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-01-20T13:52:58Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 24868}]
