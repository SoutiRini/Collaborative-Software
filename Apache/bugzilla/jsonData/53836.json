Just wanted to confirm if it was ever fixed in the later versions. \n\nWe are suspecting a similar issue in our environment with Tomcat 7.0.26 and would like to know the following:\n\nUnder a situation where Tomcat's active jdbc connections = maxActive and maxWait=\"-1\", if Tomcat stops responding, what would be the status of the Tomcat manager application. Will it be accessible? This will confirm if we are hitting this bug or not as the regular application was not accessible during the Incident but Tomcat manager application was accessible. We had to restart the Tomcat instance to fix the situation.\n\nHere's our config:\n\n<Resource name=\"xxxx\"\n        auth=\"Container\"\n        type=\"javax.sql.DataSource\"\n        driverClassName=\"oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver\"\n        url=\"jdbc:oracle:thin:@xxxxxxxxxx:1523:SID\"\n        username=\"some_user\"\n        password=\"xxxxxxx\"\n        maxActive=\"12\"\n        validationQuery=\"SELECT 1 FROM DUAL\"\n        accessToUnderlyingConnectionAllowed=\"true\"\n        testOnBorrow=\"true\"\n        maxIdle=\"10\"\n        maxWait=\"-1\" />"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum where you can ask questions.
