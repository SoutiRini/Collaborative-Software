Assuming in this case that the\nhandlers associated with the root logger also have a threshold of FINE (or\nlower), then FINE log messages passed to the root logger will be output by the\nhandlers (e.g. to the console, or to a file).\n\nWhen using JULI, the \".level = XXX\" directive is ignored. The default logging\nconfiguration for Tomcat sets the threshold for the root logger's handlers\n(1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler and java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler) to\nFINE, so putting \".level = ALL\" should be enough to get all FINE (and CONFIG)\nlog messages sent to the console and log files.\n\nIt doesn't work if JULI is used directly:\n\nLogger log = Logger.getLogger(\"name\");\nlog.fine(\"Some message\");\n\nIt also doesn't work if Commons Logging is used (since the Jdk14Logger just\ndelegates the logging to a Java Logging Logger object - Commong Logging \"debug\"\nis translated into Java Logging \"FINE\"):\n\nLog log = LogFactory.get(\"name\");\nlog.debug(\"Some message\");\n\nThe workaround for this is to explicitly give a threshold for a lower-level\n(package-level, for example) logger, and explicitly list the default handlers\nfor this logger.

AFAICT it is caused by juli's LogManager\nadding the root logger directly to the classloaders map of loggers, instead of\nusing the addLogger() method which performs some configuration.\n\nHere's a patch to the juli source on the 6.0.x tree. It seems to work okay for\nme, but I can see from reading the code that there are other defects with the\nway logging configuration is inherited from classloader to classloader and the\nway configuration is reset.
