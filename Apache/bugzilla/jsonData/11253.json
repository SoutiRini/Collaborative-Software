[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11253, "text": "I am using the ODBC driver of TestTrack Pro (TTP) to access their proprietary \ndatabase. Using MS Access and the TTP driver it works fine. So they think that \nthere is no problem in their ODBC driver.\nHowever, when I use the jdbc-odbc bridge and call the getString function on a \ncolumn which should be a memo field (in MS Access terminology) then that call \ndoes not return and the JVM starts to use all CPU time. The metadata of the \nResultSet indicates that it is a LONGVARCHAR field.\nIf the field is read using an ascii stream in a while loop then it results in \nthe same behaviour. If the stream is used to read equal or less characters then \nthere are characters in the field then all is well. However, the program has no \nway of determining the number of charaters that are present in the field.\nWhy is the bridge not able to determine the size of the field and shouldn't it \nindicate that it is a CLOB?", "id": 20360, "time": "2002-07-29T13:33:30Z", "creator": "h.aaldijk@euronext.nl", "creation_time": "2002-07-29T13:33:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "nagoya@felipeal.net", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 53990, "time": "2004-03-15T04:51:37Z", "bug_id": 11253, "creation_time": "2004-03-15T04:51:37Z", "text": "DBTags is officially a legacy/deprecated taglib, so we won't fix this bug."}]
