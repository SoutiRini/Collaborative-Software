Could we load the GUI hierarchically? Only load gui elements that\nare expanded/opened?\n\nCould we compile the test-plan once only and cache it, sent the compiled plan to\nthe clients. Invalidate the cache if the plan changes at all? Also, we could\nserialize the compiled test, store it with the same prefix name as the JMX, like\ncompiled python scripts.\n\nDo these sound like reasonable considerations?"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 12970, "is_private": false, "id": 36141, "time": "2003-04-25T18:10:49Z", "creator": "mstover1@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-04-25T18:10:49Z", "tags": [], "text": "I loaded a 3 MB .jmx file in 6 seconds with the current code on a 2Ghz pentium 4\nmachine.
