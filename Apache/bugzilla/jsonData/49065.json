[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 25242\nPatch to implement the apr_hash_index_* functions\n\nIn using the apr_hash data structure in Subversion, we've found that we\noften only want the key or value from a hash.  Furthermore, casting\nthe various return parameters has proven cumbersome.  To solve this\nproblem, we've introduced three helper functions to return the key,\nkey length, and value from a hash iterator.\n\nWe've found these functions quite useful, so I'm including a patch to\nadd them to APR proper.  The patch is against trunk, but if possible,\nI'd like to see these APIs backported to 1.5.x.\n\nThis patch was submitted to the mailing list several weeks ago, and\nreceived positive discussion but nobody committed it.  I'm posting it\nhere so that somebody eventually does commit it.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 49065, "id": 135945, "time": "2010-04-07T20:56:54Z", "creator": "hwright@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-04-07T20:56:54Z", "attachment_id": 25242}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 135967, "time": "2010-04-08T15:37:36Z", "bug_id": 49065, "creation_time": "2010-04-08T15:37:36Z", "is_private": false, "text": "committed as r931973"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49065, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Backported to APR 1.5.x in r1462461.", "id": 166226, "time": "2013-03-29T12:47:43Z", "creator": "rainer.jung@kippdata.de", "creation_time": "2013-03-29T12:47:43Z", "is_private": false}]
