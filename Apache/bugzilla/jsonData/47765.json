[{"text": "The documentation for the ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives say they're allowed in the directory context, but it doesn't list any of their limitations such as they aren't allowed in <Directory> or <Files> sections.\n\nPlease update the text for both of these directives stating something like the following:\n\n*ProxyPass is not allowed in <Directory> or <Files> sections.\n*ProxyPassReverse is not allowed in <Directory> or <Files> sections.\n\nOr...\n\nAnother idea would be to update the \"What Directives are Allowed?\" section of page\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/sections.html so it has two new bullets listed as follows:\n\n*The ProxyPass directive cannot be used in <Directory> and <Files> sections.\n*The ProxyPassReverse directive cannot be used in <Directory> and <Files> sections.\n\nI think this documentation update could help better clarify some of the undocumented restrictions that exist for these two directives today.
