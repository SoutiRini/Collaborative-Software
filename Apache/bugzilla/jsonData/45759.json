You should be able to just use the PDFDocument member variable to create a PDFFactory and then call makeLink() to make an internal link\nand then use a PDFRendererContext to get the currentPage object so you are able to call addAnnotation() from within the PDFGraphics2D implementation.  It would be great if you could revise your patch a little.\n\nHope this makes sense :).\n\nAdrian.", "is_private": false, "id": 120456, "creator": "dev@cumiskey.com", "time": "2008-09-08T06:53:19Z", "bug_id": 45759, "creation_time": "2008-09-08T06:53:19Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "My problem is, I have absolutely no experience with Apache-FOP, so atm, everything you try to explain is chinese to me.

That's indirectly what I meant by subclassing the PDFAElementBridge and PDFANode. I've create a counter-proposal for this which moves the link generation into the PDFSVGHandler which is used by the PDFRenderer to create in-page SVGs. Parts of the patch are still from your original patch. What's still missing here is a clean way to track the locations of all FOs with an ID as discussed already. This should really be possible without creating a destination object for each such ID.
