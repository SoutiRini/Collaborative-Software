Here is \nwhat I found.\n\nIn the HOW-TO for the server.xml configuration it tells you to configure your datasource as follows: \n\"Add this in between the </Context> tag of the examples context and the </Host> tag closing the \nlocalhost definition.\"\n\nWell this did not work for me, I could not get the datasource.  After reading posts on the tomcat-user \nmailing list, I put the datasource configuration information within the <GlobalNamingResources> \nsection of server.xml. Under my web app context I put a ResourceLink that looks like this: \n<ResourceLink name=\"jdbc/TestDB\" global=\"jdbc/TestDB\" type=\"javax.sql.DataSource\"/>\n\nIt worked.
