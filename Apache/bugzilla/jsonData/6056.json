There are\nseveral minor problems which you can work your way around but\nthey give a poor impression to the product as a whole. Second\nimportant thing is in point 10/ hence the \"Critical\" severity.\n\nI'm relatively new to Linux so some of the following my be\nfinger problems on my part. Had I not have had previous, and\nvery positive, experience with Tomcat I probably would have\ngiven up by now.\n\nAnyway thanks for all the good work (despite my moans, Tomcat\nis a very, very good product).\n\n1/ I think that the web-apps should be wrapped up with the \nthe main Tomcat RPM as they are needed to run it correctly\n\n2/ The documentation on tomcat-4.0-doc/index.html does not\nmention the RPMs\n\n3/ Readme.txt says that the web apps are included in Tomcat\n\n4/ RUNNING.txt says that you should run startup.sh under Unix.\nOK I'm running Linux but I was surprised not to find it. \nChecking the GnoRPM I found tomcat4 which I guess is what I should\nbe running instead.\n\n5/ Attempting to run tomcat4 says that it can't change dir to \n/var/tomcat4 - right, it doesn't exist. Should I have created \na symbolic link to it?\n\n6/ Does the tomcat4 script really serve any purpose as it would \nbe simpler for maintenance purpose to have just dtomcat4 (renamed\nto tomcat4)?\n\n7/ There is no reference to the TOMCAT_CFG file, as a result the\nfile references an installation by default of /opt/IBMJava2-13?\n\n\n8/ Again I feel it would simpify matters if this file was incorporated\ninto tomcat4, dtomcat4 or server.xml\n\n9/ The tomcat.conf file overrides the JAVA_HOME variable which it\nsays in the document should be set up before tomcat. Effectively\nthe variable is ignored\n\n10/ I really have a big problem with the tomcat install creating \nusers on my machine. This makes all kinds of assumptions as to \nhow I run security on my machine and is just not required to run\nTomcat. I have no idea what the password is but I guess that half\nthe world does and so has access to my machine!!!\n\n11/ The home of the tomcat4 user doesn't exist\n\n12/ Permissions have not been set up correctly for the tomcat4\nuser to access the ..../logs directory\n\n13/ Catalina .out now contains:\n\nCatalina.start: LifecycleException:  null.open:  java.net.BindException: Address\nalready in use\nLifecycleException:  null.open:  java.net.BindException: Address already in use\n\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector.initialize(HttpConnector.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.initialize(StandardService.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.initialize(StandardServer.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start(Catalina.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.execute(Catalina.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.process(Catalina.java)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java)\n----- Root Cause -----\njava.net.BindException: Address already in use\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketBind(Native Method)\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.bind(PlainSocketImpl.java:452)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.<init>(ServerSocket.java:170)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.<init>(ServerSocket.java:121)\n\tat\norg.apache.catalina.net.DefaultServerSocketFactory.createSocket(DefaultServerSocketFactory.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector.open(HttpConnector.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector.initialize(HttpConnector.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.initialize(StandardService.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.initialize(StandardServer.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start(Catalina.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.execute(Catalina.java)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.process(Catalina.java)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java)", "id": 9958, "time": "2002-01-27T18:07:52Z", "bug_id": 6056, "creation_time": "2002-01-27T18:07:52Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hgomez@slib.fr", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Some of problems reported seems are the result of an installation of the \npackage in non-root mode.
