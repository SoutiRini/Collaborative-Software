By now, \none can \"call\" those sub-targets by putting them in the depends argument. \nRecently, I often want to first do some tests for requirements before running a \nlist of sub-targets. Doing so, each subroutine has to have an unless or if \nargument to check on. Ant produces output for each target entered, which \nresults in a large list of target names being printed, also the unless or if \nmatched.\nUsing antcall does not help, as the context is changed and dependencies have to \nbe redone for each sub target.\nHence, it would be nice to have something like <antcall .. newcontext=\"no\"/> to \nstay in the same context. This also includes the inheritXYZ=\"yes\".\n\n.sz", "id": 37057, "time": "2003-05-12T10:44:30Z", "bug_id": 19847, "creation_time": "2003-05-12T10:44:30Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "mbenson@apache.org", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 8988 ***", "id": 67246, "time": "2004-11-19T18:39:22Z", "bug_id": 19847, "creation_time": "2004-11-19T18:39:22Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
