Please do not send them to \nthe list address! Instead, send your message to the correct command address:\n\nTo subscribe to the list, send a message to:\n   <fop-users-subscribe@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nTo remove your address from the list, send a message to:\n   <fop-users-unsubscribe@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nSend mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:\n   <fop-users-info@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n   <fop-users-faq@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nSimilar addresses exist for the digest list:\n   <fop-users-digest-subscribe@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n   <fop-users-digest-unsubscribe@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nTo get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:\n   <fop-users-get.123_145@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nTo get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:\n   <fop-users-index.123_456@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nThey are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request, so you'll \nactually get 100-499.\n\nTo receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345, send an empty \nmessage to:\n   <fop-users-thread.12345@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nThe messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore their content. \nOnly the ADDRESS you send to is important.\n\nYou can start a subscription for an alternate address, for \nexample \"john@host.domain\", just add a hyphen and your address (with '=' \ninstead of '@') after the command word:\n<fop-users-subscribe-john=host.domain@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nTo stop subscription for this address, mail:\n<fop-users-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@xmlgraphics.apache.org>\n\nIn both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When you \nreceive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.\n\nIf despite following these instructions, you do not get the desired results, \nplease contact my owner at fop-users-owner@xmlgraphics.apache.org.
