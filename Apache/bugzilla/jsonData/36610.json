The parser code in mod_headers.c\ndeclares that after a '%' character is read, the next character should be read\nand a handler function should be called. However I don't have a next character...\n\nA possible workaround can be to use something like this:\n\nSetEnv VAT \"25.0%\"\n<Files \"test.jpg\">\n  header set X-MP-Tax \"%{VAT}e\"\n</Files>\n\nBut I think there should be a better solution, or at least a warning in the docs\nnot to use % characters while setting HTTP headers from a .htaccess."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36610, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 79801, "time": "2005-09-12T15:36:51Z", "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "creation_time": "2005-09-12T15:36:51Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 36609 ***"}]
