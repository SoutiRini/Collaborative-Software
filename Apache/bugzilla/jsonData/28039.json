If an \nSSOClusterManager is set, invokes it when changes are made to the SSO entries \non the local cluster node or if the cluster needs to be queried for a non-\nlocal SSO.\n3) An abstract base implementation of SSOClusterManager that concrete \nsubclasses can build upon.\n\nFYI, I have also attached a concrete implementation, a \nJBossSSOClusterManager.  It uses the JBoss TreeCache to \ncommunicate SSO changes across the cluster.  I've tested this in the \nJBoss/Tomcat integration. I know you can't use TreeCache in TC because of \nlicense issues, but thought you might be interested in a concrete \nimplementation.\n\nSorry, I haven't had a chance to look into how Tomcat's own cluster \ncommunication works.  If you're interested in this patch I can look into what \nit would take to implement a TC-only version."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 11041\nproposed patch", "is_private": false, "id": 54855, "creator": "bstansberry@jboss.com", "time": "2004-03-30T06:41:29Z", "bug_id": 28039, "creation_time": "2004-03-30T06:41:29Z", "attachment_id": 11041}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "bstansberry@jboss.com", "text": "Created attachment 11042\nSSOClusterManager implementation for JBoss", "id": 54856, "time": "2004-03-30T06:42:40Z", "bug_id": 28039, "creation_time": "2004-03-30T06:42:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 11042}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "I had started reworking the code, but you were faster.
