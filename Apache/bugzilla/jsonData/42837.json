[{"count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42837, "text": "In our project, we use test log files (.jtl files) to generate a number of \ndetailed reports in which we would also like to embed some information kept in \nthe test plan definitions themselves (i.e. the .jmx files).\nFor this purpose, we need to have a link between these two types of files. \nCurrently, the only (?) such link is provided via the \"testname\" resp. the \"lb\" \nattributes, but this is rather weak as it breaks when the test element names \nare not unique (which happens occasionally in our test plans).\n\nMy suggestion out of this would be to assign a unique ID to each test element \n(for instance a simple auto-incrementing integer) which is stored in the test \nplan file and which can be written out into the .jtl file (via a new setting in \nthe jmeter.properties file).", "id": 105197, "time": "2007-07-09T00:20:14Z", "creator": "jens@voss-ahrensburg.de", "creation_time": "2007-07-09T00:20:14Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
