It would be very nice to be able to set this parameter in the sampler.\n\nI have already started to work on this, attached you will find my work in progress. \n\nCurrently I am unsure on how to correctly implement a list of variable size of name/value pairs (header fields). I suppose my solution will be similar to the Arguments class, can somebody confirm?\n\nMy major concern is: How will the file be loaded and a List (or Map) be created? I know that I have to modify the method SmtpSamplerGUI.configure() but I don't know which method to call on the TestElement. Should I try to cast this element to an SMTPSampler and in there set my List/Map?", "id": 138172, "time": "2010-07-05T10:28:21Z", "creator": "moreira@privasphere.com", "creation_time": "2010-07-05T10:28:21Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 25707}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49552, "text": "I just found out that the SendMailCommand already offers support to setting headers, see SendMailCommand.setHeaders().
