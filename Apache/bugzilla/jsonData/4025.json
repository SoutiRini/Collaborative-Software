In this way, one can keep the comments for a \ngiven target with the target itself, and not in a separate help target, and the \ncomments can be used for both build.xml documentation (instead of <!-- comment \n-->) and at run time to discover targets defined.\n\nFor example,\n\n<target name=\"build\" help=\"Compile source files\">....</target>\n<target name=\"install\" help=\"Install ejbs into weblogic\">...</target>\n\nand if one were to type:\n\nant help\n\nant would respond:\n\nbuild -   Compile source files\ninstall -    Install ejbs into weblogic\n\nThis is especially useful if one is using an XML include to share a template.  \nSome of the targets will be defined in the shared template, others will be \ndefined in the build.xml of the directory.  In this way, the comments of all \ntargets, both shared and local, will be reported when \"ant help\" is executed."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 4025, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 6471, "time": "2001-10-08T12:31:09Z", "creator": "umagesh@rediffmail.com", "creation_time": "2001-10-08T12:31:09Z", "text": "This 'feature' is already there in Ant 1.4 (at least).  You can attach a \ndescription to a target (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/using.html).  \nThis description will be printed out along with the target names when \nant -projecthelp is invoked.\n\nPleas eupgrade to Ant 1.4 if yo uhaven't already and let us know if this \naddresses your enhancement request.  If it does, we can then close this case.\n\nThanks,\nMagesh\n"}]
