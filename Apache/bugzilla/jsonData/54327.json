The subsequent rows' following the header becomes the data for the header cell values. \n\nProblem Statement: In a row if 2nd cell is blank and unformatted but the rest of the cells in that row are formatted, then the 2nd cell is not read and hence the values are messed up. \n\nExample: In the attached excel sheet, cell B4 and B6 are skipped by the cellIterator and thus the header 'Completion Date' has the values of the next columns i.e., M India Limited & Steel in row 4 and 6 respectively. But the same is not true for 5th row. It is read properly though B5 is blank.\n\nPlease let me know the solution at the earliest. Also, the possible way to un-format the entire excel sheet before processing.", "id": 164145, "time": "2012-12-19T11:37:51Z", "bug_id": 54327, "creation_time": "2012-12-19T11:37:51Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "apache@gagravarr.org", "text": "This is expected behaviour, the iterator only processes the cells that are defined in the file\n\nIf you need to fetch all cells, you should use a for loop, and call getCell(columnNumber, MissingCellPolicy) to control how missing / blank cells are handled", "id": 164146, "time": "2012-12-19T11:41:10Z", "bug_id": 54327, "creation_time": "2012-12-19T11:41:10Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
