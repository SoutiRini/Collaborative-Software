[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50288, "attachment_id": null, "text": "When I select a war file to deploy in the \"Select WAR file to upload\" section, the manager will complain and fail to deploy the war if a war with the same name already exists.  This requires me to undeploy my application first.  The problem is, with a large war file, it can sometimes take several minutes to upload.  I'd like to see the manager simply auto-undeploy an existing webapp when the newly uploaded one is finished and ready to deploy.  This will keep down-time to a bare minimum while the webapp is reloaded.", "id": 141781, "time": "2010-11-17T17:59:30Z", "creator": "david@sogeeky.net", "creation_time": "2010-11-17T17:59:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50288, "attachment_id": null, "text": "That is what the update parameter is for when using the text based Manager interface.", "id": 188275, "time": "2016-02-07T19:57:06Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-02-07T19:57:06Z", "is_private": false}]
