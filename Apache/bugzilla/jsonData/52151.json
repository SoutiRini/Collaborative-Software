This is a good idea but setting the system property in the getParameters method probably is a bit too much magic. Plus you have to reset the property afterwards, which is brittle. Maybe the LayoutEngingTestUtils.getLayoutTestFiles method should be overloaded with a parameter that directly sets the test set instead of getting it from a system property.\n\nSmall detail in the junit-compile-copy-resources task in build.xml: by using the '**/*' pattern the Java files will also be copied, which will create unnecessary I/O.\n\nThanks,\nVincent"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 27948\ncode coverage tool\n\nMade the changes requested", "attachment_id": 27948, "id": 151545, "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "time": "2011-11-16T11:44:14Z", "bug_id": 52151, "creation_time": "2011-11-16T11:44:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Patch applied in rev. 1203749:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1203749&view=rev\n\nI made the following changes to jacoco.xml:\n- removed unnecessary ivy namespace declaration\n- removed unused result.jacoco.report property\n- renamed jacoco report dir to report_jacoco to follow the same pattern as the other tools (Checkstyle, FindBugs, etc.)\n- changed classpath of task definition to only include ${jacocoant.jar}\n- removed unused errorproperty and failureproperty from junit task\n- removed unnecessary JUnit formatters: I think we can safely assume that, prior to getting coverage report, 'ant junit' has been run and that tests passed\n- removed unnecessary merging of jacoco execution data since only one file is generated\n- renamed targets to more descriptive names and added description to coverage-report target so that it appears when running ant -p\n- other small clean ups\n\nThanks,\nVincent", "attachment_id": null, "id": 151627, "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "time": "2011-11-18T17:11:42Z", "bug_id": 52151, "creation_time": "2011-11-18T17:11:42Z", "is_private": false}]
