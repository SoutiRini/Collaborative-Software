For example, a message sent using it does \nnot set a \"Date\" header by default.

This causes the build maintainer to \nget many a disgruntled emails from many architects about it not showing up properly in his \n\"Thread\" view of his Inbox.\n\nA good solution would be to add a sub element \"header\" with \nname/value contents.
