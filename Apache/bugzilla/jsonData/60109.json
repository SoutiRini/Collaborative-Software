When nesting is high this increases importantly the numbers\n- Average response time/ Min and Max are also impacted. So you can from summary detect a deviation in response time if you have a TC that contains every other Samplers.\n- Error rate is also impacted being more negative \n\nI suggest adding a new property \"summariser.ignore_transaction_controller_samplers\" which defaults to true (mention the change in release notes). Users can set it to false to revert to previous behaviour."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60109, "text": "Author: pmouawad\nDate: Sun Sep 11 20:08:53 2016\nNew Revision: 1760277\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1760277&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 60109 - Summariser : Make it ignore TC generated SampleResult in its summary computations\nBugzilla Id: 60109\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/bin/jmeter.properties\n    jmeter/trunk/src/core/org/apache/jmeter/reporters/Summariser.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/usermanual/properties_reference.xml", "id": 193637, "time": "2016-09-11T20:09:22Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-09-11T20:09:22Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "is_private": false, "id": 198981, "time": "2017-05-31T07:54:38Z", "bug_id": 60109, "creation_time": "2017-05-31T07:54:38Z", "tags": [], "text": "*** Bug 61139 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}]
