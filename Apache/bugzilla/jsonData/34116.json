Enclosed are the preliminary results of my recent \nexperimentation with defining an XML vocabulary (no DTD or schema, and one \nmight be impossible given the choices I'm made...) with matching XSLs.\n\nThere's a processing instructions so it loads in an XSL compatible browser. The \nHTML files are original Ant ones for comparison. Note that IE garbles the XML \nbecause it does not preserve whitespace-only nodes (needs special setup to load \nconformant XSL engine) and that I did not finish the <ant> XML doc example, as \nI was not expecting such a weird example format.\n\nSo far I've mostly mimicked the existing Ant docs, but once we have semantic in \nthe documentation, we can go crazy with the formatting.\n\nAlso enclosed is a XML+XSL prototype for the WHATSNEW file. Provides neat \nlittle features.\n\nBoth of these are addressing the Ant doc issue from the other spectrum I \nstarted with introspecting the tasks/types from the AntLib definition. This \nwill eventually spit more XML to be merged with the manually maintained docs \n(to complement them).\n\nPlease feel free to comment or ask questions.
