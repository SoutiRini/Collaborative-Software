If you haven't done so already I suggest you enable checkstyle integration with your Java IDE and check the checkstyle report prior to submitting any patches.\n\nNo need to submit a new patch just for checkstyle as I have corrected the checkstyle warnings locally. However, I am wondering why you have placed only the Interface into commons and put the implementations into FOP? Wouldn't it more make sense to put the implementations into commons too. I see they have a dependency on the ColorUtil.toCMYKGrayColor method in FOP, but that could be moved to a super class of ColorUtil that lives in commons. The move should be easy enough as your converter class appears to be the only user of that method.\n\nChris", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 24817\nA ColorConverter interface with some generic implementations", "attachment_id": 24817, "bug_id": 48405, "id": 133447, "time": "2010-01-08T02:30:06Z", "creator": "peter.hancock@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2010-01-08T02:30:06Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "peter.hancock@gmail.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 133448, "time": "2010-01-08T02:32:24Z", "bug_id": 48405, "creation_time": "2010-01-08T02:32:24Z", "text": "Updated patch"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "Thanks for the updated Patch Peter.
