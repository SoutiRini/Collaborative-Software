[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "While testing the TIBCO application using JMS Publisher. Jmeter is creating large number of TCP connections and is effecting the performance of the application. Below is our scenario\n\nI have 40  different messages to test in TIBCO and will be posting these messages into 10 different queues with varied TPS. In order to test , I have created a thread group under the test plan and have added 40 JMS Publisher samplers to the threadgroup . ideally in this scenario if I run with 1 thread , there should only be one tcp connection since I am going sequentially one of after the sampler. However Jmeter is creating 3 connections for every sample and closing 2 connections and keeping 1 connection open till the end of iteration . \n\nSince we have 40 samples to go through it will create 40 connections per 1 thread per 1 iteration and as during the load test we will run with more threads we will end up in creating large number of tcp connections . \n\nIn real world, Connections are fixed and will be reused where as in this case new connection is established every time.\n\n\nRequest you to provide solution for this issue and appreciate you for your time and effort.", "is_private": false, "id": 200181, "creator": "phani.9284@gmail.com", "time": "2017-08-03T20:22:24Z", "bug_id": 61378, "creation_time": "2017-08-03T20:22:24Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61378, "text": "Can you give a sample test plan, that exhibits the described behaviour?
