The valueOf factory methods (e.g. Boolean.valueOf(true)) should always be preferred. Those methods are called implicitly by autoboxing, which is often more convenient than an explicit call. Integer x = Integer.valueOf(23); and Integer x = 23; are equivalent.\n\nThe explicit constructors always return a fresh instance, resulting in unnecessary allocations. The valueOf methods return cached instances for frequently requested values, offering significantly better space and time performance.\n\nRelying on the unique reference identity of the instances returned by the explicit constructors is extremely bad practice. Primitives should always be treated as identity-less value types, even in their boxed representations.\n\nAntonio", "bug_id": 60535, "attachment_id": null, "id": 195718, "time": "2016-12-30T12:10:16Z", "creator": "ra0077@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-12-30T12:10:16Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 60535, "is_private": false, "id": 195719, "time": "2016-12-30T12:15:40Z", "creator": "ra0077@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-12-30T12:15:40Z", "tags": [], "text": "PR https://github.com/apache/jmeter/pull/244 commited"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "ra0077@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 196126, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 60535, "creation_time": "2017-01-17T21:31:11Z", "time": "2017-01-17T21:31:11Z", "text": "Fix commited"}]
