[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hello.\n\nToday I have taken a look to the Nio Connector because the 16000 connections\nnews and I was very sad when I discovered that it hasn't implemented a write\ntimeout, like in the apr connector. In the real world, with very slow\nconnections, connections that don't respond to write operations, APR connector\nbeats Nio Connector by far.\n\nI think, to add this feature could be very easy. \n\nThis feature is very useful so if you don't work in comet mode, then the thread\nthat execute the request could be free in read and write issues. The write\nproblem is more common than you think in real world. I had to change to APR\nconnector because this.\n\nThanks in advance.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 42195, "id": 102089, "time": "2007-04-23T05:08:14Z", "creator": "dcanofr@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2007-04-23T05:08:14Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Can you send a patch?", "is_private": false, "id": 102196, "creator": "pr@objektpark.de", "time": "2007-04-23T23:48:39Z", "bug_id": 42195, "creation_time": "2007-04-23T23:48:39Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Certainly does have a write timeout, it uses the soTimeout value for this, just\nlike you would have on a blocking connection since reading and writing from the\nstreams is blocking\n", "attachment_id": null, "id": 102415, "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "time": "2007-04-25T20:13:01Z", "bug_id": 42195, "creation_time": "2007-04-25T20:13:01Z", "is_private": false}]
