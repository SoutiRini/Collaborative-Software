'undeploy' is opposite of 'deploy' and 'remove' \nis opposite of 'install'. The difference is really between 'deploy' which\nuploads a file to the server and 'install' which works with a file/directory\nthat is already present on the server.\n \n> But for instance, the 'undeploy' command does not work as it validates that \n> the context docbase should be inside the manager working directory, which is \n> quite unlikely to half happen if deployed incorrectly due to PR 28830\n\n'deploy' should put put wars in the appbase\n\n> I will send a complete patch within the next days.\n\nFixing 28830 should fix this since the war will be in the expected place.\nTherefore, I am marking this as a duplicate of 28830.\n\nFYI - Remy has made this a lot better in 5.5.x but I don't propose to back port\nall his changes.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 28830 ***", "id": 69572, "time": "2005-01-11T23:45:26Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-01-11T23:45:26Z", "attachment_id": null}]
