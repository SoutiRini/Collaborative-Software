In fact, if you delete C.java from the source tree and remove the\n\"b/c/**\" portion of the exclude tag, B.java will be properly excluded from the\ncompile.\n\nUsing the excludes parameter instead of the nested exclude tag works correctly.\nSee the \"aonly\" target in the test case's build.xml.\n\nThis bug is present both in the current Ant 1.6.5 as well as in the 1.7.0 beta\n2.
