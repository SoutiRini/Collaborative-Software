Also it worked fine with 1.XX.XX. I am using Zone Alarm \nfirewall and PC Chillin Anti Virus. Do you think it has something to do with it \nor still could be dynamic IP problem?

Usually the \nsystem stops responding to requests.  Apache stops logging events, sometimes \nafter logging an Out of Threads message to the error.log, sometimes not.  \nProcess lists indicate that Apache is taking up all CPU resources.  Process \nmonitoring indicates that the actual child process is taking the CPU.  If the \nlog contains an Out of Threads message, usually the second web server will go \ndown with the same symptoms within 15 minutes or so.  If there is no OOT \nmessage, usually this will not happen.\n\nInfo:\n\tMemory seems steady.  I/O seems OK as well.  No pattern in when these \noccur.  Slightly more likely during the week then the weekend.  HTML requests \nright before this happens are normal requests.  The service will rarely respond \nto NET STOP commands when in this state.  Reboots correct this problem.  Anti-\nVirus has been stopped on the system.  After stopping AV on 11-12, the problem \nhappened several hours later, then not again until 11-18, the longest period \nyet.  Since then, the Patrol has reported 8 various CPU pegs, including the \nfirst one on 11-18.  The Web boxes are Win2K SP2.  Apache is 2.0.42.  We are \nnot able to duplicate this problem in the lab under stress conditions.\n\nSpeculation:\n\tI believe this may be two linked but still separate problems, one, the \nOOT problem, the other, the \"stoplog\" problem.  I say this because with an OOT, \nif threads are not released, Apache will not accept connections, and there's \nnothing to put in the logs.  Also, this issue somehow crosses to the other web, \nwhich soon goes down.  On the other hand, the stoplog problem never crosses to \nanother server, and often the server continues to serve requests after the CPU \npeg.  These requests are not logged, however.  I also believe this to be a non-\nRSM related problem as I feel we would be seeing more regular occurrences or \nduplication in the lab.  Possibly a malformed HTML request.\n\nConclusion:\n\tStopping AV did not fix this problem. \n\nThanks,\nAndrew", "id": 26603, "time": "2002-11-19T18:27:45Z", "creator": "ivelin@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-11-19T18:27:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "c_chandu1975@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 27930, "time": "2002-12-17T03:53:28Z", "bug_id": 13661, "creation_time": "2002-12-17T03:53:28Z", "text": "The same problem is happening with me on Windows 2000 Professional, Apache 4.0.23 and PHP 4.4.0 \ndev.
