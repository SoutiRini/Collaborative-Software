[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44657, "text": "Taken from the example were the Accept-Language (and it qualifiers) HTTP  header is overridden by a cookie set in the user\u2019s browser; from http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/content-negotiation.html#better :\nSetEnvIf Cookie \"lang=(.+)\" prefer-language=$1 Header append Vary cookie\n\nI wish this could be done this be done with other Accept HTTP headers as well. By introducing other enviromental variables\u2014such as prefer-type, prefer-encoding, and prefer-charset\u2014they can be used to override other default  negotiation methods for the Content-Type, Content-Encoding, and Content-Charset headers. I had visioned something like the below:\nSetEnvIf Cookie \"type=(.+)\" prefer-type=$1 Header append Vary cookie\nSetEnvIf Cookie \"charset=UTF-8\" prefer-type=utf8 Header append Vary cookie\n\nBasically I want to offer the user a way to override the default content negotiation method. Like with the prefer-language option. For web browsers that does not spesicfy supported charsets, types, encodings, etc.\n\nI mean to put an option to set override cookies on the 406 error ducoument page. So users can fill in the blanks for their browsers.", "id": 114871, "time": "2008-03-22T14:43:32Z", "creator": "aleksandersen+issues.apache.org@runbox.com", "creation_time": "2008-03-22T14:43:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
