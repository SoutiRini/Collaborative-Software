[{"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11845, "text": "Hi,\n\nI have a complex web application running on a Tomcat Standalone with the \nstandard HTTP-Connector. The session timeout is set in the web.xml to 120. \nSometimes the session timed out after only a few minutes. Normally it works \nwithout any problems. When the timeout occurs I haven't made any changes on the \nserver (copying classes JSP'S, ...)\n\nThis is an extract from the access log:\n192.168.192.103 - rootadmin [19/Aug/2002:14:57:38 \n1000] \"GET /proB/jsp/rbac_objects/companyUserList.jsp?oid=133 HTTP/1.1\" 200 1073\n192.168.192.103 - - [19/Aug/2002:14:59:33 \n1000] \"GET /proB/jsp/containers/htmlTree.jsp?cmd=4&oid=10_133 HTTP/1.1\" 302 654\n\nThe user hasn't closed the browser. I see no reason why the session times out.\n\nI know that's not much information for searching a bug. But I can't reproduce \nthe problem. It only occurs sometimes (about 1 from 100 sessions). \n\nBest regards,\nMartin Hengesbach", "count": 0, "id": 21354, "time": "2002-08-20T07:20:57Z", "creator": "martin@mhengesbach.de", "creation_time": "2002-08-20T07:20:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "medthomas@ntlworld.com", "text": "Sorry, there just isn't enough information here to debug this issue.
