When you specify the \"-r\"\noption, that means the test is being sent to a remote server and then\nrun, but the remote server knows nothing about the jmeter property\nvalues on the client machine.  At run time, __P is evaluated, no such\nproperty is found, and the default is used.\"\n\n*** Description of bug\nI am having a problem with JMeter not reading from the command line when using \nthe \"-r\" option.  For example, setting the Thread Group's \"Number of Threads\".  \nHowever, it will use the default value specified in the ${__P()} function.\n \nWhenever I remove the -r option from the command line my JMeter reads the \ncorrect value specified on the command line. \n \n*** Here is an example of my JMeter script.\n TestPlan\n        |\n        -Thread Group  [ Number of Threads =  ${__P(group1.threads,5)} ]\n                    |\n                    --HTTP Request Defaults  [ Server Name = (${__P\n(serverName,)}) ]\n                    |\n                    --HTTP Request\n                    |            |\n                    |            ---Response Assertion\n                    |\n                    --Aggregate Report\n \n \n*** Here is the command line to start the JMeter script.\njmeter -n -t C:\\Test.jmx -JserverName=%1 -Jgroup1.threads=%2 -l %SCALA_RESULTS%\\\n%Results%%2.csv -r\n \n*** Here is the results of the script from the console window\n Created the tree successfully\n Configuring remote engine for 10.180.77.61\n [Full GC 6508K->668K(396544K), 0.0571472 secs]\n Starting remote engines\n Remote engines have been started\n Tidying up ...\n ... end of run\n \n *** However it uses the default value for the threads, which is specified in \nthe jmx file.
