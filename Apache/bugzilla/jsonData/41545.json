JMeter will continue\nto run under 1.4.  However if you want to use the soapUI functionality then you\nwill need 1.5 or higher.  I will update the attachments with a jar compiled with\n-source 1.4 and -target 1.4 as well as the source with the modified build.xml\n\n\n> \n> Also, will JMeter then run without the soapui jars?\n\nYes JMeter will run without the jars, this patch simply adds functionality to\nhelp generate a request.  It does not save anything extra to the jmx file or\nmake any calls after a test is started.\n\nThanks!"}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41545, "text": "Created attachment 19521\nupdated src to include target and source of 1.4", "id": 98991, "time": "2007-02-05T15:12:55Z", "creator": "shahs@yahoo-inc.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-05T15:12:55Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 19521}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41545, "text": "Created attachment 19522\nupdated binary to target jdk 1.4", "id": 98992, "time": "2007-02-05T15:14:02Z", "creator": "shahs@yahoo-inc.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-05T15:14:02Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 19522}, {"count": 9, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41545, "attachment_id": 19530, "id": 99022, "time": "2007-02-06T09:36:56Z", "creator": "shahs@yahoo-inc.com", "creation_time": "2007-02-06T09:36:56Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 19530\nupdated (cleaned up) patch for jmeter src"}, {"count": 10, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41545, "text": "Created attachment 28464\nUpdated patch to r1293562\n\nHello,\nI updated patch and also classes that bridge SOAP UI.\n\nThis patch can ease Soap methods testing since SOAP-UI generates really good templates.\nBridge has Compilation dependency on SOAP UI so I don't think it can be included in JMeter but other classes work without it.\n\nImplementation of bridge must implement org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.gui.WSDLToSoapRequestGenerator\nand implementation is configured in jmeter.properties:\n-soap_request_generator\n\nSo it could be anything, not just SOAP UI.\n\nTesting it patch seems useful to me.\n\nI can host the bridge code somewhere if it cannot be included in JMeter.\n\nShould I commit it ?\nThanks \nRegards\nPhilippe", "id": 154892, "time": "2012-03-13T23:29:19Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-03-13T23:29:19Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 28464}, {"count": 11, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41545, "attachment_id": null, "id": 154896, "time": "2012-03-14T07:54:18Z", "creator": "milamber@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-03-14T07:54:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Hello,\n\nSOAP/XML-RPC Request is an old sampler for Webservice in my opinion, WebService(SOAP) Request seems better and brings several functionality for message.
