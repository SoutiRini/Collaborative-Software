In that case the body is not decompressed and the 'Content-Encoding: gzip' is still present a hint that the deflate module does not take place I suppose.\n\nI have prepared a test suite (attached) to reproduce the problem. It requires mod_deflate and mod_filter to be already enabled. It also requires PHP to see the dumped variables.
