Although this is the case for most headers, Content-Security-Policy is a notable exception, and one for which merged configurations are not unlikely (since different directives may have different stakeholders and be configured in different places).\n\nIt would be great if the append and merge actions provided a way to support such headers, either by providing a way to specify the list separator (such as treating the replacement argument as separator for these actions), or by changing behavior based on the header name.\n\nIf neither of those solutions is acceptable, perhaps adding a note to the documentation about how to use edit to emulate append or merge would be appropriate.  It's pretty straight-forward, but requires a bit of care in the regex to avoid errors and using setifempty before edit to ensure the header is set.   I documented the procedure I am using at https://kevinlocke.name/bits/2015/10/02/setting-content-security-policy-with-mod_headers/ which may be useful for comparison.\n\nThanks for considering,\nKevin"}]
