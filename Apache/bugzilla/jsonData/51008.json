I have committed it your patch in revision 1095076. Although I noticed in testing that page citations that reference IDs on page-sequence don't work. This is unrelated to your changes as I confirmed this is also the case when using page-number-citation. Therefore this particular bug is now closed.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris"}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51008, "attachment_id": null, "text": "batch transition to closed; if someone wishes to restore one of these to resolved in order to perform a verification step, then feel free to do so", "id": 155468, "time": "2012-04-01T06:17:42Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T06:17:42Z", "is_private": false}]
