In my opinion the check that is used for that validation is not complete.\nI would like to propose a patch (attached) that introduces additional checks in order to guarantee that the corresponding method is really suitable to be an injection target.\n\nI'm looking forward to your commends.\n\nBest Regards\nVioleta Georgieva"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53180, "text": "Patch looks good to me.
