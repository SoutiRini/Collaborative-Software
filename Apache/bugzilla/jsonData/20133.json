The load balancer is listening on port 80 but the servers are listening on port 7001.\n\nThe server responds differently if the URL includes a port number.  Since requests to the default port (80) don't need to include port number I thought I'd log it as a bug to see if you'd fix it.\n\nThanks for fixing it--it will make our testing easier.  BTW, we really like and use Jmeter here in the Netflix QA department."}]
