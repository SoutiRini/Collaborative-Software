Actually we are using specific connections but some how all the connections are utilized. If any new request come then it is unable to fetch a connection because pool is empty. But in real case there is no chance of using that much of connections parallel\nSo as per our analysis following are our observations.\nWe are using max idle connections are 30 , but if we do the operations and calculate the connections using Jconsle then IDLE connections are more than 30.\nPlease find attached screenshot for your reference.\nAnd Please let us know is there any solution for this issue.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nThanks\nDillesh", "attachment_id": 35057, "id": 199204, "creation_time": "2017-06-15T08:10:29Z", "time": "2017-06-15T08:10:29Z", "creator": "dillusklm@gmail.com", "bug_id": 61187, "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 61187, "text": "Comment on attachment 35057\nPlease find the attached screenshot for more details\n\nPlease update to latest 7.x and try test again.
