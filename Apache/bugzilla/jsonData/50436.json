Ie : if VirtualHost is given fqdn as argument(s), and no ServerName is explicitely set, why not just accept VirtualHost argument(s) as ServerName (and ServerAliases) ?\n\nI can tell that people not reading much (or not reading at all) the documentation will finally have vhosts working at first attempt.\n\nOf course, does not mean that the sane way to go (use IPs or * for VirtualHost, set a ServerName) should not remain supported...\n\nMy 2 cents,\n\nVincent"}]
