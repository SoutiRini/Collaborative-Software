However, the app crashes approximately twice a day \nwithout any trace. Nothing in jasper.log or servlet.log.\n\nCan the machine load cause Tomcat to crash without any exceptions logged?\n\nPlease can you point me to some \"known\" bugs and fixes, tuning tips or \napproaches to find the problem.\n\nThanks,\nRavi.", "id": 5980, "time": "2001-09-24T16:14:34Z", "creator": "rsundaar@cysive.com", "creation_time": "2001-09-24T16:14:34Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "cmanolache@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 6023, "time": "2001-09-25T13:40:12Z", "bug_id": 3802, "creation_time": "2001-09-25T13:40:12Z", "text": "Most likely it's a JVM problem. Make sure you have the latest patches for the OS, and the latest VM ( or latest stable VM ). There is nothing we can do in tomcat to 'crash' a vm - if any java code will crash the VM, the bug is in the VM ( and it can happen at any time, including user code )"}]
