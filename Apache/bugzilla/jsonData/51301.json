FOP in fact creates a PDF/A-1b file, but verifying it's PDF/A compatiblity using Adobe Preflight 9 or Intarsys PDF/A Live! (http://www.intarsys.de/pdfa-check) issues an error regarding \"EOL sequences before/after keywords\".\n\nDiscarding the bookmark-tree from the (XSL-)FO file fixes the compatibility issue.\n\nThe attached ZIP-file contains the sample FO file \"bookmark_error.fo\" and the corresponding FOP v1.0 generated PDF/A-1b result \"bookmark_error.pdf\" that fails PDF/A compatibility checks.
