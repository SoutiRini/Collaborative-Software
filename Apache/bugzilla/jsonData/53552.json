The missing section seems proportional to the length\nof the \"The Apache2.2 service is running.\" message. \n\nThe two statements about starting the service do not appear at the console\nwhere it would seem most beneficial to have them, and having them go to the\nerror log seems to cause a conflict with the usual initial statements being \noutput to the log.  \nIt seems like they should appear at the console to provide feedback there, \nsimilar to the two statements that appear there to provide feedback when\nstopping the sevrice from the cmd-line via:\n bin\\httpd.exe -k stop -n Apache2.2\neg:\n \"The Apache2.2 service is stopping.\n  The Apache2.2 service has stopped.\"\n  \nThe two service start messages appear to have possibly been created to mimic\nthe two statements that appear at the console if the service is started via\n'net start Apache2.2', eg:\n \"The Apache2.2 service is starting.\n  The Apache2.2 service was started successfully.\"\nyet the Apache service start messages only go to the log file.\n\nIf they are intended for the log file for some reason, then it is currently being done in such a way as to cause some corruption.", "id": 160674, "time": "2012-07-16T17:44:32Z", "bug_id": 53552, "creation_time": "2012-07-16T17:44:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "trawick@apache.org", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 45487 ***", "id": 160797, "time": "2012-07-22T22:00:46Z", "bug_id": 53552, "creation_time": "2012-07-22T22:00:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
