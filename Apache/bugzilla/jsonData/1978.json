For example it is necessary for using\nxlink with XML Schema. Trying this I found the problem.\n\nIf you need the complete example files please ask for them and I will send them.\n\nBest regards\n\nThomas"}, {"count": 1, "text": "I've applied a fix to CVS which solved another problem which appears to be very \nclosely related (perhaps identical to) this one.
