[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "owen.farrell@gmail.com", "text": "With the changes in r1545288, any application that comes packaged with a context.xml deployment descriptor requires a context-specific deployment descriptor be present. While I understand the desire to improve security, it still seems practical to inherit the default context.\n\nMost IDEs that integrate with Tomcat will automatically generate an empty context.xml. Some applications (like Artifactory) come with a minimalist version.\n\nIs there any way to account for both scenarios? Maybe adding a new host attribute that allows the default context to be used. Or maybe the HostConfig implementation could be improved so that only security-specific elements are accounted for.", "id": 177686, "time": "2014-09-09T16:32:07Z", "bug_id": 56937, "creation_time": "2014-09-09T16:32:07Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 56937, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Subscribing another person to automatic e-mail notifications without that person's explicit consent affects your karma quite negatively.\n\nYou can always explicitly configure <Host deployXml=\"true\"> so that app-provided deployment descriptors were honored.", "id": 177689, "time": "2014-09-09T19:36:30Z", "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-09-09T19:36:30Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "owen.farrell@gmail.com", "text": "Mark - Sorry for the spam.
