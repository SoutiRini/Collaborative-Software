This has othe minor side-effects (new versions of jars \ncan only be used after shutdown) but improves the overall development speed significantly. For a \ncomplete description of the behaviour implemented in Glassfish see the provided URL.\n\nPlease consider implementing a similar behaviour in tomcat. thanks :-)\n \n"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "remm@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 95096, "time": "2006-10-26T01:23:36Z", "bug_id": 40812, "creation_time": "2006-10-26T01:23:36Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I think this behavior is useless, so no."}]
