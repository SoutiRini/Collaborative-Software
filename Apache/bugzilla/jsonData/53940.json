The use of OCSP can help this issue to be amortized. However, the issue comes back again when the CRL expires, and Apache Tomcat refuses to complete any more requests because of the expired CRL.\n\nWith this patch, it is possible to reload the new CRL when the previous one expires. For more information about the patch please have a look at: http://code.uoa.gr/p/tomcat-ocsp/reload.php\n\nIt would be nice to include it in tha main Tomcat Tree, since together with the OCSP support, it is possible to have fast and stable cert verification to be used with client authentication.", "id": 162435, "time": "2012-09-27T14:54:00Z", "bug_id": 53940, "creation_time": "2012-09-27T14:54:00Z", "is_private": false}]
