In doing so, I have \nalso updated jsch to jsch-0.1.31 from jsch-0.1.24.  I use the scp task to \ntransfer files from a Windows 2000 server to a UNIX server.  The files are in \na directory structure and they are transferred to an identical structure.\n\nI believe what is happening is in this sequence:\n1) files in directory \"A\" are transferred to UNIX directory \"A\".\n2) files in directory \"A\\B\" are transferred to UNIX directory \"A/B\".\n3) files in directory \"A\\C\" are suppose to be transferred to UNIX \ndirectory \"A/C\", but this never happens.  The transfer hangs.\n\nI believe that the scp transfer is having a problem transferring to the next \nsubdirectory.  It is irrelevant what subdirectory that is.\n\nAlso what I have found:\n1) Ant 1.6.5 with jsch-0.1.24 works.\n2) Ant 1.7.0 with jsch-0.1.24 works.\n3) Ant 1.7.0 with jsch-0.1.31 does not work.\n4) Ant 1.7.0 with jsch-0.1.31 with scp parameter sftp set to \"yes\" works.  \n\nThere is no reason for scenario #3 not to work in our environment.  This is \nwhay I am submitting this as a bug.\n\nLarry Kriv\nlarry.kriv@eds.com"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41465, "attachment_id": null, "id": 98528, "time": "2007-01-25T14:41:19Z", "creator": "ymnk@jcraft.com", "creation_time": "2007-01-25T14:41:19Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please refer to the following bug report,\n  http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41090\n\nIf you can not use the nightly build of ant,\ntry to add 'sftp=\"true\"' to scp task.\n"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "sftp=\"true\" is exactly what I am using now to get around this problem.
