It is extremely inconvenient that they do not work for directories. Because of this apache cannot easily present filesystem view with unix permissions.\n\nIt would be very convenient to modify the mod_authz_owner to handle directories in the same way. \nThen, if directory owner (or group) matches - show the directory listing."}]
