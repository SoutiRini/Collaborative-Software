If the latter produces no files (because no nested FileSets are specified) the warning is issued even if there is a resource collection.\n\n\nRELATED ISSUE\n\nBug 43946: manifest-only jars are broken - whenmanifestonly has no effect", "id": 128490, "time": "2009-07-03T04:53:49Z", "creator": "hoffmann@mountainminds.com", "creation_time": "2009-07-03T04:53:49Z", "is_private": false}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 47470, "text": "doesn't seem to be a problem in trunk anymore, the AntUnit test I added in svn revision 792943 passes.\n\nMost likely it has been fixed via Bug 39426", "count": 1, "id": 128718, "time": "2009-07-10T06:26:52Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-07-10T06:26:52Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "hoffmann@mountainminds.com", "text": "Thanks Stefan!
