During \nthe recent update to 2.0.40, I discovered that the Apache services on Win32 \nwill not install as long as CommuniGate is running on the same server. The \ninstall completes but the Apache server refuses to start with no error in event \nlogs or /log/error. The Apache service does not appear in the MMC \"Services\" \nsnap in or in the Task Manager as running. If CommuniGate pro is stopped before \nattemting to install Apache the services are installed & started correctly. \nComminiGate will also need to be stopped before Apache server is \nrestarted/started. This may or may not be version specific as CommuniGate has \nonly recently been installed on the server.", "id": 21238, "time": "2002-08-18T20:23:49Z", "creator": "randall@johnsoncpu.com", "creation_time": "2002-08-18T20:23:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11806, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 21246, "time": "2002-08-18T20:44:07Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-08-18T20:44:07Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 8925 ***"}]
