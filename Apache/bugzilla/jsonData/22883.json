[{"text": "Apache ANT 1.5.4 has within it a number of useful Operational Tasks. One of \nwhich is called pvcs it can be used to extract files from PVCS Version Manager \n(VM)basically by front ending the VM PCLI \"GET\" command.\nThe ANT pvcs Operational Task has a number of parameters which can be used with \nit. However it has no parameter to allow the extraction of files directly to a \ndirectory. You can only extract files to a VM Workspace. The VM Workspace must \nhave been previously created in the VM GUI. What we and I guess most people \nwould like to do have the option to extract files directly to given directory \nwithout having to remember to go into the VM GUI in advance and create the \nWorkspace.\n\nPlease could this feature be incorporated into a future release of Ant.\n\nAndrew.", "tags": [], "creator": "Andrew.J.Fletcher@rbs.co.uk", "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 43599, "time": "2003-09-02T13:19:52Z", "bug_id": 22883, "creation_time": "2003-09-02T13:19:52Z", "attachment_id": null}]
