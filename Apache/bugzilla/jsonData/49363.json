[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49363, "text": "Hi Team,\n\nA chunked encoding buffer overflow vulnerability was found on an our Apache server. The HTTP specification (RFC 2068, section\n3.6) requires web servers to allow a client to break up a request into multiple sections of a specific length. The Apache HTTP\nServer has a software flaw that misinterprets the size of the incoming data chunks. If exploited, a remote attacker may be\nable to execute arbitrary commands on the host running the vulnerable software. \n\nThough we use a higher version of Apache, i.e 2.2.11. We found this exception in our WebInspect Report.\n\nCould you please confirm if this bug has been fixed for this version 2.2.11.\nAs we have gone through the site and confirmed that its fixed in httpd 2.0.37. http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_20.html \n\nPlease find the attached WebInspect Report for your refernce.\n\nPlease email me your recoomendations & confimation on Priya.Padige@ge.com\n\nThankyou,\nPriya", "id": 137223, "time": "2010-05-30T23:57:45Z", "creator": "Priya.Padige@ge.com", "creation_time": "2010-05-30T23:57:45Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49363, "attachment_id": 25497, "id": 137224, "time": "2010-05-31T00:00:54Z", "creator": "Priya.Padige@ge.com", "creation_time": "2010-05-31T00:00:54Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 25497\nWebInspect Report - Apache 2.2.11"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 49363, "attachment_id": null, "id": 137225, "time": "2010-05-31T02:17:46Z", "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "creation_time": "2010-05-31T02:17:46Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Your URL doesn't resolve (unknown host), and your attachment is a Word document.
