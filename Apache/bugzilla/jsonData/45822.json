There are some inconsistencies between PS/PDF and AFP as to how these borders are drawn. There are a couple issues here:\n1) For dashed borders the \"dash\" and the white-space between are the same length. This may seem trivial but doesn't quite look right, and isn't the same behaviour as XEP. (This applies to PS/PDF and AFP.)\n2) Since PS/PDF have almost identical code (duplicated) for this function (and other methods), there really should be proper centralisation to prevent duplication. Since both PDF and PS classes inherit from BorderPainter.java, if we create a class to sandwich in between this inheritance stack it could contain utility methods such as this. So it will be: BorderPainter->AdobeBorderPainter then either PS/PDF-BorderPainter.\n\n\nI'll make a slight change how both of them draw the borders (the change will make them behave the same). Currently the ratio between dash-whitespace is 1:1, this is implicitly a \"magic number\".
