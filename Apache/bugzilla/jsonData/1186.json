I ,for example, defined all the servlets that I would like \nto preinitialize inside the web.xml for webapp. However, I do get the same \nbehaviour as the reporter does. I do not use any JSPs. Mine are only servlets. \n\nCould you elaborate your explanation above? What do you mean by one explicitely \nand one from invoker? and what is the solution to preinitialize servlets only \nonce in that case if this is not a bug?\n\nthanks", "is_private": false, "id": 20221, "creator": "bora123@yahoo.com", "time": "2002-07-26T00:46:34Z", "bug_id": 1186, "creation_time": "2002-07-26T00:46:34Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "Ok, Now I got it.\n\nIn this case, instead of calling servlets with their actual class names, we \nwill use the the value given by <servlet-name></servlet-name> to prevent it \nfrom reinitializing.
