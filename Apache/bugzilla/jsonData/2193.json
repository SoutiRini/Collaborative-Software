Tomcat4 beta 5 doesn't appear to be using relative paths.

Instead, \nroot\\dir1\\file1.jsp should be included unless I specifically point to file1.jsp \nin the root like the following:\n\n<%@ include file=\"\\root\\file1.jsp\" %>"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2193, "text": "New Information\n\nThis defect is more complex than I initially thought. The problem that I see is \nreplicated when you include a file, and the included file includes another \nfile. Otherwise, the defect is not displayed. My original defect report does \nnot take this into consideration, and testing under the circumstances that I \ndescribed will not display the defect.\n\nTo see the defect, create this hierarchy of directories and files:\nroot_directory_of_webapp\\\n test2.html\ndir1\\\n test.jsp\n test1.jsp\n test2.html\n\nIn test.jsp, use the include directive to include test1.jsp. \nIn test1.jsp, use the include directive to include test2.html like this:\n\n<%@ include file=\"test2.html\" %>\n\nWhen you view test.jsp, you will see the contents of test2.html from the root \ndirectory. However, if you specify file=\"/dir1/test2.html\", it is included \nproperly. \n\nFor some reason, the second include doesn't use the relative path.", "id": 3127, "time": "2001-06-20T10:27:10Z", "creator": "garrel@more.net", "creation_time": "2001-06-20T10:27:10Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2193, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 2543 ***", "id": 3563, "time": "2001-07-10T12:12:54Z", "creator": "justyna.horwat@sun.com", "creation_time": "2001-07-10T12:12:54Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
