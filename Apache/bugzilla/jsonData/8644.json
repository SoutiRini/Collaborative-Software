This is not a bug in Tomcat, it is a problem in\nyour servlet.  MySQL has a limit for how long it will keep an idle db\nconnection open, the default is 8 hours.  Your code never tries to reopen\nthe db connection if it gets closed from the db side.  You might consider\nusing a db connection pool instead of your own code for managing db connections.\nFor further assistance please use the tomcat-user list."}]
