I simply meant that it is good practice to supply a test file for every code change. Regardless of the affect the change has. If I make up a test file I may get very different results from you, and if I perceive no performance improvement then I would be reluctant to commit the change. If however, we use the same test file, then our results should be aligned. Do you see what I mean? Of course, it would be prudent for any developer to try out multiple test files, not just 1, but I still think it would be useful for you to provide a test XSL-FO.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to comment #3)\n> Chris,\n> \n> It's not a bugfix neither new feature, but a performance patch.
