I currently \ngenerate javadoc by using the \"exec\" task as follows:\n\n    <target name=\"javadoc\" depends=\"prepare\">\n        <delete dir=\"${build}/doc/api\"/>\n\t<exec executable=\"${myenv.JAVA_HOME}/bin/javadoc\" >\n\t<arg line=\"@doclet-build.ins\"/>\n\t<env key=\"classpath\" path=\"${classpath}\"/>\n        </exec>\t\n    </target>\n\nI want to change this to use the javadoc task, but still use doclet-build.ins, \nand I can't figure out how to make this work properly.  What is the right \nusage?  Seems I've tried a million permutations and they always give:\n\nNo source files and no packages have been specified.\n\nRegards\n\nEric Kaplan"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "If you really already have all your packages listed in doclet.ins you are not\ngoing to gain anything by using <javadoc> instead of <exec> - well, <javadoc>\ndoesn't need the javadoc executable in the PATH, but that's pretty much all.\n\nYou must give <javadoc> at leas one source file or package name to chew upon\nas it really has been invented for a more dynamic system than yours.
