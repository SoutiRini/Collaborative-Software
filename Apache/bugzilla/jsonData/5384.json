Sun's Joshua Bloch's Item 17 \nof his excellent book \"Effective Java\" is titled \"Use interfaces only to define \ntypes.\"  This is good advice for anyone providing code for public use.\n\nMy proposal is to change the constants interface into an uninstantiable class \nwith public constants, and all the references to the constants will have to be \nchanged to reference it's constants.
