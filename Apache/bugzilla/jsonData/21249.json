Unfortunately,\nthere are no getter methods on the javadoc task, so I can't determine what\nvalues werre set in the javadoc task.  As a result, the only way I can run the\nDocCheck doclet is to set the doclet, the doclet path, and the output directory\non the existing javadoc task, the execute() the task again.  This works in some\ncases, but the DocCheck doclet fails when there are \"-list ...\" options passed\nto the javadoc command.
