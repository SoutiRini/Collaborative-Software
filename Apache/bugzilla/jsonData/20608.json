The WAR file has context.xml in the \nmeta-inf directory.\n\nBut when I deploy the app by putting the WAR file in the TOMCAT_HOME/webapps \ndirectory, the app fails because the JDNI data source isn't bound.\n\nThere's a workaround I found at O'Reilly:\n\nhttp://oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/14252\n\nHowever, it would be nice if the app could get the context.xml info if it finds \nit in the WAR file's meta-inf directory.  No steps required beyond dropping the \nWAR file into the webapps directory.
