I wrote a simple servlet using Jason Hunter's \ncom.oreilly.servlet.MultipartRequest to allow file uploads using https.  My \ntests were with a small jar file and it seemed to work fine.  Then when I \nstarted testing with larger files, an excel spreadsheet and a pdf file, the \nservlet began to throw an IOException - unexpected end of part.  I tried \nrunning the servlet standalone and the files uploads fine.  This is why I \nsuspect that the problem is with the warp connector.", "id": 10797, "time": "2002-02-16T06:39:37Z", "bug_id": 6499, "creation_time": "2002-02-16T06:39:37Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 4930 ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 15022, "creation_time": "2002-04-29T13:07:15Z", "time": "2002-04-29T13:07:15Z", "creator": "pier@betaversion.org", "bug_id": 6499, "is_private": false}]
