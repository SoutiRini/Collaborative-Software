I think that he had information in the file which should not be shared.\n\nRather than re-opening another issue, you really should submit a new bug. For instance you say your file was edited in Office 2007 and saved in compatibility mode. I wonder if you have applied every update to your copy of Office 2007? How did you edit the file?\n\nDo you get exactly the same error.\n\nRegards,\nDave"}, {"count": 6, "text": "(In reply to comment #5)\nOk.
