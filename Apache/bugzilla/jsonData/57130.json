Additionally, I made the password-file option ignore other password input, which can easily be reversed if that behavior was undesired. The documentation may need some touching up to incorporate the file option also (I added the option in the realm-howto explanation, but didn't amend the example use-case).\n\nLastly, I put in some comments to help understand my intention in case they were incorrect.
