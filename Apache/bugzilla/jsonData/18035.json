[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 18035, "text": "I am running Apache 2.0.44 with PHP 4.3 on a WIN32 Windows XP machine.  The \nproblem only occurs when POSTed variables are used within a PDFLIB function.  \nThe problem does not exist when I switch to Apache 1.3.27.  I have also tried \nwith and without the Zend Optimizer.  \n\nWhen I get input on script #1 and pass that information to script #2 via POST \nI can access the variable in everything but PDFLIB functions.  If I add die\n(\"$variable\") at any point prior to starting the PDFLIB PDF page, the variable \nis displayed fine.  Also, all IF loops work fine based on the POSTed \nvariables.  However, the variable itself and anything that was assigned a \nvalue based on the POSTed variable are not recognized within the newly created \nPDFLIB page.  \n\nFor instance, $variable is posted from script #1.  If $variable = condition \nthen $newvar = x.  The PDFLIB function not only doesn't recognize $variable \nbut it also doesn't recognize $newvar.  However, if I simply put $newvar = 12 \nthen it works fine.  \n\nWhen I switch the method to GET, everything works fine.\n\nI am not sure where the problem lies. . .Apache? PHP? PDFLIB?
