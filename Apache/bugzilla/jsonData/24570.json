[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24570, "text": "I am using jakarta-poi-1.10.0-dev version. I tried 2.0-pre3, it seems it has \nthe same problem. I have a file which properties are in Chinese characters. POI \ncan extract the properties (DocumentSummaryInformation and SummaryInformation), \nbut the characters are all messed up after extraction. I believe that it can \nnot handle the right encoding in TypeReader class. My OS is an English \noperating system, but it should not be a reason why POI is not working right. \nBecause I had a similar program to extract properties which is written in c++, \nit can do the right thing. BTW, I tried Japanse characters, it has the same \nproblem. I will attach this file, hopefully, this problem can be addressed \nsoon, because it is the critical path of my project now.
