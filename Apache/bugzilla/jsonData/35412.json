[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "creator": "solprovider@gmail.com", "text": "All Assets are required to have a Title.  The Title should be delivered whenever\nan Asset is used.  This is required for ADA section 508 compliance, which\nrequires websites to be accessible by people with handicaps.  The Act can be\nsummarized as requiring all content to be delivered in a format that can be\nspoken.  Lenya could be a great choice of software since the ability to deliver\ncontent through multiple stylesheets allows great control when creating\ntext-only versions of a website.\n\nA specific instance to gain ADA compliance is when IMG tags are generated, the\nTitle should be placed in the ALT parameter.  Other Assets should deliver the\nTitle as needed for their tags.\n\nThe easy answer is to fill the ALT tag with the Title when the page is edited.\n\nA better implementation would store the Image in the content by ID (filename?),\nthen generate the tag during processing.  Then the ALT would be updated if the\nAsset Title changes.  Nevermind, Lenya does not allow editing of Assets,\nprobably because the Title was useless-but-required data.  (This complements\nanother bugzilla I wrote about using Titles for choosing Images.  Users do not\ncare about filenames.)", "id": 76524, "time": "2005-06-19T02:19:16Z", "bug_id": 35412, "creation_time": "2005-06-19T02:19:16Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 35412, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 76710, "time": "2005-06-25T20:25:35Z", "creator": "gregor@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-06-25T20:25:35Z", "text": "this has been fixed"}]
