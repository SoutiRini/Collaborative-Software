Basically for the \"ServerTokens\" config directive, any random string will be regarded as the \"Full\" option. This bugged me when my input has typos, e.g., \n\nServerTokens Mionr\n\nWhat the patch does is to check whether the user input matches any option keyword, and prints out a log message to notify users if their input does not match any keyword. It still uses the \"Full\" option if none are matched so that it won't affect legacy systems, but only provide verbosity.\n\nThanks,\nJackie", "id": 163712, "attachment_id": 29650, "bug_id": 54222, "creation_time": "2012-11-28T23:39:02Z", "time": "2012-11-28T23:39:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "covener@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "text": "thanks for the report.

Afterall, it won't cause severe problems.  \n\nIf you need the fail startup patch, please let me know.", "id": 163715, "time": "2012-11-29T00:26:27Z", "creator": "jackie.qq.zhang@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2012-11-29T00:26:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
