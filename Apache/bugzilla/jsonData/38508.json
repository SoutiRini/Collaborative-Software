MessageFormat was\neating the single quote chars. Dialog now displays action and host name.\n\nMake the commands column no-wrap. If one host had a lot of aliases, then the\ncommand column cell would wrap, causing every row in the table to be double-height.\n\nLink in HostName field now goes to the host. Previously it would generate an\nunknown command.\n\nIf a host has no aliases, put a space in the cell so that the appearance is\nconsistent between all rows.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38508, "is_private": false, "id": 85414, "creation_time": "2006-02-04T16:49:45Z", "time": "2006-02-04T16:49:45Z", "creator": "gsexton@mhsoftware.com", "text": "Created attachment 17586\nPatch with modifications", "attachment_id": 17586}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Done.
