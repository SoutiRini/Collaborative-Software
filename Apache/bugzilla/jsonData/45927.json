I got everything running and most problems from our old 0.20.5 XSL are cleaned up. One of the remaining two problem is, that all text (in table cells) is now \"moved up\". By comparing the 0.20.5 PDF output with 0.95 PDF output, I've noticed, that FOP 0.20.5 centered text vertically by capital letters. FOP 0.95 is centering text by small letters:\n\nFOP 0.20.5 (capital letters are exactly centered):\n\n-------\n\nToDo\n\n-------\n\n\nFOP 0.95 (lower letters are exactly centered):\n\n-------\nToDo\n\n-------\n\nWhen I divide a table cell horizontally in 2 equal halfs, I see that the middle line is cutting the capital letters exactly in half with FOP 0.20.5. But with FOP 0.95 the middle line is cutting the lower letters exactly in half.\n\nI found a workaround for this: enclosing the text in fo:inline with alignment-adjust=\"central\" :\n\n                      <fo:inline alignment-adjust=\"central\">\n                          <xsl:value-of select=\".\"/>\n                      </fo:inline>\n\nAs I don't think that this is a clean solution for this problem, it's also a bad solution to change any (hundreds of hundreds ...) of occurence of text occurences in all the XSL files.\n\nIs there a better solution to \"fix\" this issue? Perhaps some global adjustments? I wonder why this happens in the first place?\n\n(I spend several days with compliance.html and the links to the w3c specifications and documentation trying unnumbered permutations of attribute combinations without being able to fix this without fo:inline.)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "See the following discussion on the fop-users mailing list:\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-fop-users/200810.mbox/<19779752.post@talk.nabble.com>\n\nThe new behaviour is correct and actually preferable to the old one.", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 45927, "id": 121234, "time": "2008-10-06T07:41:54Z", "creator": "vhennebert@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-10-06T07:41:54Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "mhilpert@gmx.de", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 121263, "time": "2008-10-07T02:08:26Z", "bug_id": 45927, "creation_time": "2008-10-07T02:08:26Z", "text": "Okay, but even if the new behaviour is correct: how to \"fix\" this to get the same behaviour of the old FOP?
