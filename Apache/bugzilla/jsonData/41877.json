It is actual when cgi-script reads data from standart input when \nmultipart/form-data enctype is used and file content is transferred. So, \nsymbols 0x0d simply disappears from the stream.\n\nConfiguration: Apache 2.2.3, Win XP SP2\n\nCan you say something about this trouble? May be some configuration options \nallow file content coding in %XX notation? Or maybe Apache supports wincgi?\n\nThank you!", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41877, "attachment_id": null, "id": 112069, "time": "2007-12-21T22:02:15Z", "creator": "wrowe@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-12-21T22:02:15Z", "is_private": false, "text": "its a user question - whatever is written to apache will be sent to the client.\n\nyou probably open the stream in 'unix text mode' so your \\r\\n's become \\n\n"}]
