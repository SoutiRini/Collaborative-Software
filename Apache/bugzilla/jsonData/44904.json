[{"text": "Hi,\n\nWhile I was trying to set up a Tomcat 5.5.26, using an old configuration from a Tomcat 5.5.9, I did copy & paste of a datasource with the following form:\n\n    <Resource\n      name=\"jdbc/MySQLDS\"\n      type=\"javax.sql.DataSource\"\n      password=\"password\"\n      driverClassName=\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\"\n      maxIdle=\"8\"\n      maxWait=\"5000\"\n      validationQuery=\"\"\n      username=\"username\"\n      url=\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull\"\n      maxActive=\"0\" />\n\nThis works under 5.5.9, but it doesn't work on 5.5.26. Both databases are the same (MySQL 5.0.x) and equal JDBC driver (MySQL 5.0.3)\n\nChanging the maxActive attribute to some positive or negative value it will start working.\n\nThe maxActive=\"0\" will refuse to get a connection from the database and will throw an exception because of the exhausted timeout period. \n\nThis is clear to me now after being researching the issue, but it would be nice to add at least a WARNING in a log file when detected that maxActive=\"0\".\n\n(Don't know if this enhacement belongs to Tomcat or DBCP, though.)\n\nRegards,\nGabriel", "tags": [], "bug_id": 44904, "is_private": false, "count": 0, "id": 116033, "time": "2008-04-29T12:01:26Z", "creator": "belingueres@yahoo.com.ar", "creation_time": "2008-04-29T12:01:26Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44904, "is_private": false, "text": "This Tomcat 5 enhancement request has been moved to Tomcat 7 (the latest version) since Tomcat 5 development is limited and focussed on bugs and security issues whereas Tomcat 7 is still seeing new feature development.", "id": 152340, "time": "2011-12-20T20:36:48Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2011-12-20T20:36:48Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "There are far too many configuration settings that can me set in ways likely to break things to add warnings for every one.
