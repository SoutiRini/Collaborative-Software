It then fails with the regular bind() syscall.\n\nWith     setsockopt(..., SO_BINDTODEVICE, \"ethX\", ...); on could simply bind to the device, and any floating IP subsequently attached to it (with VRRP or manual \"ip addr add\" commands) could receive requests.\n\nOf course, people usually don't care because INADDR_ANY satisfies most simple uses. However, there are real life setups where one wants to restrict to one interface for security reasons, or for modularity (because another service or Apache instance runs on the same port on another interface).\n\nThe SO_BINDTODEVICE method could easily be triggered by a syntax extension to Listen, as has also been proposed by those who do it by hand.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 52978, "id": 155262, "time": "2012-03-23T13:28:16Z", "creator": "alexandre.ferrieux@orange-ftgroup.com", "creation_time": "2012-03-23T13:28:16Z", "is_private": false}]
