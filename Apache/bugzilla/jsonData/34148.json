If you declare\na Virtualhost bound to IP address X but X is not bound to any interface of\nyour machine, this is *not* an error. \n\nWhy would anyone need this?\n\nI have a range of machines and websites. Each website has its own IP\naddress, separate from the machine's IP address. \n\nWhat I want to do is be able to move a website from machine to machine without\n*any* editing of httpd.conf.\n\nIn the ideal case, I would say in httpd.conf:\n\nListen <IP-website1>:80\nListen <IP-website2>:80\nListen <IP-website3>:80\n\nThen, on machine 1, I assign <IP-website1> and <IP-website3> to the NIC,\nrestart Apache, and we are rolling.\n\nOn machine 2, I assign <IP-website2> to the NIC, restart Apache, and all\nthe websites are up.\n\nGood idea or what?"}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "jorton@redhat.com", "text": "Well, you could achieve that using IfDefine, preprocessing the config file, etc;\ncertainly the default behaviour shouldn't change here and I can't see a strong\nmotivation to make a new directive or option etc to allow this behaviour.", "id": 73005, "time": "2005-03-29T18:02:47Z", "bug_id": 34148, "creation_time": "2005-03-29T18:02:47Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
