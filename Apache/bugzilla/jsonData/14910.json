So for a sheet with 10 rows and 12 columns, \nthe values returned should be 9 (rows) and 11 (columns) as numbering is 0-based.\n\nHowever getLastCellNum() returns the count (ie. 12) instead of the actual \nlocation. I had sent out email to the mailing list with a simple program to \ntest this functionality along with a test excel file. Please use those (since \nit doesnt seem like I can attach files to this bug report). Also note that I \ntried this only on WinNT but it might be a problem on other platforms as well ??"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "knrao@hotmail.com", "attachment_id": 3971, "id": 27085, "time": "2002-11-27T19:53:27Z", "bug_id": 14910, "creation_time": "2002-11-27T19:53:27Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 3971\nsimple java file to reproduce problem"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 3972\ntest excel file", "attachment_id": 3972, "bug_id": 14910, "id": 27086, "time": "2002-11-27T19:53:58Z", "creator": "knrao@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2002-11-27T19:53:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "knrao@hotmail.com", "text": "managed to attach the files here. check them out !", "id": 27087, "time": "2002-11-27T19:54:29Z", "bug_id": 14910, "creation_time": "2002-11-27T19:54:29Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "avik@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 27726, "time": "2002-12-12T12:58:13Z", "bug_id": 14910, "creation_time": "2002-12-12T12:58:13Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 15184 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "bug_id": 14910, "attachment_id": null, "text": "This should NOT be changed in a hurry without understanding the implications,\nsince the method is called internally many times.
