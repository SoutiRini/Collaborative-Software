Also, a relative path does not work either.  For example, if you have a file named 'test.txt' next to your project.jmx file, neither of these File paths will reach it:\n~/test.txt\ntext.txt\n~text.txt\n\nAn absolute path works, but that is just about useless in most environments.\n\n2) The file will not be sent if the UI is on the 'Body Data' tab, even if this tab has no content.  Simply switching to the Parameters tab causes the file to be included.\n\n3) If the file is included in the body of the POST, user parameters, eg ${myVarName}, are not replaced before the content is sent in the body.  This is unexpected b/c these variables are replaced if you put them in the Body Data tab.\n\nAs a final note, the handling of '~' as being relative to the .jmx file is inconsistent across components.  The docs say this should work, but it doesn't work for this component or for the CSV Data Set Config component (I know, its another bug...)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "hppyhjh@163.com", "attachment_id": 32142, "text": "Created attachment 32142\nfile will not be sent if the UI is on the 'Body Data' tab. fix it.\n\npatch for:\n2) The file will not be sent if the UI is on the 'Body Data' tab, even if this tab has no content.
