Ran Apache and it executed fine, though \nwhenever i tried accessing it as localhost or 127.0.0.1 (after following \ninstall instructions on multiple sites specifying it should work) nothing would \nappear, it would load for several minutes and never complete or actually load \nanything or it might report a dsn error every so often under certain \ncircumstances. Installed it many times alternating between console and service, \nand changing the port from 80 to 8080 and vice versa. I saw you had an article \nabout XP not working without SP1, and I have SP1 and SP2 installed. Checked the \nonline forums and the web and found no solutions but other users with the same \nproblem. I installed it on my old 166MHz comp running win 98 and it worked \nfine. Installed it exactly the same on the XP comp again and still didn't work. \nDownloaded the old version 28 or 29 I believe, and it worked fine. I believe \nthere must be some incompatibility between this newest version and win XP. You \nmay want to make a mention of it on your site since I've seen numerous posts on \nthe forums and the web about this problem and no solutions.\n\nsorry for writing so much, just wanna be thorough"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 26474, "attachment_id": null, "id": 60498, "time": "2004-07-12T18:02:32Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2004-07-12T18:02:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please see\nhttp://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/README.html"}]
