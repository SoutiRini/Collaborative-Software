FOP \ndoesn't report an error and compiles correctly, but the PDF-file has following \nerror: The fo:external-graphic attributes 'height' and 'width' reserve the \nstated lengths and let the text begin after the height-value, but the image is \nas big as before, it's not scaled and overlaps the text. When using content-\nheight and content-width the same error happens. \nHave a look at the PDF-file at http://www.sknetworks.de/dknapp/wca_esf1.pdf and \nthe FO-file at http://www.sknetworks.de/dknapp/wca_esf1.fo.\n\nWhen using <fo:instream-foreign-object> there's the same error.\n\nIf you need more information feel free to contact me at sk188@informatik.uni-\nrostock.de or dknapp@gmx.net", "id": 4899, "time": "2001-08-27T05:29:22Z", "bug_id": 3279, "creation_time": "2001-08-27T05:29:22Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jamie.lokier@degree2.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Bug 5001 is nearly a duplicate of this one.\nI've attached a patch to 5001 which goes some way to making\ncontent-width work.
