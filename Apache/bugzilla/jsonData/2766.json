My problem is that I have to put information about the \nversion number of the source into the manifest-file.

Is the \nspelling there correct? I would expect an exception, though, if the property \nwas not valid. When you say you get a blank manifest file, what exactly do you \nmean by blank. Does it not have Created-By: Ant 1.3 and the Manifest-Version \nheader. If it doesn't have these then perhaps ${mmanifest} is pointing to a \nblank file.\n\nFinally, I have just committed new Manifest handling code. Could you try a \nnightly build in the next few days and see what results that gives.\n", "id": 4092, "time": "2001-07-28T07:21:49Z", "bug_id": 2766, "creation_time": "2001-07-28T07:21:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
