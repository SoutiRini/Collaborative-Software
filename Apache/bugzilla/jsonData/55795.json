In tomcat http connector docs, there are so many attributes named *timeout, like connectionTimeout,\nconnectionUploadTimeout, keepAliveTimeout, selectorTimeout, sessionTimeout and so on. But their description are not same or in a same way.\n \nLike \"sessionTimeout \", it's description:\nthe time, in seconds, after the creation of an SSL session that it will timeout. Use 0 to specify an unlimited timeout. If not specified, a default of 86400 (24 hours) is used.\n \nBut \"keepAliveTimeout\", it;s description:\nhe number of milliseconds this Connector will wait for another HTTP request before closing the connection. The default value is to use the value that has been set for the connectionTimeout attribute. Use a value of -1 to indicate no (i.e. infinite) timeout.\n \nSo, I want to know, is -1 and 0 both means unlimited timeout? Or what's  difference between -1 and 0 ?\n \n \n \nThanks advance."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55795, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 171306, "time": "2013-11-19T07:27:47Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-11-19T07:27:47Z", "text": "Bugzilla is  not a support forum.
