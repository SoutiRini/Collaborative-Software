The zip contains the appender src, some testcases and\nrequired libs (JDOM,log4j 1.3 alpha7 and ROME).   \n  The appender outputs log events to an RSS or ATOM feed. It can deal with the\nenclosing XML tags and recreate a feed from scratch or append to an existing\nfile. It supports rudimentary event buffering and configurable event/entry\nmapping. The Appender works with Java 1.3/1.4. The details of the underlying\nfeed formats are delegated down to ROME - https://rome.dev.java.net. (Apache\nV2), which is turn uses JDOM - http://www.jdom.org/. (An apache V2 like license)  \n  regards,\n  Lara\n  ldabreotech@yahoo.com \n\n------\n\nContribution will be initially added to\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/sandbox/log4j/contribs/LaraDAbreo."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37762, "attachment_id": 17124, "is_private": false, "id": 83156, "time": "2005-12-02T21:41:02Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-12-02T21:41:02Z", "text": "Created attachment 17124\nSubmission from Lara DAbreo"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37762, "attachment_id": null, "id": 83271, "time": "2005-12-06T01:19:19Z", "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-12-06T01:19:19Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Submission committed in r 354238.\n\nSee http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=113339001100004&r=1&w=2 and http://\nmarc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=log4j-dev&m=113319464331893&w=2 for discussion of this contribution, \nconcerns and alternative approaches.\n\n"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 37762, "attachment_id": null, "id": 127818, "time": "2009-06-10T13:20:14Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-06-10T13:20:14Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Reset assignee so mails go to list."}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Contribution is in SVN at sandbox/log4j/contribs/trunk/LaraDAbreo/RSSAppender/.
