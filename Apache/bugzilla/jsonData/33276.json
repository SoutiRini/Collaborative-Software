In the user defined\nvariable I have a variable named test which is set to be a random number 1 or 0.\nThe first controller tests to see if the variable is 1 and the second tests for 0.\n\nActual Results:\nWhen I run this test, the if controllers are either evaluated as false or they\nare skipped all together. I am not sure which. \n\nExpected:\nI should be able to define a variable and immeditly use it in an if controller.\n\nWorkaround: If I I have a http call before the if controllers the problem does\nnot appear."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "is_private": false, "text": "A work-round is to define the variable on the Test Plan element.", "id": 72165, "time": "2005-03-11T03:01:09Z", "bug_id": 33276, "creation_time": "2005-03-11T03:01:09Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Seems to have been fixed by fixing 32790\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 32790 ***", "attachment_id": null, "id": 72274, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "time": "2005-03-12T03:42:22Z", "bug_id": 33276, "creation_time": "2005-03-12T03:42:22Z", "is_private": false}]
