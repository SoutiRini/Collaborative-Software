As the build script does not fail on javadoc errors, an automated build process is likely to deliver an incomplete API reference. This is especially annoying as there is no API on the official Ant home page.\n\nThe cause seems to be that src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/MagicNames.java contains a few doc comments which have @since before @value. Switching those lines solves the problem. The offending lines were introduced by r393282 and r405523.\n\nThe attached patch solves the issue.
