[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "The Translate task currently does the following when a key can't be found in \nany of the property files:\n\n1. It replaces the delimiter tokens + key with just the key. In other \nwords, \"#mykey#\" becomes \"mykey\".\n2. It logs a debug-level message indicating that the key couldn't be found.\n\nI would prefer that:\n\n1. It leaves the matched string untouched. That is \"#mykey#\" \nremains \"#mykey#\". This will make it easier to locate the problematic key in \nthe source file.\n2. It logs a more visible warning or error. Chances are I forgot to add a key \nto the properties file, had a typo, or matched something was wasn't supposed \nto be matched. The first cases are errors that I would like the task to help \nme catch. The latter is something you hope doesn't happen (I'll log an \nenhancement on that subject later).", "is_private": false, "id": 25139, "creator": "Eric.Smith@NextPage.com", "time": "2002-10-24T15:53:48Z", "bug_id": 13936, "creation_time": "2002-10-24T15:53:48Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in the nightly cvs version on Oct 03, 03.", "is_private": false, "id": 45068, "creator": "umagesh@apache.org", "time": "2003-10-03T22:24:51Z", "bug_id": 13936, "creation_time": "2003-10-03T22:24:51Z", "attachment_id": null}]
