I hope I can get a hint from the\ndevelopers, since forum and mailing lists did not had any clue.\n\nThe system:\nPC with SuSE Linux 8.0 and kernel 2.4.20\nApache 2.0.45\nPHP-3.2RC1\nMySQL 4.0.12\n\nThe software: PHPnuke 6.5\nThe server works correct, when data are updated on the same LAN.\nAfter testing we moved the server to the server co-location place and now we\ncannot add LONG stories, cannot change preferences (of PHPnuke).\nSince nothing has been changed - except the IP address it is very hard to narrow\ndown. I believe that we get a timeout when we try to change / add data, but I\ncannot find any variable what I could set to overcome this.\nAs shorter the new article as more sure it will be taken, if the article gets\nlonger, it might be that we need just to submit the article several times, and\nit will be taken.\n\nI think the flow of the data is: editor site --> apache 2.0 --> php --> mysql \nIf the data are not taken, than the next home page will be displayed without any\ndelay, which makes me think that the (possible) timeout is in apache.\n\nTill last week I was the only one with that problem, but today I found in\nnuke4newbie, nukeforum also other people experiencing the same problem.\n\nAny hints are highly appreciated!", "id": 36267, "time": "2003-04-29T07:19:27Z", "bug_id": 19416, "creation_time": "2003-04-29T07:19:27Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "slive@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 55101, "time": "2004-04-01T20:09:03Z", "bug_id": 19416, "creation_time": "2004-04-01T20:09:03Z", "text": "Sorry, but there isn't much we can do without details on exactly what is\nfailing.
