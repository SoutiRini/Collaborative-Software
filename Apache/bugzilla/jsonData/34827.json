These tests should detect changes in the serialized form resulting from changes in \nLoggingEvent and other classes.\n\nIn addition, the bug adds a CoreTestSuite to tests/build.xml which can serve as a home for class-level \ntests without requiring each test to have a corresponding entry in tests/build.xml.\n\nSee http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=111359016700002&r=1&w=2 (topic \"to-do \nlist\", initial posting 15 April 2005) for discussion on the motivation for writing these tests."}]
