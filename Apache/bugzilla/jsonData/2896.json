[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 2896, "text": "I found out that the behavior for File - exit, and the behavior of the right\nupper \"x\" doesn\u00b4t exit in same way.\nI think you should use the same method when closing even if you still not\nare finnished with it yet as I can see in outprint when closing.\nI have included the change I did so it used the same Command \"ExitCommand.java\".\nI allso suggest that you declare the command strings in your class as \npublic final static String EXIT = \"exit\"; instead of hardcode them in different\nplaces in the code. That way one could use them and get a compilationcheck\nfor them instead. That aplies for all Commands.\nChanges made with comment <new code>\nin file:\norg.apache.jmeter.gui.MainFrame.java\n\nprivate void init()\n\t{\n\t\tmenuBar = new JMeterMenuBar();\n\t\tcreateToolBar();\n\t\tcreateTreePanel();\n\t\tcreateMainPanel();\n\t\taddThemAll();\n\t\t\t\t\t addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  public void windowClosing\n(WindowEvent evt) {\n   //<new code>\n   //System.exit(0);\n   actionHandler.actionPerformed(new ActionEvent(this,evt.getID(),\"exit\"));\n   //</new code>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t });\n\t}", "id": 4139, "time": "2001-07-30T08:36:40Z", "creator": "bo.regnlin@pc.nu", "creation_time": "2001-07-30T08:36:40Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
