I'll give a brief summary here again:\n\n* Subversion uses DAV to implement its functionality in Apache.\n* When using the svn merge command on a directory, subversion removes any trailing slash (if present)\n* Apache replies with a 302 redirect to the same URL with a trailing slash\n* Subversion treats the redirect answer as error\n\nI asked subversion to include the trailing slash, however they answered mod_dav does not like trailing slashes. So it seems that mod_dav and some other part in apache don't agree on whether they want the URL with or without trailing slash.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n* install recent versions of apache and subversion\n* create a repository and a branch\n* do an svn merge of a whole subtree (i.e. svn merge -rx:y http://localhost/svn/my_repository/some_directory my_working_copy_directory)"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "rpluem@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 118584, "time": "2008-07-11T14:49:09Z", "bug_id": 45379, "creation_time": "2008-07-11T14:49:09Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Please try if setting redirect-carefully fixes your problem (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/env.html#special).\n\nBrowserMatch \"SVN/1\\.\" redirect-carefully\n\nshould do the trick."}]
