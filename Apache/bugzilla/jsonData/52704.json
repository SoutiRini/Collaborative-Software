Apache PDFBox had to do similar things:\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#no-modification\n\nI had added the profile back in 2006 in good faith that putting the license text right next to the file is sufficient. Apparently, it isn't.\n\nWhile this fixes the problem for the ASF, the binary JAR will still contain the color profile which the Linuxers will still leave unhappy. However, I wonder how other open source projects packaged as Unix packages avoid the problem of using things like Adobe's CMaps and Base14 AFM font metrics files.\n\nTo fix the Linuxers' problem we'd need an open source implementation of the sRGB spec as an ICC color profile. I haven't found one on the net. Practically all color profiles I can find have similar license terms as the HP color profile. Also note that Oracle Java 6.0_29, for example, also bundles the exact same HP sRGB profile as Apache FOP. OpenJDK, OTOH, seems to be having a different sRGB profile which contains the string \"lcms\" and that points to LittleCMS, but I haven't found the original file in its source code. I also had problems finding the source code repository of OpenJDK to get an idea where that file came from and what its license is. Maybe the Linuxers can help here.\n\nNote that the sRGB color profile was added so the colors coming from XSL-FO and SVG can remain untouched for the output formats that support ICC color management (ex. PDF). FOP could theoretically live without the profile but at the loss of calibrated RGB colors and PDF/A and PDF/X functionality.
