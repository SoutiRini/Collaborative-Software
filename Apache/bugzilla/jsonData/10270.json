A\nshorter form of the above JSP is:\n\n<jsp:include page=\"<%= (Object)\\\"logo.jsp\\\"%>\" flush=\"true\"/>\n\n\nSeems that calling toString() would be the easiest fix.\n\n\nthanks,\n\n--Jeff", "id": 18631, "time": "2002-06-27T03:54:29Z", "bug_id": 10270, "creation_time": "2002-06-27T03:54:29Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "The string inside <%= ... %> is not evaluated by jasper, and it may not even\nrepresent an object (it can be any expression), to which toString() can be\napplied.
