(Also, a few duplicative methods were removed from \napps.Document, where they can be otherwise obtained by Document.getDriver()--\ni.e., getUserAgent(), getLogger().)  apps.Document, in turn, includes this \nobject as a member variable.  Other packages and classes that were getting a \napps.Document in the past will go back* to just getting a FontInfo object, \nwhere appropriate.\n\nI'll apply in a couple of days if no issues from anyone.  (Please hold off on \nany file changes in the interim affecting these files, if possible.)\n\nThanks,\nGlen\n\n* apps.Document was created by Victor several months back, when he took \nLayout.FontInfo, and incorporated it into this new class (with several new \nmethods as well).  Many other classes (e.g., transcoder-related) that just \nneeded a FontInfo object started being fed the whole apps.Document object as a \nconsequence.  This returns FontInfo as a parameter to these classes, albeit \nfrom the Fonts package this time around.", "id": 56217, "time": "2004-04-21T23:23:31Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-04-21T23:23:31Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 11305\nFontInfo patch file (note: fonts.FontInfo itself is already in CVS)", "is_private": false, "id": 56218, "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "time": "2004-04-21T23:24:58Z", "bug_id": 28525, "creation_time": "2004-04-21T23:24:58Z", "attachment_id": 11305}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28525, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Applied.", "id": 56282, "time": "2004-04-22T21:42:29Z", "creator": "glenmazza@yahoo.com", "creation_time": "2004-04-22T21:42:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 28525, "text": "batch transition pre-FOP1.0 resolved+fixed bugs to closed+fixed", "id": 156176, "time": "2012-04-01T07:02:50Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-04-01T07:02:50Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
