Missing openssl.exe\n\nThis binary is needed to generate server certificates and for other server maintenance.\n\nAs Native 1.2.4 and 1.2.3 are built with the same version of OpenSSL, the binary from released native 1.2.3 can be used instead.\n\n2. Missing PDB files for 64-bit binaries\n\nAccording to [4][5] the pdb files are specific for each produced binary. Apparently the script does not copy the pdb file for 64-bit binary.\n\n\n[1] http://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/mocepn7uswddyfna\n\n[2] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TOMCAT/Building+the+Tomcat+Native+Connector+binaries+for+Windows\n\n[3] https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/BuildTcNativeWin\n\n[4] https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yd4f8bd1%28v=vs.100%29.aspx\n\n[5] http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jimgries/archive/2007/07/06/why-does-visual-studio-require-debugger-symbol-files-to-exactly-match-the-binary-files-that-they-were-built-with.aspx", "id": 187524, "time": "2016-01-09T22:16:41Z", "creator": "knst.kolinko@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-01-09T22:16:41Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "markt@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 187533, "time": "2016-01-11T10:36:55Z", "bug_id": 58831, "creation_time": "2016-01-11T10:36:55Z", "tags": [], "text": "Script updated.
