From what\nit goes from our research is; the directory shows a forbidden flag when apache\ntries to Index it. Please can you have this checked. \n\nFor the current error we have used Options +ShowForbidden to have this\ndisplayed, but please do check on why it doesn't get displayed during normal\noperation of .htaccess. \n\nThank you.\n\nWith Best Regards,\n\nPrasul Surendran", "id": 112845, "time": "2008-01-14T17:56:27Z", "creator": "prasul@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-01-14T17:56:27Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "slive@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 113117, "time": "2008-01-24T12:38:24Z", "bug_id": 44234, "creation_time": "2008-01-24T12:38:24Z", "tags": [], "text": "This is exactly as designed.
