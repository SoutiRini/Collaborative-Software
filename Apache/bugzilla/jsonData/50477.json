(And, there is no way to insert PooledConnection to the idle queue except to use the getConnection method.)\nTherefore, the ItemFuture.get method doesn't return Connection.\n\nI made the patch. It is the following. \nIf the pool size is empty then create a PooledConnection and insert it to the idle queue.\n\nregards.", "id": 142730, "time": "2010-12-15T04:40:32Z", "bug_id": 50477, "creation_time": "2010-12-15T04:40:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 26408}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "fhanik@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 143152, "time": "2011-01-06T18:54:09Z", "bug_id": 50477, "creation_time": "2011-01-06T18:54:09Z", "tags": [], "text": "Thank you for the report.
