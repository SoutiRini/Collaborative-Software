I've got confirmation from others\nthat this problem is not only mine, so please take the time to read this.\n\nI've tried Apache 1.3 and 2.0, both on Linux 2.4. I've tried using suEXEC and\nnot using suEXEC, and I even tried modules that stop script execution at a\nspecific load average (tested with 1.00!) or number of processes (tested with\n10!). But nothing seems to help in the following case:\n\nI run PHP as CGI because I don't want to have world-readable scripts and\nmod_perchild is not ready yet. When I do a hard reload - i.e. reloading the same\nscript for about 10 seconds continously which should open quite a lot of scripts\n- I can crash the server. PHP-CGI-processes become zombies, I get a load average\nof about 90 (!) and it can take up to 30 minutes until the system responds\nagain. This happens even with the simplest PHP scripts like a phpinfo call, but\nPerl scripts make absolutely no problem.\n\nThe PHP developers say it's an Apache problem, the Apache developers say it's a\nPHP problem. So *PLEASE* take the time to review this one again - I'm helpless\nright now! :-( I know there must be a solution, because some providers run PHP\nas CGI without problems, but I don't know what it could be. :-(", "id": 58311, "time": "2004-05-28T12:38:58Z", "creator": "floeff@arcor.de", "creation_time": "2004-05-28T12:38:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 29276, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Ok, as found out on users@, this is actually not a httpd problem.", "id": 58352, "time": "2004-05-28T20:19:32Z", "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "creation_time": "2004-05-28T20:19:32Z", "is_private": false}]
