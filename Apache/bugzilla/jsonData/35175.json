Add current Authoring \"Display\" and \"Edit Content\" as tabs on\nSite.  Combine most tabs for vertical Form rather than many tabs.  Move \"Change\nNode Visibility\" to Field on page.\n\nThe basic concept is to show as much as possible on one screen.  Vertical\nscrolling is fine.  One Save button takes care of everything.  Reduce menus as\nmuch as possible.  Use \"tabs\" to switch between \"Info\" (everything on META\nWorkflow, Security, and Schedule tabs), \"Edit (Kupu)\", \"Edit (BXE)\", \"Display\".  \n\nI mentioned in another report that Assets should be controlled by publication,\nnot pages.
