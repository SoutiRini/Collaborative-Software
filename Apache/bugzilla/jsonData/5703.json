I was trying to do a <java fork=\"yes\" ... task, and it\nwas unable to do it.\n\nThe problem was that I had /usr/local/netscape479 in the front of my\nPATH.  Under there is a \"java\" directory.  Apparently the\njava.lang.UNIXProcess.forkAndExec(Native Method) method steps\nthrough the path and if it finds a file (or dir!), it tries to run\nit.  As soon as I moved /usr/local/netscape479 to the end of my path,\nit works.  Call it operator error, but the error message that came\nfrom Ant (or forkAndExec method) was kind of tough to resolve.\n\nThx- close this any time you feel.  PS - I saw other bugs like this\nclosed as \"works for me\", because it was an environment problem,\nI think it really just needs to be noted in a faq somewhere.", "id": 9376, "time": "2002-01-05T10:43:28Z", "bug_id": 5703, "creation_time": "2002-01-05T10:43:28Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "conor@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "This sounds like a JDK bug.
