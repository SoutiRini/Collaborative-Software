I've done a short profiling session which immediately highlighted Java2DFontMetrics as hot spot. Both PCL and Java2D use that. Without investigating more closely, I believe that performance could be improved a lot by implementing a better cache mechanism for Java2D-based font metrics. This is not a high priority for me at the moment which is why I'm just making this note in Bugzilla."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 157464, "time": "2012-04-07T01:43:14Z", "bug_id": 46702, "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:43:14Z", "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review"}]
