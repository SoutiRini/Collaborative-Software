Potentially the attacker can also write \nto every file that Apache has access to. This bug involves CGI changing \ndirectories and then listing directory contents or file contents.\nSince CGI is executed either as the HTTPd user itself, or another global user, \nfile system permissions can stop that user writing to disk. However, this \ndoesn't help most win32 Operating Systems.\nAs an effort to aid a possible solution, the only way I can see is to execute \nCGI as each specific user. For example, if the HTTP_USER is blank, then CGI \nshould only be allowed \"anonymous\" access rights, and therefore access rights \ncan be setup on a per-user basis."}, {"text": "That's not a bug.
