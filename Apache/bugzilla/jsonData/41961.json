Java is of course also\nsensitive.  When a java class name changes case and is checked into StarTeam,\nmachines that still have a local copy of the file with the old cased name do not\nget updated when the StarTeam checkout task runs.  The file contents are\nupdated, but the case of the name is left as it was before.  One workaround is\nto first delete the file, then call checkout.  This is impractical as it forces\nyou to do a clean checkout every time which is far more time consuming than an\nupdate would be.\n\nI am attaching a patch that fixes the problem and allows changes to the case of\na filename in StarTeam to be checked out locally as well."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41961, "text": "Created attachment 19818\nif file should be checked out, then also forces case of name to match server", "id": 101057, "time": "2007-03-27T10:58:04Z", "creator": "BBurgess@tiaa-cref.org", "creation_time": "2007-03-27T10:58:04Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": 19818}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41961, "attachment_id": null, "id": 165938, "time": "2013-03-18T02:25:43Z", "creator": "antoine@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-03-18T02:25:43Z", "is_private": false, "text": "starteam ant tasks have been removed starting with Ant 1.8.0"}]
