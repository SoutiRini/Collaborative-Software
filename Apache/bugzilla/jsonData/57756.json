[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57756, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Can a server config option be added to control MAX_REQUESTS_IN_PIPELINE in Apache 2.4+?\n\nThe handling of Pipelined request where a client request may live on for MAX_REQUESTS_IN_PIPELINE requests causes problems with modules that have not been sufficiently updated for Apache 2.4 even if they are in Linux distributions considered stable that also offer Apache 2.4 per default. See https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68486 for example.\n\nFor server administrators this puts them between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand they have a developer audience demanding newer module versions, and on the other hand they don't have the resources to build stable distributions themselves, and they have a very limited option available in the Apache configuration to fallback to reliable behaviour. The aforementioned bug has been observed to completely lockup a webserver for module requests without anyone even maliciously trying to crash it.\n\nThe only option now would be to completely turn off keep-alive. If there is a option to set MAX_REQUESTS_IN_PIPELINE on/off or to a certain integer, this would be much preferable.", "id": 182091, "time": "2015-03-25T12:13:12Z", "creator": "gmoniker@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2015-03-25T12:13:12Z", "is_private": false}]
