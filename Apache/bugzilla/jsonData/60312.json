[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60312, "is_private": false, "text": "It is no unusual requirement, to invoke an Ant script from within a Java class. This procedure is, what I would describe as (\"Embed Ant in Java\").\n\nTo support such a use case, there shuld be an EmbeddedAnt bean, or something similar, with methods like getBuildFile(), setBuildFile(File pFile), and the like, which does just that. However, AFAIK, there is no such thing.\n\nIn the \"Running Apache Ant\" document (https://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html), there's a section \"Running Ant via Java\". However, that advice is close to unusable. It suggests either of the classes Main, or Launcher. Neither of these is suited for embedding, because they both invoke System.exit(), which is clearly not allowed in an embedded solution.\n\nThis request is to create a solution for embedding Ant. Or, if such a solution exists, have it documented.\n\nThanks,\n\nJochen", "id": 194687, "time": "2016-10-27T10:21:41Z", "creator": "jochen.wiedmann@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-10-27T10:21:41Z", "attachment_id": null}]
