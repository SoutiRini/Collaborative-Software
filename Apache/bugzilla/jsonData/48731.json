I have plenty of RAM for it to do so.\n\nI've even set StartServers/MinSpareServers to 50 and MaxSpareServers to 80. Only 10 were created after restarting to apply the changes.\n\nI have restarted Apache several times and it didn't fix my issue. I've even reinstalled it and my whole machine and setup the configuration manually again."}]
