Let me explain (all line #'s listed below are inside \nsendFile method).\n\nLine #1678 creates a file to transfer and then calls resolveFile(filename) to \nfix the separator for the target platform. This is good. What is bad is the \ncode on line #1709 to issue a chmod Site Command. The chmod Site Command is \nissued with the the old \"filename\" variable, which contains the Windows \nseparators. Because of this, the chmod is not successful when the source \nplatform is Windows and the target platform is UNIX. To fix this, line 1709 \nshould have been something like:\n\n  doSiteCommand(ftp, \"chmod \" + chmod + \" \" + file.getPath());\n\nThe file.getPath() will designate the correct separator and the chmod should \nexecute successfully.", "id": 44117, "time": "2003-09-12T17:34:48Z", "creator": "cmcfarland@onebox.com", "creation_time": "2003-09-12T17:34:48Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 23143, "attachment_id": null, "id": 44132, "time": "2003-09-12T20:34:15Z", "creator": "antoine@apache.org", "creation_time": "2003-09-12T20:34:15Z", "is_private": false, "text": "problem fixed in CVS, will be available in the next nightly."}]
