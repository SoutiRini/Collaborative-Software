[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "I think, that this is a wrong idea to explicitly define a parameter \"charset\" \nfor any contentType of Response.\nFor examples:\n1. I render a PDF document as a response of my servlet with \ncontentType=\"application/pdf\". Then the \"IE\" receives a \nheader \"application/pdf;charset=ISO-8859-1\" and it can't understand this \ncontent type. Even more, do you see, that this charset parameter is useless \nhere?\n2. I put into my JSP page a line like this: <%@ page \ncontentType=\"text/html;CHARSET=windows-1251\" %>. I use here an uppercase for \nCHARSET to avoid character encoding (transforming) of my JSP page by the \nengine, so it must use a system default encoding (I use this for multilanguage \nsupport in my application, that works with a database without unicode, and I \ndidn't thinking about encoding, just gives this part for browser). The browser \nreceives a header: \"text/html;CHARSET=windows-1251;charset=ISO-8859-1\"! Great!\n\nConclusion: take back a control on the content type to the user, please!", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 25162, "id": 48415, "time": "2003-12-03T13:03:26Z", "creator": "maxoid@mail.ru", "creation_time": "2003-12-03T13:03:26Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "is_private": false, "id": 48416, "time": "2003-12-03T13:27:15Z", "bug_id": 25162, "creation_time": "2003-12-03T13:27:15Z", "tags": [], "text": "This is fixed in 5.0.16 which should be out any moment.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 24970 ***"}]
