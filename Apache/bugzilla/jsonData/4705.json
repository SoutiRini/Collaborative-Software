[{"count": 0, "text": "I was attempting to make use of JSPC to pre-compile JSP files for the build \nprocess, not so much to make use of those pre-compiled JSPs as it was to catch \nJSP compilation errors before deploying the application and running the \nHttpUnit tests.  I ran into problems.  Tomcat reported that it couldn't load \nsome of my beans used in the JSPs, but only a few specific beans in a few \nspecific files.\n\nAfter a long run of trying to figure out what was wrong, I managed to discover \nthat the problem only occurred using <jsp:getProperty>.  With further analysis, \nit became clear that if I did <jsp:useBean> on a bean that was in the WEB-\nINF/classes, and then <jsp:getProperty>, it would work fine.  If I used \n<jsp:useBean on a bean that was in a jar in WEB-INF/lib, then tried \n<jsp:getProperties>, the JSPC process wouldn't be able to find the bean.  \nWithout the jsp:getProperties tag, though, it would work just fine.\n\nStrangely, it also works just fine within Tomcat when tomcat is running.  The \napplication has no troubles with those pages, even though I can't pre-compile \nthem.\n\nThe failure only occurs when using jsp:getProperty after jsp:useBean on a bean \nthat can be found in a jar in WEB-INF/lib, when using JSPC rather than tomcat.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you have any troubles duplicating this.  \n\nI'm using JBoss-2.4.1 with Embedded CatalinaSX, although I tried using my \npreviously-installed Tomcat standalone, and had the same problem.", "bug_id": 4705, "is_private": false, "id": 7649, "time": "2001-11-07T08:44:46Z", "creator": "geoff@mediumone.com", "creation_time": "2001-11-07T08:44:46Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "kin-man.chung@sun.com", "is_private": false, "id": 8752, "time": "2001-12-10T10:11:39Z", "bug_id": 4705, "creation_time": "2001-12-10T10:11:39Z", "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in nightly build 20011210"}]
