I spotted it with #56737\n\nIn excel, if you create a formula which references a named range in another file, eg \"TestFile.xls!NR_Global_B2\", then ask POI to get you the formula of the cell, it will be returned without the filename, so you'll just get something like \"NR_Global_B2\"\n\nThis seems to be related to how we decode things like NameXPtg / SupBookRecords etc"}]
