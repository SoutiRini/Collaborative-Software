My experience is that these instructions do not\nwork.  Specifically, if I set:\nHeaderName /try.cgi\nAddType text/html .cgi\n\nIt includes the *source* of try.cgi in the output, rather than the result of\nexecuting it.  The cgi runs fine when invoked normally, e.g.,\nhttp://myhost/try.cgi.\n\nI tried other variations: using a /cgi-bin (aka ScriptAlias)\ndirectory, IndexOptions +SuppressHTMLPreamble, mod_rewrite, etc.\nNone worked.\n\nWhat did work was a suggestion from a helpful user on the net: use SSI.  Given\nHeaderName /example.shtml\nthen example.shtml can say, for example,\n<!--#include virtual=\"/try.cgi\"-->\nAnd then try.cgi gets executed and the output gets included before the directory\nlisting.\n(Thread at google in alt.apache.configuration:\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&th=842fe78ad497a6db&rnum=1\n)\n\nJust reporting this in case you wish to change the documentation (and/or code)\naccordingly.\n\nRegards,\nKarl"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "noodl@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 105936, "time": "2007-07-25T04:54:32Z", "bug_id": 31078, "creation_time": "2007-07-25T04:54:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Works for me:\n\n## vhost:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n ServerName test1.local\n DocumentRoot /Users/noodl/Services/www/test1\n AddHandler cgi-script cgi\n AddType text/html cgi\n HeaderName feh.cgi\n <Location />\n  Options Indexes ExecCGI\n </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n## cgi:\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nputs \"Content-Type: text/html\"\nputs\nputs \"woooga\"\n\n\nIt seems likely that you don't have mod_cgi loaded, or you didn't correctly set the cgi handler.
