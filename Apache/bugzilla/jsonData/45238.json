[{"text": "Hi,\n\nwe are having a problem when balancing Tomcat session among to clusters. Architecture is the following: Apache (A) balancing 50-50 over Tomcat (1) and Tomcat (2).\n\nWe are working on a big application and we saw that the session is not replicated properly because we are doing one request for each Tomcat sequentially (see 50-50 balancing) and we have checked that a simple counter that we created inside the session object (our own object) accesing using session.getAttribute(\"name\") the resulted pattern is:\n\nRequest 1 in T1, counter = 1\nRequest 2 in T2, counter = 2\nRequest 3 in T1, counter = 2\nRequest 4 in T2, counter = 3\nRequest 5 in T1, counter = 3\nRequest 6 in T2, counter = 4\nRequest 7 in T1, counter = 4\nRequest 8 in T2, counter = 5\n...\n\nso, the value of the counter is not replicated properly or we are accesing it in a wrong way. Is interesting for us that the Session ID (session.getID()) shows the same ID in both Tomcats so, we guess the is the same but replication of attributes values seems to be not replicated.\n\nCould you please help us?\n\nThan you in advance.", "tags": [], "bug_id": 45238, "attachment_id": null, "count": 0, "id": 117819, "time": "2008-06-19T08:44:56Z", "creator": "rdrumba@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-06-19T08:44:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "rdrumba@gmail.com", "text": "some details: Apache 2.2.3, used mod_proxy_ajp instead of mod_jk, so we did not configured workers.properties file, we customized httpd.conf file.", "id": 117820, "time": "2008-06-19T08:47:04Z", "bug_id": 45238, "creation_time": "2008-06-19T08:47:04Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "text": "An initial reading suggests that this could well be a configuration issue.
