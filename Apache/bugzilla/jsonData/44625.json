When you change this settings for a sampler, the same setting is applied to the others.\n\nI have experienced this with two or more samplers, even when placed under different thread groups.\n\nSPECULATION:\n\nthis seems just a GUI problem. The \"get\" and \"put\" actions are performed correctly, you just cannot have both on the same test Frustrating :)\n\nThanks, ciao\n\nGiacomo", "id": 114705, "time": "2008-03-18T06:58:58Z", "creator": "benelli.giacomo@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2008-03-18T06:58:58Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "text": "Fixed in SVN r642759", "bug_id": 44625, "attachment_id": null, "id": 115111, "time": "2008-03-30T08:25:01Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-03-30T08:25:01Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "text": "*** Bug 44742 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 115280, "time": "2008-04-03T01:26:26Z", "bug_id": 44625, "creation_time": "2008-04-03T01:26:26Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
