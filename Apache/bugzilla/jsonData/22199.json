When the file content exceeds a \nparticular size, we are not able to open the file in MS Excel. The same file \nopens if a few records are reduced. The XLS file is created using a Java \nprogram.\n\nAlso in the same file, when it is in the openable size, a specific cell style \nthat I am applying repeatedly stops getting applied after some loops. Opening \nthe file in MS Excel and applying the same gives a 'No more fonts may be \napplied in this workbook' error.\n\nWe tried using 1.8.0 dev build and it still does not work.\n\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nThanks\nAnand"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22199, "attachment_id": null, "id": 42335, "time": "2003-08-07T14:59:47Z", "creator": "poi-support@buni.org", "creation_time": "2003-08-07T14:59:47Z", "is_private": false, "text": "please try 2.0-pre3 -  this sounds like the concurrency bug."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22199, "attachment_id": null, "id": 43091, "time": "2003-08-21T12:07:28Z", "creator": "anand.iyer@iflexsolutions.com", "creation_time": "2003-08-21T12:07:28Z", "is_private": false, "text": "As mentioned by you we have used version 2.0-pre3.\nThe same problem was coming with this version also.\n\nLater we changed our code to reduce the number of cellstyles and fonts applied \nto a worksheet.\n(The cellstyles and fonts are now applied to a couple of rows and rest of the \nworksheet uses default values.)\nAfter this change our code is working with version  2.0-pre3, but it is still \nnot working with older version and\nis giving the error \"Cannot open file\" for large file size.\n\nSince the version 2.0-pre3 is not a released version we cannot use it in \nproduction.\nCan you please provide the equivalent released version which will solve our \nproblem.\n\nThanks"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 22199, "attachment_id": null, "text": "From the last report, it looks like the actual bug is solved.
