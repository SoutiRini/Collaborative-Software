A configuration\nservice is provided by one of the webapps.  It's\naccessed via a sc = getServletContext() followed by\ncode that uses the sc.getContext()\nto pick up an attribute that's been stored in\na context via getAttribute(\"blat\");\n\nThis works across webapps in 4.0.1 w/o crossContext\nin server.xml but has to have crossContext=\"true\"\nin server.xml in 4.0.2.  That's not the 'bug' I'm\nworking with.\n\nIt works fine from TheDataWeb_X1 and TheDataWeb_X2\nbut _not_ from TheDataWeb.  (following the above\nrules for crossContext).  All I have to do is rename\n'TheDataWeb' to something unique, i.e. 'TheDataWeb_X3'\nand, voila, the configuration information that's \nstored in the attribute is suddenly available the\nway it's been all along for the other, uniquely named,\nwebapps.\n\nI'll be glad to provide any level of code detail.\nThe problem is in both 4.0.1 and 4.0.2.  When\ntesting 4.0.2 I carefully setup crossContext=\"true\"\nfor all webapps in server.xml, including the \nsubstring-not-unique-webapp-named webapp.  The\ncrossContext setup worked for all webapps except\nthe substring-not-unique-webbapp-named webapp.\n\nNote that I'm not sure the crossContext default/setting\nhas anything to do with this problem.\n\n\nHeitzso\nxxh1@cdc.gov or heitzso@bellsouth.net", "id": 11127, "time": "2002-02-25T19:16:03Z", "bug_id": 6662, "creation_time": "2002-02-25T19:16:03Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "remm@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 14602, "time": "2002-04-24T08:40:58Z", "bug_id": 6662, "creation_time": "2002-04-24T08:40:58Z", "tags": [], "text": "Fixed in the 04/25 nightly build.
