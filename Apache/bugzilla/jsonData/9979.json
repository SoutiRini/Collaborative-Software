It does work if an integer (e.g. 1) is placed\ninside the load-on-startup tag -- but the Servlet 2.2/2.3 spec\nsays that you don't need to specify number. It should work w/o\none. Note also, Servlets (as opposed to JSP's) do work fine\nwithout a number. Just a problem with jsp's (from my testing).\nThis bug has an easy workaround, which is to always put a number,\nbut it's annoying if you have a lot of JSP's that you want to preload\nand you have to add a number for all when you really don't care about\nthe order.", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9979, "text": "P.S.
