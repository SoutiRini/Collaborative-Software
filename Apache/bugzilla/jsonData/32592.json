Again, this is why I was confused. There's no definition of  \ngroups in the documentation. At the same time, there's no page for editing Roles.\n\nMaybe, I'm just coming in to Lenya too soon and should wait for 1.4 or 2.0? It seems that all this might \nmake sense to a developer but is not ready for users.
