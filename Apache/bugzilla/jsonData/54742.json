However when I start the program from the command line, the display is correct.\n\nI fork when starting the program since it needs command line arguments.  I tried includeantruntime=false but the java task does not accept this.  I tried both Java 6 and Java 7 on 32 and 64 bit Linux systems.\n\nI believe I have done due diligence in trying to resolve this issue myself.
