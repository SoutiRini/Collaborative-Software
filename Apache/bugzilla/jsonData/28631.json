After some \ninvestigation, I found jakarta-tomcat-catalina/tester/src/bin/tester.xml, which indeed appears to be an \nAnt file that performs out-of-container HTTP testing. So, sure, I can see how, if the container were \nconfigured to use my JAASRealm patch, I could re-test the authentication tests in jakarta-tomcat-\ncatalina/tester/src/tester/org/apache/tester/Authentication0*.java.\n\nSounds simple, but it all turns on the phrase \"if the container were configured to use my JAASRealm \npatch.\" All of the tests use, by default, uses UserDatabaseRealm. How could I make Tomcat use \nJAASRealm instead? It appears that I would need to either:\n- Create a custom context descriptor for the \"tester\" webapp that uses JAASRealm\n- Edit the existing conf/server.xml file\n... as well as cause the test script to bounce the server and re-load it with the new context descriptor. \nAha. To do this, now I need to hack the tester.xml Ant script.\n\nI have *never* written a Tomcat test case before, so this is just my best guess on what it would take. \nAm I wrong?\n\n2) I'm not sure what it would contain. \n\nRemember that JAASRealm needs an implementation of a JAAS LoginModule to function. There isn't one \nsupplied with Tomcat, so this means I'd need to:\n- Create a dummy LoginModule that authenticates certain hard-coded users but not others (e.g., \"Fred/\nbedrock\" but not \"Barney/feet\")\n- Create a \"sample\" LoginModule that authenticates against an existing user registry, like tomcat-\nusers.xml. But that seems like real work to me; I might as well port MemoryRealm to JAAS while I'm at \nit. (Which is essentially what I'd be doing). \n\nFrankly, this seems like a lot of bother for a patch that I *know* works; is has been in production on my \npersonal wiki for about three months. I can do it if you want to, as long as you accept that this means \nthat there will be quite a bit of changes to certain build files, and other things.\n\nWhat is the best path forward? The key issue here is lack of flexibility in the test scripts, which don't \npermit changing Realms for exercising authentication tests."}, {"count": 8, "tags": [], "creator": "yoavs@computer.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 61308, "time": "2004-07-29T13:43:55Z", "bug_id": 28631, "creation_time": "2004-07-29T13:43:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Typical test cases submitted for Tomcat are WAR files.  They contain the code \nto be tested along with the META-INF/context.xml file which is the Context \nelement with the proper declarations, e.g. for a Realm.  Don't bother using the \nTester approach, that's wasted effort on build files.\n\nFor this case a dummy LoginModule with hard-coded user names and passwords is \nfine.  Also for this case, since the Realm has to be in a common classloader \nrepository, a single WAR won't be possible, so maybe a separate JAR.\n\nBasically, we ask for whatever you would use to unit-test your own patch.  I \nunderstand it works for you, and that's great, and if you don't unit-test \nthat's also OK (I sometimes don't do it either, we're not perfect ;)).  But we \ndo prefer to have unit tests before committing into the core Tomcat code.\n\nI also wanted to assess your interest in this: I'm glad you responded, and \nquickly.
