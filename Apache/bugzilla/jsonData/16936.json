But when I write it back it doesn't get saved. If you use this:\n\nExtendedFormatRecord xf = book.workbook.getExFormatAt(record.getXFIndex());\nsetRowStyle(new HSSFCellStyle(( short ) record.getXFIndex(), xf, book));\n \ninstead of \n\n+        ExtendedFormatRecord xf = book.getExFormatAt(record.getXFIndex());\n+        setRowStyle(new HSSFCellStyle(( short ) 0xf, xf))\n\nin the constructor for HSSFRow write back will also work.\n\nThanks\n\n\n"}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "bug_id": 16936, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Patch applied to svn trunk, with a few slight tweaks to make it more HSSFCell like.
