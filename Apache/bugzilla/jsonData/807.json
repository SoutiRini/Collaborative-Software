I\n        can't imagine why it wouldn't be, but that is what I observed.\n        It seems to be run usually the third or fourth time I try it.\n\n        I include the relevant tomcat configuration below.\n\n    Steps to Reproduce:\n        1.  $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/tomcat.sh start\n        2.  $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/tomcat.sh stop\n\n    Actual Results:\n        When you run the stop command, you see the output:\n            Stop tomcat\n        but tomcat continues to run. If you repeat the stop command\n        three or four times, it usually does finally stop.\n\n    Expected Results:\n        I expected it to stop the first time.\n\n    Build Date & Platform\n        We downloaded the following binary distribution:\n            http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v3.2.1/bin/\n            jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1.tar.gz   12-Dec-2000 14:29   2.7M\n            GZIP compressed file\n\n    Additional Builds and Platforms:\n\n        Occurs on:\n            Version 3.2.1 on HPUX\n            Version 3.2.1 on Solaris 2.7\n\n        Doesn't occur on:\n            Version 3.1 (any platform)\n            Version 3.2.1 on Windows NT\n            Version 3.2.1 on Windows 2000\n\n    Additional Information:\n\n        We added a context to server.xml:\n\n            <Context debug=\"0\" docBase=\"/opt/OV/SIP/webapps/ovportal\"\n                path=\"/ovportal\" reloadable=\"true\"/>"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 807, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Just wanted to say that I have the sam problem here.
