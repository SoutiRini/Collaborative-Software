[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 26308, "text": "In 1.6.0 and previous releases of ANT the borland deployment tool does not \nabort the build when errors in the verify procedure are detected. For most \napplications it might be reasonable to abort the procedure, if the verification \nprocedure fails. A deployment of EJB-jars which have not passed verification to \na Borland AppServer will be surely unsuccessful.\n\nThe changes to create this functionality are minimal. An additional \nattribute \"failOnVerifyError\" is added to the \norg/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/ejb/BorlandDeploymentTool.java file with \nappropriate handling of the attribute: if it is set to true, the javaTask or \nexecTask which execute the verification procedure have the failonerror \nattribute set. For backwards compatibility, this attribute is false on default.\n\nThe changes done to the verifyBorlandJarV4 method are tested, those done to the\nverifyBorlandJarV5 method are UNTESTED. This is because we do not have such a \nversion of the Borland AppServer available.\n\nI attach a diff created between the source file BorlandDeploymentTool.java in \nthe 1.6.0 version to a solution created by us. This simply adds the attribute \nand its handling to the class. The diff is suitable as a patch file.", "id": 50873, "time": "2004-01-21T13:10:34Z", "creator": "jarekk@axit.pl", "creation_time": "2004-01-21T13:10:34Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": 10042, "creator": "jarekk@axit.pl", "is_private": false, "id": 50874, "time": "2004-01-21T13:11:32Z", "bug_id": 26308, "creation_time": "2004-01-21T13:11:32Z", "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 10042\npatch to org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/ejb/BorlandDeploymentTool.java file"}]
