A pull request from github with the new \"Weighted Distribution Controller\" with this enhancement will come soon\n\nDescription:\nA controller that randomly selects one of its child elements (samplers/controllers) to be executed. The probability of a child being executed depends upon the relative weight assigned to that element. An expression can be used as a weight, as long as that expression evaluates to a positive integer. The control panel attempts to evaluate any expressions and provides an estimated likelihood of that element being selected.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 194528, "creator": "thorson.little@gmail.com", "time": "2016-10-18T21:19:58Z", "bug_id": 60274, "creation_time": "2016-10-18T21:19:58Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60274, "attachment_id": null, "id": 194939, "time": "2016-11-12T13:38:51Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-11-12T13:38:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "See:\nhttps://github.com/apache/jmeter/pull/233"}]
