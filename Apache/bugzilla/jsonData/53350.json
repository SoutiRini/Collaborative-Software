Then I hold down the <shift> key and click refresh on the page using FireFox to send the \"Cache-Control: no-cache\" request header to get a new copy of the page and clean the server's cache and the page comes back with a 200 at 11:33:18. As long as I don't send the no-cache request I can keep getting the same 403 response out of the cache. \n\nThe cause of the 403 is problematic so I'll include it below.\n\nHow can I help you debug this?\n\n Here's the log file:\n [01/Jun/2012:11:33:09 -0700]    GET /tools/calculate/file-size/result/?size=32&unit=kilobytes HTTP/1.1  403     302     -\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0     -\n [01/Jun/2012:11:33:18 -0700]    GET /tools/calculate/file-size/result/?size=32&unit=kilobytes HTTP/1.1  200     3347    -\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0     \n\n\nWhat's causing the 403? Apache is intermittently issuing a 403 \"Directory index forbidden by Options directive\" but it never should.  For example the two\nbelow links work fine.  But look at the log entry showing the 403 error.  Crazy.  I cannot duplicate the error at all except when the 403 is already in the cache \n\nhttp://www.t1shopper.com/tools/calculate/file-size/result?size=123456789&unit=kilobytes\n\nhttp://www.t1shopper.com/tools/calculate/file-size/result/\n\nHere's error log:\n[Fri Jun 01 11:05:06 2012] [error] [client 71.256.256.256] Directory index forbidden by Options directive:\n/home/t1shopper/www/tools/calculate/file-size/result/\n\nHow can I help you debug this?\n\nPS: We are Linux 2.6.18-308.4.1.el5 x86_64  CentOS release 5.8", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53350, "attachment_id": null, "id": 175050, "time": "2014-05-06T05:13:32Z", "creator": "endeep123@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-05-06T05:13:32Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Is there a fix or a work around for this issue?"}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "gmillikan@t1shopper.com", "is_private": false, "id": 175057, "time": "2014-05-06T17:45:54Z", "bug_id": 53350, "creation_time": "2014-05-06T17:45:54Z", "tags": [], "text": "Although I'm not sure it's been explicitly addressed, we haven't experienced this issue since we upgraded to Apache/2.2.26 so suggest closing this bug for the time being."}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53350, "attachment_id": null, "id": 175062, "time": "2014-05-06T18:30:10Z", "creator": "endeep123@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2014-05-06T18:30:10Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I have tested this with \n\nServer version: Apache/2.4.9 (Unix)\nServer built:   May  5 2014 17:22:05\n\nThe issue still exits.
