It would be nice if Jmeter does the same.\n\nPlease find attached patch for a PoC.\n\nBest regards.\nThomas"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "milamber@apache.org", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 58301 ***", "id": 184854, "time": "2015-08-30T07:56:08Z", "bug_id": 58256, "creation_time": "2015-08-30T07:56:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
