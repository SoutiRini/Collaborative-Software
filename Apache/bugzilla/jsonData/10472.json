The PNGImageEncoder has this parameter, but it cannot be set by the\nRasterizer. Especially, if a conversion to a gray image shall be performed.\n\nJust a minor bug: The documentation of the Rasterizer states, that the -bg\nparameter has 3 or 4 integers to be seperated by a comma. In fact, it is a colon\nwhich is the delimiter.\n\nThanks and best regards\n\nDaniel Stainhauser", "is_private": false, "id": 18999, "creator": "dstainhauser@ionesoft.ch", "time": "2002-07-04T10:10:29Z", "bug_id": 10472, "creation_time": "2002-07-04T10:10:29Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "deweese@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 26709, "time": "2002-11-21T16:17:15Z", "bug_id": 10472, "creation_time": "2002-11-21T16:17:15Z", "text": "The Rasterizer now has '-indexed'.
