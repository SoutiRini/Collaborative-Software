Since the purpose of the streaming workbook API is to have a lower memory footprint and not speed, this seems like a good tradeoff.\n\n[1] https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/poi-dev/201511.mbox/%3CCABdJj57-Z1sMtdTXdTj8-r_PJ2TmRFHJ%3DM2RfHUU49hiATgW7Q%40mail.gmail.com%3E"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Added in r1717192 and r1717195.
