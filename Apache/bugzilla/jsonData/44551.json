This was never back ported to the 1.2.X branch.\n\nPart 2)\nThe 1.2.X version of SocketAppender supports an application property which chainsaw can read to specify which application the log is for.  SocketHubAppender should also support this functionality.\n\nThe attached patch resolves these issues.\n\nThanks to Scott Deboy for his guidance.", "attachment_id": 21644, "id": 114373, "creator": "jason.tholstrup@gmail.com", "time": "2008-03-06T12:15:24Z", "bug_id": 44551, "creation_time": "2008-03-06T12:15:24Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44551, "is_private": false, "id": 114393, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "psmith@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-03-06T18:49:05Z", "time": "2008-03-06T18:49:05Z", "text": "This patch looks good to me, I can't see any reason not to apply it.\n\nScott?  any final comments?"}, {"count": 2, "text": "Looks good to me as well.\n\nThanks for the contribution Jason", "creator": "sdeboy@iname.com", "is_private": false, "id": 114394, "time": "2008-03-06T20:53:21Z", "bug_id": 44551, "creation_time": "2008-03-06T20:53:21Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Patch applied as of revision 634545.\n\nThanks muchly.", "attachment_id": null, "id": 114395, "creator": "psmith@apache.org", "time": "2008-03-06T21:44:00Z", "bug_id": 44551, "creation_time": "2008-03-06T21:44:00Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "text": "Can we presume that the Apache Contributor Agreement has been signed and is on file at the foundation?\n\nJake", "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "is_private": false, "id": 114397, "time": "2008-03-06T21:51:51Z", "bug_id": 44551, "creation_time": "2008-03-06T21:51:51Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "text": "I thought that if a person attached their contribution to bugzilla that was implied donation to Apache?", "attachment_id": null, "id": 114398, "creator": "psmith@apache.org", "time": "2008-03-06T22:08:57Z", "bug_id": 44551, "creation_time": "2008-03-06T22:08:57Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "creator": "sdeboy@iname.com", "is_private": false, "text": "I agree with Paul..I don't think a CLA is required for submitted patches.", "id": 114400, "time": "2008-03-06T22:24:17Z", "bug_id": 44551, "creation_time": "2008-03-06T22:24:17Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 7, "tags": [], "creator": "hoju@visi.com", "is_private": false, "text": "My misunderstanding.
