If I set a String value in a cell with leading and trailing spaces, the value seems to be preserved in the XML, but does not display in Excel.\nFor example:\nXSSFCell cell = row.createCell(0);\ncell.setCellValue(\"   XYZ   \");\n\nYields <si><t>   XYZ   </t></si> in sharedStrings.xml but does not display the spaces in Excel.\n\nIf you just type the value in Excel you get\n<si><t xml:space=\"preserve\">    XYZ    </t></si> \n\nPOI should have some way of preserving these spaces.\n\nThanks"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "yegor@dinom.ru", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Fixed in r830492\n\nThe fix looks easy on the surface but it took quite a while to understand how to do it with XmlBeans. xml:space=\"preserve\" belongs to the Official XML Namespace  (http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace) and XmlBeans does not generate get/set accessors to it. It turned out that the only way to set this attribute is via XmlCursor, see the patch.\n\nYegor", "id": 131450, "time": "2009-10-28T03:44:12Z", "bug_id": 48070, "creation_time": "2009-10-28T03:44:12Z", "is_private": false}]
