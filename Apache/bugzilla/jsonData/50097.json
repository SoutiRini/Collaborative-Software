In thread group set Action to be taken on Stop Thread\n2. Add a transaction controller with in it a HTTP Request that will fail (e.g. because a embedded resource is not avaiable).\n3. Run the test (both GUI and non-gui)\n\nExpected result:\nThe failed transaction is shown in the listeners (e.g. Summary Report, Results Tree).\n\nActual Result:\nThe failed transaction is not shown in any log (except a 404 warning message in jmeter.log). If the HTTP Request is outside the transaction then it does show up in the listeners.\n\nBuild & Platform:\nApache JMeter version 2.4 r961953\nTested on Windows XP SP 3 & Windows Server 2003 x64 SP2", "id": 140759, "time": "2010-10-15T05:11:48Z", "bug_id": 50097, "creation_time": "2010-10-15T05:11:48Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 50097, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hello,\n\nThis bug was disappeared with the patch for Bug 30563.\n(at run() method from JMeterThread.java file)\n\nWith JMeter nightly build, this bug isn't reproducible\n\nI change this to Fixed (rather than Duplicate)", "id": 140786, "time": "2010-10-17T08:06:35Z", "creator": "milamber@apache.org", "creation_time": "2010-10-17T08:06:35Z", "is_private": false}]
