Also the uppercase \"SUCCESS\". Even combined with underlines before and after the word (see example 4 and 5).\n\n\nHowever, if there is another word (like OCF_SUCCESS) the word isn't hyphenated at all anymore. I don't know if this is an expected behaviour or an issue in the hyphenation patterns. Interestingly, XEP from RenderX hyphenates it as \"OCF_SUC-CESS\".
