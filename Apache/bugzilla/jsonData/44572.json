It describes a roundabout, self-described kludge, which I believe is totally unnecessary. I quote:\n\n> Usually the Apache kernels URL escape function also escapes anchors, i.e. URLs\n> like \"url#anchor\". You cannot use this directly on redirects with mod_rewrite\n> because the uri_escape() function of Apache would also escape the hash \n> character. How can we redirect to such a URL?\n> Solution:\n>     We have to use a kludge by the use of a NPH-CGI script which does the \n> redirect itself. \n\nI achieved the desired effect by simply adding [NE] to a rewrite rule.\n\nThis removes the need for any separate script to do the forwarding.\n\nThe solution in the documentation seems very strange.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong.", "id": 114462, "time": "2008-03-10T06:46:09Z", "bug_id": 44572, "creation_time": "2008-03-10T06:46:09Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44572, "attachment_id": null, "text": "That recipe has been removed from the new rewrite guide at\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/\n\nI've now deprecated the old guide.\n\nThanks.", "id": 114495, "time": "2008-03-11T10:48:41Z", "creator": "slive@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-03-11T10:48:41Z", "is_private": false}]
