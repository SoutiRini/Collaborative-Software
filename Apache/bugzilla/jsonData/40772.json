[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40772, "text": "I've working with jmeter and I noticed a small problem when loading\njtl files back into a listener. The problem relates to empty tokens in\nthe jtl. \n\nI'm working with JMeter 2.2, JDBC Samplers and Summary report. The jtl\nfile looks this way and was created with the Summary Report listener\n\n1160833236328,62,Prepared update,,,Grupo de Hilos 1-1,text,true\n1160833236406,0,Prepared Select,,,Grupo de Hilos 1-1,text,true\n1160833236406,31,Callable Query,,,Grupo de Hilos 1-1,text,true\n1160833236437,16,Callable update,,,Grupo de Hilos 1-1,text,true\n1160833236453,0,Prepared update,,,Grupo de Hilos 1-1,text,true\n\n\nNotice the \",,,\" part.  Well, when I try to load this jtl file to the same\nlistener it says it cannot load it. I traced the problem to the StringTokeniker\nused in OldSaveService.java at line 142. StringTokenizer silently ignores\nempty tokens and the result is that the JTL is not parsed right.\n\nThe workaround is to configure the listener to not save the response code nor\nthe message but I think that the JTL parsing should support the empty fields as\nit provides a better user experience. (so the user is not forced to deal with\nstrange errors when it tries to load the file he just generated a second before).", "id": 94878, "time": "2006-10-16T23:48:56Z", "creator": "ruben.laguna@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-16T23:48:56Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40772, "attachment_id": 19010, "id": 94879, "time": "2006-10-16T23:51:41Z", "creator": "ruben.laguna@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-10-16T23:51:41Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 19010\nPatch to support empty tokens in jtl files \n\nUses a wrapper around StringTokenizer"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "text": "Thanks for the report and patch - in the end I used String.split().\n\nThe code in SVN branch 2.2 has been fixed, and is in the nightly build:\n\n2-2.20061020", "id": 95032, "time": "2006-10-20T16:37:08Z", "bug_id": 40772, "creation_time": "2006-10-20T16:37:08Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40772, "attachment_id": null, "id": 105138, "time": "2007-07-06T05:49:26Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-07-06T05:49:26Z", "is_private": false, "text": "*** Bug 42800 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"}]
