The parsing code looks for the next =-sign first and then retracts back to find the beginning of the key (such as \"username\"). The current code skips before the very first key into uninitialized memory.\n\nThe attached patch also adds a tiny bit of const-poisoning and the inclusion of <sybfront.h>, which is necessary, when compiling against real Sybase headers rather than FreeTDS (though FreeTDS supplies the header too).\n\nBut the actual bug-fix is in the third (last) hunk of the patch.", "id": 161156, "time": "2012-08-07T16:45:45Z", "bug_id": 53676, "creation_time": "2012-08-07T16:45:45Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "mi+apache@aldan.algebra.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 53666 ***", "id": 161239, "time": "2012-08-10T16:02:38Z", "bug_id": 53676, "creation_time": "2012-08-10T16:02:38Z", "is_private": false}]
