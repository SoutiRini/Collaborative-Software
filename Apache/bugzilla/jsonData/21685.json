I've checked\nhttp://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apache-1.3/conf/httpd.conf-dist\nand could not see the line with \".eo\". So I assume the modification is not yet\nin the 1.3 branch (I am not an Apache expert so I might have looked at the wrong\nfile, if so, accept my apologises).\n\nWhy 1.3, you ask? Well, there are still lots of 1.3.x servers today, most (if\nnot all) of them not being \"aware\" about files ending with \".eo\". So if you\ncould fix this problem in the 1.3 branch, then Apache 1.3.29+ would be fine too\n(like 2.0.49+ I hope), and I would have a little more chance that my own \".eo\"\npages be returned to the people who prefer esperanto than other languages.\nObviously, I've asked the guys who host my website to do this modification on\ntheir server, but they have an internal policy which disallow them to modify the\nconfiguration, *except* with official updates. So maybe they would install\n1.3.29 and this would solve my problem at the same time... :-)\n\nThanks.\nGreg", "count": 2, "id": 43705, "time": "2003-09-04T09:33:28Z", "creator": "xjogg@trashmail.net", "creation_time": "2003-09-04T09:33:28Z", "is_private": false}]
