Execution of transform() function is causing CPU to reach at 100% utilization during image rendering. So during continuous Image rendering requests, the CPU usage remains around 100% that stopped other applications to continue their work on that system. We also tried the same using FOP command line but get similar results.\nIn fop.xconf we are using following settings:\n1. tiff image compression type as CCITT T.6 \n2. DPI as 200dpi.\n3. default-page-settings as height=\"3.625in\" and width=\"8.5in\"/>\n \nThis problem is not specific to particular XML and XSL-FO. \n\nWe are looking for a fix in FOP so that CPU utilization can be reduced during execution of transform() function.\n \nDo let me know in case other information is required."}]
