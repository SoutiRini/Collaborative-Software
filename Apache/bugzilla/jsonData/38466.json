You don't have\nto use a module. And if you use a module, it's not required to have the same\nname as the resource type - you can e.g. provide several resource types in a\nsingle module. That's why the resource type has to be able to declare arbitrary\nview URLs.", "id": 85390, "time": "2006-02-03T17:30:29Z", "creator": "andreas@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-02-03T17:30:29Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 5, "tags": [], "creator": "thorsten@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 105524, "time": "2007-07-16T01:59:03Z", "bug_id": 38466, "creation_time": "2007-07-16T01:59:03Z", "text": "Renaming Lenya 1.4 to 2.0"}]
