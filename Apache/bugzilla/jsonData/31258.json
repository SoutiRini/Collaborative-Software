For \nexample (in a .properties file):\n\nbuild.compiler=jikes\n\nbuild.compiler.executable=T:/tools/jikes/1.20/bin/jikes\n\nThis would be better than setting the PATH environment variable so that `jikes` \nresolves to the desired version, in two ways: it eases maintenance, by placing \nrelated parameters together; and it's less apt to have undesired side-effects \nsuch as causing child scripts or <ant> invocations to run a different compiler.\n\nThis could be implemented in Javac.getExecutable, but perhaps that's a bad idea.", "id": 63652, "time": "2004-09-16T05:14:44Z", "creator": "jkristian@openharbor.com", "creation_time": "2004-09-16T05:14:44Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
