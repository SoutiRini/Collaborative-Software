If the server has a file named \"a&b.txt\", it will only display as \"a\" on my webdav client and it's not accessible.\nWhen I look into it, I notice the root cause it the response package of PROPFIND request.  \"a&b.txt\" is refered to \"a&amp;b\" in that package.\nThen I trace into source code and it turned out it is by design in apr_xml_quote_string to quote \"&\" into \"&amp\" instead of \"%26\".\nI think there must be some reason to quote \"&\" like that but it really break my usage."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48201, "is_private": false, "text": "This is one of the numerous bugs of the MS Webdavclient(s).
