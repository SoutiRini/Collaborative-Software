I have attached a screenshot for illustration. Here is the configuration for rotatelogs.exe inside httpd.conf: \n\nErrorLog \"|bin/rotatelogs logs/error.log 100M\"\n\nCustomLog \"|bin/rotatelogs logs/access.log 100M\" common\n\nErrorLog \"|bin/rotatelogs logs/secure_error.log 100M\"\nCustomLog \"|bin/rotatelogs logs/secure_access.log 100M\" common\n\nAnother issue, which I have not been able to replicate, when I enter this into a different httpd.conf file on a different server, it seems to rotate the logs every circa 2 mins, not at 100M. I am unable to find anything different in the config. \n\nRegards"}]
