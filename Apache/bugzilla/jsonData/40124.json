So I decided to set the \"ignore\" flag on the element in the tree pane. The\neffect is, that this part of the tree is faded out immediately. \nBut when restarting the appllication - the configuration including the \"ignores\"\nis saved - the configuration is read and in the tree pane one will see the\n\"ignored\" parts, but inside the log output also ignored entries will be shown.\n\nWorkaround: Click on the \"ignored\" item or the root in the tree pane. Afterthat,\nthe \"ignores\" work correctly."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 40124, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 135717, "time": "2010-03-28T04:25:36Z", "creator": "sdeboy@iname.com", "creation_time": "2010-03-28T04:25:36Z", "text": "This has been fixed in svn 824604 - 'ignore' was only working if a logger was selected, ignore was also not ignoring sub-loggers"}]
