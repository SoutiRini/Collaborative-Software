This is in SSL_X509_getBC() function of ssl_util_ssl.c. At least on Windows, this crashes when mod_ssl and OpenSSL are built against different C run-times.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n    1) Configure httpd to use an SSL certificate with the basicConstraints extension containing a pathlen (sample cert attached).\n\n    2) Start the server.\n\nActual Results:\n\n    The server crashed.\n\nExpected Results:\n\n    The server starts, using the configured certificate.\n\nBuild Date & Hardware:\n\n    64-bit Windows build of httpd/mod_ssl 2.4.7 using msvc 11.0\n    and OpenSSL 1.0.1 built with msvc 9.0\n\nAdditional Builds and Platforms:\n\n    I have verified that free() is still used in trunk.", "id": 181711, "time": "2015-03-12T19:39:58Z", "creator": "paul.spangler@ni.com", "creation_time": "2015-03-12T19:39:58Z", "attachment_id": 32562}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "ylavic.dev@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 181713, "time": "2015-03-12T20:50:53Z", "bug_id": 57694, "creation_time": "2015-03-12T20:50:53Z", "text": "Thanks, fixed in r1666297."}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 57694, "text": "This is part of the (unreleased) 2.4.13\nbackport in r1673940", "id": 183778, "time": "2015-06-27T07:24:13Z", "creator": "christophe.jaillet@wanadoo.fr", "creation_time": "2015-06-27T07:24:13Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
