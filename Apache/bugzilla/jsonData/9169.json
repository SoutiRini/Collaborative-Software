Note that this \nproblem does not manifest itself on *all* platforms (for example, I believe \nsomeone said it works fine on Solaris).  It does this on at least Linux as well \n(and now OSX according to you, thanks for mentioning that).  The problem is \nthat the apr_thread_join call doesn't seem to work right or ever return on \nthose platforms (possibly a busted pthread library??), so the child process \nsits around doing nothing until the parent process gives up on it and kills it.\n\nWe will clean this up in a future release.
