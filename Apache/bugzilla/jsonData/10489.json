I have posted the problem\non comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and got no replies.  I dont believe that \nthe problem is a configuration issue (in as much as I have been trying to start \nwith my older config settings etc. where SSI works fine, and using them with the \nnew config settings for the 2.0.39 release).  I have it set up to parse all htm \npages, since they all contain headers and\nfooters referenced via includes.\n\n\n\nI can get ssi working fine for all html documents in my document root tree, \nEXCEPT for a document named index.htm at root of the tree.  \n\nIf I copy /index.htm  to /index2.htm (or any other name) the SSI directives are \nprocessed, but not if the file is titled index.htm at root. \n\nIf I copy index.htm down to a subdirectory,  SSI directives get processed there \nas well just fine. \n\nIt just is not parsing the includes at the root level for that single\nfile called index.htm\n\n\nrelevant portions of my new httpd.conf file are:\n\n\n<Directory \"/wwwadmin/test_web_docs\">\n\n     Options Includes FollowSymLinks\n\tSetOutputFilter INCLUDES\n\n        AllowOverride None\n\torder allow,deny\n\tallow from XXX\n\tdeny from *\n\t\n</Directory>\n\n\n\nand later on....\n\nAddType text/html .html\nAddType text/html .htm\nAddOutputFilter INCLUDES .htm\n\nCould this effect be due to conflict or processing being intercepted by another\nmodule?\n\nThanks in advance for looking at this.", "id": 19016, "time": "2002-07-04T20:57:30Z", "bug_id": 10489, "creation_time": "2002-07-04T20:57:30Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 10489, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Also forgot to mention that I also tried it with a build using the default \nmodules included, and the prob. was the same.\n\n", "id": 19020, "time": "2002-07-04T23:01:02Z", "creator": "brant.bady@gems6.gov.bc.ca", "creation_time": "2002-07-04T23:01:02Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "[This is a mass bug update.]\nThis bug reports a problem in an older version of Apache 2.\nCould you please update to the most recent version and see\nif you can reproduce this problem.
