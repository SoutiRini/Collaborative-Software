The issue is actually to do with the way different platforms handle leading slashes in a list of words supplied to the includes attribute.\n\nSo, if includes=\"/2001/*.* /2002/*.* /2003/*.*\" then on Windows this will match subdirectories with the matching names e.e.g  somesubdir/2001/*.* but on Linux it does not.
