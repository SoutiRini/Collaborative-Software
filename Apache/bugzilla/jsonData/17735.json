[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 17735, "text": "I've noticed that upgrading to 1.5.2 seems to have \"broken\" one of my ftp \ntasks. The ftp task in question uploads a several levels deep directory \nstructure to a remote system. This always worked fine in the past, but in Ant \n1.5.2, I get the following:\n\nBUILD FAILED\nfile:C:/master/starman/build/build.xml:1588: could not change to directory: 550\nstarnode\\admin: No such file or directory.\n\nThe issue is caused by the fact that I don't explicitly create all the \ndirectories on the remote system, only the top level directory, and in the \npast, Ant seemed to just generate the remote sub-directories under the top \nlevel directory as needed during the transfer on the fly. Is this something to \ndo with separators ('/' Vs. '\\') being changed in Ant 1.5.2? It looks like the \nfact that it's coming from Window$ and going to Unix and the separators is the \nissue, but this was never a problem in the past...", "id": 32581, "time": "2003-03-06T18:11:38Z", "creator": "matt@stargus.com", "creation_time": "2003-03-06T18:11:38Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "conor@apache.org", "text": "OK, I will have a fix soon.
