This was added in r1142219 as a fix for bug 48294.\n\nTo differentiate a sheet move from a row move, I think a more appropriate name for this method is adjustPtgDueToSheetMove. This also aligns the name with the public static createForSheetShift method.\n\nBecause this method is private, it shouldn't affect any other files or existing code.", "id": 185397, "time": "2015-09-21T20:49:13Z", "creator": "onealj@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-09-21T20:49:13Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 58439, "text": "Implemented in r1710147 <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1710147>.\n\nDeployed to trunk.", "id": 185873, "time": "2015-10-23T09:01:36Z", "creator": "onealj@apache.org", "creation_time": "2015-10-23T09:01:36Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
