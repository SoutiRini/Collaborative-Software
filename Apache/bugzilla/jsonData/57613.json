This has been a great addition for WebDAV testing but the CalDAV standard (RFC 4791) adds 2 new methods, REPORT and MKCALENDAR.  Attached is a patch based on the 2.12 source that adds support for these. REPORT is also useful for CardDAV testing.\n\nMy team has been using this patch successfully in our testing.  Can it be added to jmeter?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Date: Fri Feb 20 20:57:37 2015\nNew Revision: 1661219\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/r1661219\nLog:\nBug 57613 - HTTP Sampler : Added CalDAV verbs (REPORT, MKCALENDAR)\nBugzilla Id: 57613\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/protocol/http/org/apache/jmeter/protocol/http/sampler/HTTPSamplerBase.java\n    jmeter/trunk/src/protocol/http/org/apache/jmeter/protocol/http/util/HTTPConstantsInterface.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/usermanual/component_reference.xml", "attachment_id": null, "id": 181222, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2015-02-20T20:58:23Z", "bug_id": 57613, "creation_time": "2015-02-20T20:58:23Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "text": "Date: Fri Feb 20 21:29:08 2015\nNew Revision: 1661229\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/r1661229\nLog:\nBug 57613 - HTTP Sampler : Added CalDAV verbs (REPORT, MKCALENDAR)\nBugzilla Id: 57613\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/protocol/http/org/apache/jmeter/protocol/http/sampler/HttpWebdav.java", "is_private": false, "id": 181224, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2015-02-20T21:29:29Z", "bug_id": 57613, "creation_time": "2015-02-20T21:29:29Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\nThanks for patch.\nPlease note there was some missing part in implementation, I am surprised that patch worked as it was.\nI fixed it , could you test with upcoming nightly build ?\nThanks", "is_private": false, "id": 181225, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "time": "2015-02-20T21:30:43Z", "bug_id": 57613, "creation_time": "2015-02-20T21:30:43Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 57613, "is_private": false, "id": 181229, "time": "2015-02-21T09:48:33Z", "creator": "felix.schumacher@internetallee.de", "creation_time": "2015-02-21T09:48:33Z", "tags": [], "text": "(In reply to Philippe Mouawad from comment #3)\n> Hi,\n> Thanks for patch.\n> Please note there was some missing part in implementation, I am surprised\n> that patch worked as it was.\n> I fixed it , could you test with upcoming nightly build ?\n> Thanks\n\nTo be fair, the missing part was part of the original patch."}, {"count": 5, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 57613, "is_private": false, "id": 181230, "time": "2015-02-21T10:20:12Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2015-02-21T10:20:12Z", "tags": [], "text": "(In reply to Felix Schumacher from comment #4)\n> (In reply to Philippe Mouawad from comment #3)\n> > Hi,\n> > Thanks for patch.\n> > Please note there was some missing part in implementation, I am surprised\n> > that patch worked as it was.\n> > I fixed it , could you test with upcoming nightly build ?\n> > Thanks\n> \n> To be fair, the missing part was part of the original patch.\n\nOups sorry , it was me, I misread the diff, thanks for check Felix..\n\n@Richard thanks for patch and no more comment :-)"}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 57613, "attachment_id": null, "id": 181240, "time": "2015-02-23T03:41:55Z", "creator": "richard.brigham@teamaol.com", "creation_time": "2015-02-23T03:41:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "That change worked perfectly in the nightly build.
