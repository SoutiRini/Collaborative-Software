By the time a developer realises that\nthe gzip functionality is broken in this way, various caches will hold the wrong\ncontent possibly for long periods of time even once gzip is turned off again.\n\nI suggest putting a warning in the server.xml against using gzip negotiation if\nyou are already using vary headers until this bug gets fixed."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 39402, "attachment_id": 18424, "is_private": false, "id": 89897, "time": "2006-06-07T17:19:32Z", "creator": "mpcooke3@hotmail.com", "creation_time": "2006-06-07T17:19:32Z", "text": "Created attachment 18424\nA patch that fixes the overwriting vary header bug\n\nThis change checks for existing Vary headers and will add to any existing\nvalues in the Vary header.
