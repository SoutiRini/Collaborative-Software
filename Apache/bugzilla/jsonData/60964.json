There are two unrelated effects that cause this:\n\n1) If we're not logging against a server_rec (or the server_rec is NULL), the core logging code refuses to log anything above ap_default_loglevel, unless it's a NOTICE or the server has been compiled with -DDEBUG.\n\n2) If we are logging against a server_rec, the LogLevel directive will still not have been parsed by the time EXEC_ON_READ directives are being run. So DEFAULT_LOGLEVEL will be the highest level possible.\n\nThis seems to affect only LoadModule and LoadFile, which try to log what files they're loading at DEBUG level. It would have affected mod_remoteip's RemoteIPTrustedProxyList and RemoteIPInternalProxyList, if ap_pcfg_openfile's debug logging weren't already wrapped in an #ifdef DEBUG."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "jchampion@apache.org", "text": "Note that the default loglevel can be explicitly set with -e.
