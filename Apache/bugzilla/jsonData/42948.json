I can sort of get focus to an entry where I can\nappend to an existing entry or use the backspace key to delete from the end. But\nI can't edit in the middle of an existing entry.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open JMeter\n2. Right-click WorkBench, Add, Non-Test Elements, HTTP Proxy Server\n3. Under URL Patterns to Include, click Add\n4. Click the JTable cell, type \"abc\"\n5. Click another component (e.g., Port)\n6. Click that same cell in the Include list between the \"b\" and the \"c\".\n7. Note lack of blinking cursor\n8. Type \"zzz\".\n9. Note that the insertion happened at the end, not between \"b\" and \"c\".\n10.Use the left-arrow key to try to move the cursor earlier in the \"abczzz\" string.\n11.Type \"yyy\".\n12.Note that the insertion happened at the end, despite your left-arrow attempts.\n\nThis bug appears to also exist in 2.3RC3.\n\nThis bug appears to not exist running on Mac OS 10.4.
