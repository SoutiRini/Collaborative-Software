Access the URL. Mozilla makes\nrepeated requests and finally pops up a dialog saying: \"Redirection limit for\nthis URL exceeded. Unable to load the requested page.\"\n\nI suspect the problem is caused by mod_proxy encoding the tilde characters in\nthe URL. Watching the HTTP traffic with and without the proxy reveals that\nMozilla sends the tilde unencoded and Apache encodes it with the corresponding\npercent sequence, which the remote website seems to find confusing. The website\nkeeps sending redirections to the browser until the browser gives up.\n\nI believe Apache proxy should send the URL in exactly the same format it\nreceived it. This might violate the RFC, but it would minimize interoperability\nproblems like this."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "nick@webthing.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 60034, "time": "2004-06-29T06:46:03Z", "bug_id": 19317, "creation_time": "2004-06-29T06:46:03Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Patch committed to HEAD; c.f. bug 15207"}]
