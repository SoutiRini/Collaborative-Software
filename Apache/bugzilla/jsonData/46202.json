One could use something like the @since javadoc keyword for stating newly introduced features, but I'm not sure if this can become confusing for users.\n\nI also like the idea of only stating the relevant differences of trunk vs. last release, but this means that changes need to be tracked down whenever a new version is released...\n\nI'm comfortable with any of these, please post your opinion(s) and I'll try to review the patch whenever possible.\n\n\n> If you could create a separate patch and attach it to that bug, that would be\n> better I think.\n\nOK, I'll take a look at that whenever possible. ;-)", "attachment_id": null, "id": 125552, "creator": "helder.magalhaes@gmail.com", "time": "2009-03-13T10:44:35Z", "bug_id": 46202, "creation_time": "2009-03-13T10:44:35Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 6, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46202, "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #0)\n> The proposed changes include:\n> \n>  * Reflect Java 1.3 support removed\n>    * (revision 666001)\n>  * Add JRE as an alternative requirement and add note for JDK regarding\n> compilation\n>    * (only JDK was listed as requirement in \"faq.xml\")\n>    * (clearing JDK need for compilation, although intuitive for advanced users,\n> can be useful for starters)\n\nDone in revision 1004565.\n\n\n>  * Missing documentation for window.postURL\n>    * (already implemented for a while, just not documented [1])\n>  * Missing documentation for window.location\n>    * (recently implemented [2], revisions 712954, 712955)\n\nDone in revision 1004572.\n\n\n>  * Mention Window Object [3] standard\n>    * (within the scripting support, \"status.xml\")\n\nReworked to use the proper SVG 1.2 Tiny DOM interface instead.\n\n\n>  * References to Batik version 1.6 changed to 1.7\n>    * (although only used for example purposes, 1.7 is around for a while)\n\nReverted this: using 1.6 for examples is fine.\n\n\n(In reply to comment #4)\n> Duplicating all of the documentation for trunk vs release doesn't seem like a\n> nice way to present it, IMO.
