There is some problem when I open the file \"newfile.xls\"\n  1. When I open \"newfile.xls\" by MS Office 2003, I got the message: \"File\nerror: data may have been lost\" before I am able to completely open the file.\nBut some cells (from F57 to L57) in sheet \"Generator\" can't show exactly value\nlike the origin input file \"testcase.xls\".\n  2. I try to open by Open Office 3.0.0, there are many cells not able to show\nexactly value like the origin file.
