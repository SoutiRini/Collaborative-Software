This is useful for load testing sites whose logs include behaviors that would differ across users.  The test environment can be updated such that everyone's password is \"skeleton\" and authentication will be performed appropriately.  \n\nThis is achieved without patching any existing jmeter source.  \n\nAlso included is a FilterChain which allows specifying multiple filters as properties and calls them all (in no particular order), i.e.\n\n# use cookies per ip (session) and basic auth\naccesslog.sampler.filterchain.1=org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.SkeletonAuthorizationFilter\naccesslog.sampler.filterchain.2=org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.SessionFilter\n\nPS:  someone should add the ability for the log parsers to stop the test when they hit the end of the file\n\nPPS: i had to implement TestCloneable on these Filters otherwise they would be silently ignored by AccessLogSampler  This is bad behavior and potentially a bug, as LogFilter does not implement it.", "bug_id": 46237, "is_private": false, "id": 122612, "time": "2008-11-18T18:48:26Z", "creator": "ej@ir.iit.edu", "creation_time": "2008-11-18T18:48:26Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 22889}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "ej@ir.iit.edu", "attachment_id": 23037, "is_private": false, "id": 123405, "time": "2008-12-18T09:56:06Z", "bug_id": 46237, "creation_time": "2008-12-18T09:56:06Z", "text": "Created attachment 23037\nupdated version that grabs the username regexp from a property"}]
