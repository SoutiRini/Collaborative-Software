The attached patch \nagainst the current HEAD revision makes it\n \n- log POST and PUT requests\n \n- report the number of bytes *received* for POST and PUT in %b\n \nThe latter is in contradiction to the Apache logfile docs but from what I see in \nApache logs on the web (I don't run Apache myself) this is what Apache actually \ndoes.  In addition, it is what I need.  What use is the number of *sent* bytes \nin that case (always 0)?\n\nI already posted this directly to tomcat-dev.\n\nMichael", "id": 46285, "time": "2003-10-25T22:38:46Z", "creator": "lemkemch@t-online.de", "creation_time": "2003-10-25T22:38:46Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "lemkemch@t-online.de", "attachment_id": 8737, "text": "Created attachment 8737\nEnable logging of POST/PUT requests and report the number of bytes received.", "id": 46286, "time": "2003-10-25T22:41:56Z", "bug_id": 24123, "creation_time": "2003-10-25T22:41:56Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 24123, "text": "Patch committed. \n\nThanks much!", "id": 46287, "time": "2003-10-26T01:22:57Z", "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "creation_time": "2003-10-26T01:22:57Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
