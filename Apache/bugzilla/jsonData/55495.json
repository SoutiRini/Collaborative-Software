To recreate it, simple create a variable named something like \"myVar_0\" and then call the ForEach Controller with a start index of 0. Because there is no \"myVar_1\", the ForEach Controller will not run.\n\nThe documentation does clearly state that if <variable>_1 is null, the looper will not run. My impression is that this is a legacy, default value from before start and end indices existed. I feel that a more intuitive solution would be to check the start index and, if not given, default to 1. Then, loop until the variable returned is null."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55495, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 169780, "time": "2013-08-28T17:10:26Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2013-08-28T17:10:26Z", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 55201 ***"}]
