Add simple expressions (even if it's just equals):\n<target name=\"jar\"\n        depends=\"compile\"\n        if=\"jar.file = true\">\n\nor\n\n<target name=\"jar\"\n        depends=\"compile\"\n        if=\"jar.file != true\">\n\nor perhaps nested elements (which feels more ant-like somehow):\n\n<target name=\"jar\"\n        depends=\"compile\">\n   <ifequals property=\"name\" value=\"value\"/>\n   <unlessequals property=\"name\" value=\"value\"/>\n   ...\n</target>\n    \n\nFor target, document whether if/unless is evaluated before the depends \nattribute. So if (as above) jar depends on compile, there are two choices if \nthe if statement is false:\nChoice 1: do nothing\nChoice 2: execute compile, but do not execute jar\n\n2. Allow multiple properties (and expressions) in if and unless, separated by \ncommas or semicolons: a comma means 'and', a semi-colon means 'or'. Or maybe \nexpressions can understand && and ||, with comma falling back to mean 'and'.\n\n3. Expand the list of tasks that understand if/unless (perhaps make it a \ngeneral machanism), to include filesets, zipfilesets, filtersets, fail, \nproperty. This would allow more power within targets.\n\n4. Add if/unless to the outer level of patternsets: the whole patternset \nbecomes empty if the expression is true, else the patternset falls back to \nevaluating if/unless on each nested element.", "id": 8192, "time": "2001-11-22T05:26:49Z", "bug_id": 5034, "creation_time": "2001-11-22T05:26:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Check the new <condition> task in a recent nightly build and see if it answers \nyour problems.\n\nI'm setting this bug to fixed.\nIf everything is OK, please close it, otherwise feel free to reopen it with \nadditional details about your request.
