Here are the\nsteps to reproduce this error:\n\n1.  Open up Mozilla 1.6.\n2.  Go to a Lenya installation and login as an admin to one publication (labeled\nhere as X)\n3.  Add a new user (using username, full name, email address, and password)\n4.  Log out of publication X.\n5.  Without closing browser, login as an admin into another publication (labeled\nhere as Y)\n6.  Add a new user using the same criteria as in step 3 above.\n7.  Publication Y will not allow the new user, stating that the user already exists.\n\nClosing the Mozilla web browser and opening it back up, logging into Publication\nY and adding the user again produces no errors.
