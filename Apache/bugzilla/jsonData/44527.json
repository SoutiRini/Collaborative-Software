With PDF files, the new window opens and displays a blank page.  With MS-Word, notepad \u2026, an error occurs saying (translated in English) : Internet Explorer cannot download the file xxxxx from xxxxx.  The page requested is unavailable or cannot be found.\n\nCode example :\n\nfunction ouvrir (pdf) {\n\twindow.open (pdf, 'fenetre', 'location=no,menubar=yes,resizable=yes') ;\n}\n\n<a href=\"javascript:ouvrir('prt/<%= pdfName %>')<%= pdfName %></a>\n\n\nSome tests show the following :\n\n-\tThe problem occurs equally with IE7 and IE6.\n-\tshowModalDialog does not work neither.\n\nThe problem does not occur : \n\n-\tif window.open () is used to open a simple HTML (or a JSP) page.\n-\tIf the document opens in the current page <a href=\u201dxxx\u201d>\n-\tIf window.open () is replaced by <a href=\u201dxxx\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d>.\n\nOne thing is sure : if the security constraints are removed (I am using JDNDIRealm ldap for authentication), window.open() works well in all the cases.\n\nMany thanks for your feedback !"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "markt@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 114376, "time": "2008-03-06T13:15:03Z", "bug_id": 44527, "creation_time": "2008-03-06T13:15:03Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is a 'feature' of how IE implements caching.
