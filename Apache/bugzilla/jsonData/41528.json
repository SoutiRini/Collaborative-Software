The tomcat-native.tar.gz file bundled with \nTomcat 5.5.20 is the version 1.1.3, while the file bundled with Tomcat 6 is \nthe 1.1.8. So, for the moment, I'm using tomcat 5.5.20, but with the library \npackaged with Tomcat 6.\n\nRegards.", "id": 98904, "time": "2007-02-02T05:59:24Z", "creator": "rh3_sp@yahoo.es", "creation_time": "2007-02-02T05:59:24Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 41528, "attachment_id": null, "id": 98906, "time": "2007-02-02T06:16:51Z", "creator": "mturk@apache.org", "creation_time": "2007-02-02T06:16:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is how the things work with versions :)\nThe next Tomcat 5.5 version will include the latest tomcat-native (1.1.8)\nSince we don't provide release version patches (like 5.5.20.XXX) you can\nvery well use the latest tomcat-native (1.1.8) with 5.5.20\nIn fact you will always be able to use any consequitive tomcat-native 1.1.x\nversion. In case API gets broken the tomcat-native version will be incremented\nto 1.2.x\n\nRegards.\n"}]
