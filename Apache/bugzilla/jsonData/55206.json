[{"text": "Created attachment 30555\nPatch to tolerate .svn entries\n\nSome of the webresource tests (org/apache/catalina/webresources/Test*.java) fail when run on a checkout copy due to the presence of .svn directories. They pass when run by buildbot as it does an svn export. This makes verifying a change before submission harder.\n\nAttached patch modifies AbstractTestResourceSet to make it tolerate .svn entries.", "tags": [], "creator": "jboynes@apache.org", "attachment_id": 30555, "count": 0, "id": 168328, "time": "2013-07-06T23:45:50Z", "bug_id": 55206, "creation_time": "2013-07-06T23:45:50Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55206, "is_private": false, "text": "Use a newer version of the svn client.", "id": 168337, "time": "2013-07-07T06:49:19Z", "creator": "markt@apache.org", "creation_time": "2013-07-07T06:49:19Z", "attachment_id": null}]
