This is my first bugzilla report - please let me know if I could have done \nanything better."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "william.barker@wilshire.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 49807, "time": "2003-12-29T19:25:18Z", "bug_id": 25796, "creation_time": "2003-12-29T19:25:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This has already been fixed in the CVS, and will show up in 5.0.17."}]
