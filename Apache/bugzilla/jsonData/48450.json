It is very tedious task to add proper expression extractor to every HTTP request element. I was not able to configure JMeter proxy properly to add parameter extraction automatically.\n\nTo do the task I have updated JMeter code instead (I have attached patch I used). This seems extremely dirty way to do this, but at least it works for me. I think it could be feasible to do something like that in more general way, so some element could be repeated by proxy whenever some text appears in the response. I did not have a time to implement such feature myself, but I though someone could be interested to do it."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 48450, "text": "Niche, maybe would be in a more General Auto Correlate feature which would offer ability to plug extractors/injectors", "id": 188902, "time": "2016-02-27T09:54:37Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2016-02-27T09:54:37Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
