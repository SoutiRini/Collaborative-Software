That is to say, if there is no response returned from peer server, this TCP sampler will be waiting on it for ever.\nBut even I press \"Stop\" or \"Shutdown\" button from JMeter's menu, the blocked TCP sampler can't exit smoothly. I have to kill the process of JMeter or quit JMeter.\nIt's not so convenient. I hope the \"Stop\" button can work to stop the test task even if it's blocking on socket.\nThanks."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 53838, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Only Stop is supposed to interrupt active samplers, however TCPSampler does not currently implement the Interruptible interface.\n\nFixed in SVN:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1382510&view=rev\nLog:\nPressing \"Stop\" does not interrupt the TCP sampler\nBugzilla Id: 53838\n\nModified:\n    jmeter/trunk/src/protocol/tcp/org/apache/jmeter/protocol/tcp/sampler/TCPSampler.java\n    jmeter/trunk/xdocs/changes.xml", "id": 162035, "time": "2012-09-09T14:51:20Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2012-09-09T14:51:20Z", "is_private": false}]
