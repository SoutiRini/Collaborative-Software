Home Page (Uses session data which is stored in cookies)\n3. Logout\nWe have added a HTTP Cookie Manager with 'clear cookies on each iteration' option checked\n\nWith a single user it works fine. When we run the test with 2 users for 5 mins duration with a ramp up of 2 seconds, it throws application error (Null Pointer Exception). Application is saying that session data is missing. Following scenario (based on assumption) is our suspect.\n\n        1. User1 logs in\n        2. User2 logs in\n        3. User 1 & User 2 uses cookies, for session data, in parallel\n        4. User1 logs out\n        5. Jmeter clears the cookies\n        6. User2 tries to use cookies \n        7. Application throws Null Pointer Exception (this is the exception received at application end)\n\nDo we have any work around for this issue? \n\nKindly help. We are running out of time to complete the performance testing activity\n\nRegards\nRanjeeth", "id": 169674, "time": "2013-08-23T17:04:12Z", "creator": "krks_ranjeeth@yahoo.co.in", "creation_time": "2013-08-23T17:04:12Z", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 169680, "time": "2013-08-23T18:33:34Z", "bug_id": 55471, "creation_time": "2013-08-23T18:33:34Z", "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.\nPlease use mailing list for these question.\nIn this case it is not a jmeter bug."}]
