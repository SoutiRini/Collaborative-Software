(diffs?)\n\njk/common/jk_global.h: The #ifndef _OSD_POSIX needs to change to #if\n!defined( _OSD_POSIX ) && !defined( CYGWIN ) in the include section - that\nsys header is not there and not needed\n\njk/buildconf.sh: automake chokes on the -i, but I'm nt sure why yet.\nRemoving it works ok.\n\njk/configure.in: AC_PROG_CC needs to be before the LIBTOOL defs. Works for\ncygwin - don't know if it would break anything else.\n\nWhen finished building, the config.m4 put into the apache build directory is\nmissing the subdirectory name of the static library, so it is unable to find\nit without editing it.\n\n\n---"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 11007, "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 11008 ***", "id": 23210, "time": "2002-09-21T20:49:36Z", "creator": "nacho@apache.org", "creation_time": "2002-09-21T20:49:36Z", "is_private": false}]
