In order to activate such a socache provider you would typically use a directive like\n\n    CacheSocache memcache:localhost:11211\n\nUnfortunately the parsing code for this directive in modules/cache/mod_cache_socache.c is buggy.\n\nIn lines 1264 - 1273 it correctly parses the name of the socache_provider into a variable \"name\" (as the directives argument resides in variable \"arg\" but this can also contain configuration arguments after the colon).\n\nUnfortunately in lines 1275-1276 it tries to verify the existence of the socache_provider against the variable \"arg\" instead of \"name\".\nThe effect of this is, that a directive \"CacheSocache\" without any additional arguments passes this check, but the socache_provider doesn't get any additional configuration values. If you use \"CacheSocache\" with any configuring arguments, the check compares the whole directive's argument against the valid socache_providers and fails.\n\nUsing the variable \"name\" in line 1276 instead of \"arg\" fixes the problem.\n(see attacched patch against rev 1489734.\n\nPlease apologize if this is a duplicate, but I couldn't find this bug reported elsewhere. Also this bug is present in version 2.4.4 as well and I used mod_cache as a components as mod_cache_socache is missing as component.", "id": 167675, "time": "2013-06-05T08:05:51Z", "bug_id": 55062, "creation_time": "2013-06-05T08:05:51Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 55062, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 167765, "time": "2013-06-10T14:12:44Z", "creator": "minfrin@sharp.fm", "creation_time": "2013-06-10T14:12:44Z", "text": "Thanks for catching this.\n\nApplied to httpd-trunk in http://svn.apache.org/r1491458, and proposed for backport to v2.4."}, {"count": 2, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "christophe.jaillet@wanadoo.fr", "is_private": false, "id": 170422, "time": "2013-10-04T20:23:48Z", "bug_id": 55062, "creation_time": "2013-10-04T20:23:48Z", "tags": [], "text": "This is part of 2.4.5\nIt has been backported in r1492202"}]
