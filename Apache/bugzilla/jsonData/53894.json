The \"master\" should be notified. Better to fail fast than to keep waiting for a test finished for the slave that will never come.\n\nWhen starting a test, the slave should report back the start time for the test to the master.\n\nMaster saves the start time in relation to the specific slave.\nSlave saves the start time for later queries from the master.\n\nAfter all slaves have reported back the start time. The master will query each slave for the start time.\n\nIf the start time differs from the first reported or no response is sent back, master should assume that the slave has been restarted or crashed.\n\nIf restarted or crashed, the test should optionally be marked as failed. Atleast the master shouldn't wait for a \"test finished\" from that slave.\n\nHearbeat for a slave should be disabled after test finished has been received.\n\nHearbeat should be optional.\n\n//Nisse"}]
