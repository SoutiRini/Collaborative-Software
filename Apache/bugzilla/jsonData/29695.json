And since those \"free testers\" are not paid, their \"hit rate and\ndescription quality\" may be lower than when paid testers are used.\nBut that (without any apparent effort to reproduce the issue by the\nbug-committer) such a symptom description gets resolved as \"invalid\" appears to\nbe quite alarming - are the bug-committers of the tomcat project interested in\nconstructive(!) feedback at all?\nEspecially if it is in the security domain, it is dangerous to claim a problem\ndoesn't exist just because one doesn't feel like spending time on it. Sure, this\nis not openBSD nor is it a major security hole and thus I didn't expect that\neverybody would jump to fix it, but something that can be reproduced without any\neffort to be declared invalid is very strange.\nSo far, I told my clients: \"and if you use an opensource browser such as\nMozilla, you even get double strength payload encryption!\" - this unfortunately\nno longer holds with tomcat 5.\n\nAs per the issue - I could easily provide screenshots, server.xml files etc. and\n I did ask Remy in a private conversation that unfortunately was never answered:\n<<From: Ralf Hauser [ralfhauser@gmx.ch]\nSent: Sunday, June 20, 2004 2:05 PM\nTo: 'remm@apache.org'\nSubject: Re: Regression in SSL cipher strength\n\nRemy,\n\nI am happy to give you more details.\nIt is really \"ceteris paribus\" - the only change is that I use v4 or v5 of\nTomcat.
