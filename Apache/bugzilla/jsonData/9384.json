[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9384, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Hi,\n\nWe are using FOP (version 0.20.3 from Apache) to generate reports (+/- 15 \npages) in our web application. Sometimes this results in an out of memory error \nwhen doing a 10 user stress test. Whenever this happens, tomcat seems to hang \n(no responses anymore to any of the 10 clients).\n\nIs this a known problem that Tomcat stops responding after an out of memory? Is \nFOP or XSLT or the combination of both possibly causing the problem?\n\nMore detailed description of the situation:\n\nI use Xalan (version 2.2.D14) to convert an XML file to FO (XSLT file is \nincluding some calls to java classes to generate gif files with charts). After \ngenerating the FO file and gif files, the FOP processor transforms it to PDF. \nBoth XSLT and FOP are very memory consuming and after a few hours of stress \ntesting (a few hundreds of generated reports) we get an out of memory error \nsignaled in the tomcat box and tomcat stops responding to all 10 clients. The \nmax. heap size of the Java VM (Sun JDK1.3) is set to 256Mb. We are working on \nWindows 2000 prof. \n\nCan anyone help me with this problem?\n\nRegards,\n\nDominique De Ridder", "id": 16642, "time": "2002-05-24T12:58:00Z", "creator": "d.deridder@customerdialogue.com", "creation_time": "2002-05-24T12:58:00Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 9384, "attachment_id": null, "id": 16654, "time": "2002-05-24T13:55:56Z", "creator": "hgomez@slib.fr", "creation_time": "2002-05-24T13:55:56Z", "is_private": false, "text": "There is known memory leaks in Tomcat 3.2.1, so you should really upgrade to \nTomcat 3.3.1 or Tomcat 4.0.3"}]
