The apache server then sends a HTTP/1.1 request to the\nweblogic server.  It processes the request, then sends back it's reply, along\nwith a Connection: Keep-Alive header.  The apache server then keeps that\nconnection open, but doesn't send any further requests along that connection,\nand doesn't send the reply to the client.  Eventually, the weblogic server kills\nthe idle connection, and apache sends the reply back to the client.\n\n\nIs this the proper way for an http/1.1 proxy to work?", "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 8672, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please try the very latest version of apache from CVS - there were a number of\nenhancements and bugfixes made since v1.3.24, and it's possible that this bug\nyou describe is fixed.\n\nI will close this bug here - please reopen it again if you have problems with\nthe CVS version.\n", "id": 15998, "time": "2002-05-13T12:49:50Z", "creator": "minfrin@sharp.fm", "creation_time": "2002-05-13T12:49:50Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "nd@perlig.de", "text": "No further response ...", "id": 32360, "time": "2003-03-03T19:38:13Z", "bug_id": 8672, "creation_time": "2003-03-03T19:38:13Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
