Please try simplifying the document. The top-level table with only one column simply makes no sense to have around. Just remove it and the document will appear fine in Word.\n\nOf course, it might be possible to improve the RTF output. But unless you do that yourself it's unlikely that anything will happen soon. RTF is a horrible format. Time would be better spent generating OpenDocument if a editable format should be generated.\n\nHTH", "attachment_id": null, "id": 120511, "creator": "jeremias@apache.org", "time": "2008-09-10T03:06:46Z", "bug_id": 45727, "creation_time": "2008-09-10T03:06:46Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "text": "batch transition to closed remaining pre-FOP1.0 resolved bugs", "attachment_id": null, "id": 156730, "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "time": "2012-04-01T13:51:57Z", "bug_id": 45727, "creation_time": "2012-04-01T13:51:57Z", "is_private": false}]
