About 4 weeks ago Tomcat stopped creating a \nnew stdout log everyday and I have no idea why, what changed and most \nimportantly how to fix it.  I spent time talking to Jira support and they said \nit is a problem with apache tomcat.  This is a porblem because Jira makes \nthese huge logs in stdout that need to be deleted.  And because apache is not \ncreating a new log everyday I have to stop it delete the log and then \nrestart.  I don't like having to shutdown Jira every 4-5 days even if its for \na few seconds to delete the log.  \n\nCan you please help me to get tomcat to create a new stdout log everyday?  Do \nyou know how I can stop the massive amount of loging coming from Jira?  It is \nworthless information and Jira support said that there is no way to stop it.  \nMaybe there is something I can do in tomcat.\n\nLet me know if there is any information I can get you about my configuration."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44066, "is_private": false, "id": 111702, "creation_time": "2007-12-12T07:46:44Z", "time": "2007-12-12T07:46:44Z", "creator": "funkman@joedog.org", "text": "Bugzilla is not a support forum.
