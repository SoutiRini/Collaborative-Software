This change makes it possible for the person running the tests from the command line to see the output of the tests *while they are running*.  As you can see from the patch, it writes log messages from the test to the verbose level, so you would only see this output if you add the -verbose option to the command line.  (In practice, it would be better to allow some other command line option to specify whether AntUnit writes the log messages from the tests to the Ant log (not on verbose level) because adding the -verbose option always add so much other stuff to the log.)"}, {"count": 9, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "text": "I must admit I still feel this would be too much in the light of plainlistener, maybe we can do a poll or something like this.", "id": 117749, "time": "2008-06-17T02:41:42Z", "bug_id": 43582, "creation_time": "2008-06-17T02:41:42Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 10, "tags": [], "bug_id": 43582, "attachment_id": null, "id": 174990, "time": "2014-05-02T16:41:25Z", "creator": "bodewig@apache.org", "creation_time": "2014-05-02T16:41:25Z", "is_private": false, "text": "AntUnit 1.3 will ship with a new listener named logforwarder which forwards the log from the project under test to the one running th test.\n\nsvn revision 1591967"}]
