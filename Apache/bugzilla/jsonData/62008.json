Master works in GUI mode and only collects data from other 3.\n\nIf the test runs locally, new folder is created as expected (e.g. 2018-01-17) but if ran in distributed mode, new folder is created with the name ${__groovy(new Date().format('yyyy-MM-dd'))}.\n\nWhat brings me to conclusion that the config element (User Defined Variables) with groovy script is not executed according the the execution order  while ran in distributed mode.\n\nThe script itself has been tested and works fine."}]
