From Jeff's and Eric's posts I see only invites to reach out to the dev@ mailing list to restart the conversation, not a blind deny nor any opposition to preserve a trademark. The httpd development community has a process to decide wether or not a change is needed, and in my experience it has always been open to anybody and very democratic. \n\nSo if you are passioned about the subject and you want to restart the conversation, I do invite you (or anybody else reading) to reach out to the dev@ httpd community with a proposal, but let's all do a good job in keeping bugzilla tasks strictly about important bugs or regressions, there is already tons of work to do and keeping open tasks is not really the best for anybody.\n\nI am going to close again this task as WONTFIX as it is supposed to be, but of course please re-open it if any new decision is taken by the dev@ community."}]
