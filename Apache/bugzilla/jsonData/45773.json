It's also common in such scenarios to use a read-only source repository.\n\nThe sub-build for pcre does not work in this configuration.  The reason is that the build includes a generated source file called \"chartables.c\"  The build process writes that file out to the $(srcdir) and then reads it from there.\n\nChanging the two references to $(srcdir)/chartables.c to $(builddir)chartables.c resolves the problem and allows apache to (again) work in the build scenario described above.  \n\nThis is as simple as editing Makefile.in in srclib/pcre"}]
