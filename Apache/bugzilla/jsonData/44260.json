I can reproduce it on 5 different machines.\n\nExample: Server starts:\nApache/2.0.61 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.0.61 OpenSSL/0.9.8e configured -- resuming normal\noperations\n\nafter first graceful:\n\nApache/2.0.61 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.0.61  configured -- resuming normal operations\n\nafter few more graceful\n\nApache/2.0.61 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.0.61 ion/vnd.wap.wmlc configured -- resuming\nnormal operations\n\nThe string from the log appears within the http header sent to the client which\n seems to confuse firefox once in a while.\n\nWhen I try the same thing with 2.0.59 (compiled and run on the same machine,\ncompiled using the same options), everything goes well."}, {"attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44260, "is_private": false, "count": 1, "id": 112957, "time": "2008-01-17T08:47:18Z", "creator": "takashi.asfbugzilla@tks.st", "creation_time": "2008-01-17T08:47:18Z", "text": "This was already fixed in 2.0.63, which will be available in a few days.\nOr try to apply this patch:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.0.x/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_\nvars.c?r1=571143&r2=575287&view=patch\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 43334 ***"}]
