If the media type remains unknown, the recipient SHOULD treat it as type \"application/octet-stream\".\"\n\nIf my understanding is correct, the header should not be present for simple GET requests without \"entity-body\".\n\n\nJMeter 3.1 behavior:\nGET http://www.google.com/\n\nGET data:\n[no cookies]\n\nRequest Headers:\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\nHost: www.google.com\nUser-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.5.2 (Java/1.8.0_111)\n\n\n\n\nJMeter 3.0 behavior (correct/expected):\nGET http://www.google.com/\n\nGET data:\n[no cookies]\n\nRequest Headers:\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: www.google.com\nUser-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.5.2 (Java/1.8.0_111)"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60579, "is_private": false, "text": "Looks like the same bug in the end.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 60575 ***", "id": 196025, "time": "2017-01-12T14:26:40Z", "creator": "felix.schumacher@internetallee.de", "creation_time": "2017-01-12T14:26:40Z", "attachment_id": null}]
