Instead, it just does a very basic scan through the\n *  file, grabbing all the text records as it goes. It then returns the\n *  text, either as a single string, or as a vector of all the individual\n *  strings.\n * Because of how it works, it will return a lot of \"crud\" text that you \n *  probably didn't want! It will return text from master slides. It will\n *  return duplicate text, and some mangled text (powerpoint files often\n *  have duplicate copies of slide text in them). You don't get any idea\n *  what the text was associated with.\n * Almost everyone will want to use @see PowerPointExtractor instead. There\n *  are only a very small number of cases (eg some performance sensitive\n *  lucene indexers) that would ever want to use this!\n\n\nFile should go in org.apache.poi.hslf.extractor.
