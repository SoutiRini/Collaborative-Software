[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "We noticed during our test programme, that on switching from v2.5.0 to v2.5.1 (to work around another issue), a number of errors started being reported when running our test script against the application.\n\nThe problem appeared to be a result of the ASP.NET session ID cookie being persisted between test iterations. Analysis of the HTTP traffic using Wireshark and Fiddler, confirmed that for SSL requests, the ASP.NET session ID cookie was being persisted across test loop iterations. The cookie was being cleared as expected for non-SSL requests as the test loop iterated.\n\nWe can confirm that setting the property 'https.use.cached.ssl.context=false' has proved to be a successful workaround to the problem. It appears that there is an unexpected interation between the cached SSL context functionality introduced in v2.5.1 and the cookie manager's 'clear cookies on each iteration' functionality.", "is_private": false, "id": 152807, "creation_time": "2012-01-15T18:50:04Z", "time": "2012-01-15T18:50:04Z", "creator": "james.mercer@jxdconsulting.com", "bug_id": 52470, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "is_private": false, "id": 152810, "time": "2012-01-15T21:32:33Z", "bug_id": 52470, "creation_time": "2012-01-15T21:32:33Z", "tags": [], "text": "Can you test this with nightly build:\n- https://builds.apache.org/job/JMeter-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/trunk/dist/\n\n\nSee http://jmeter.apache.org/nightly.html\n for instructions on using it.\n\nWe have fixed issues on this (51919) so maybe your issue is already fixed.\n\nIf you find it is not, please submit a Test Plan and possibly a public facing site and your jmeter.log file."}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 153233, "time": "2012-01-28T16:35:42Z", "bug_id": 52470, "creation_time": "2012-01-28T16:35:42Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I am not able to reproduce your issue neither in 2.5.1 nor in trunk.\nCould you submit a Test Plan to give us more details about the problem.\n\n\nThank you"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 52470, "attachment_id": null, "id": 153669, "time": "2012-02-10T14:44:34Z", "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "creation_time": "2012-02-10T14:44:34Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I close issue as no anwser.\nFeel free to reopen with more details."}]
