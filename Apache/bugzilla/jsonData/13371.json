There is no easy way to do this.  I want to be able to pick all \nfiles between certain tags or from a particular date, for example.\n\nCvsTagDiff goes partway there but just produces a list of candidate files. \n\nMy task 'CvsExportDiff' fills the gap.  It internally calls CvsTagDiff and then \ninvokes 'cvs export' to extract candidate files of a particular revision; it \nthen provides the files in a directory for later tar'ing, etc.\n\nI am contributing the source code and documentation.  I hope others will find \nthis useful."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 13371, "attachment_id": 3378, "id": 24084, "time": "2002-10-07T17:23:51Z", "creator": "andrew.liles@starfishzone.com", "creation_time": "2002-10-07T17:23:51Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 3378\nThe source code"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "andrew.liles@starfishzone.com", "attachment_id": 3379, "id": 24085, "time": "2002-10-07T17:24:25Z", "bug_id": 13371, "creation_time": "2002-10-07T17:24:25Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 3379\nThe manuel page"}]
