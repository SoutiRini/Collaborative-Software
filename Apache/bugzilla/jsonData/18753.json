So i assume, the\nproblem is in isapi_redirector2.dll\nWhen uploading files >10k the Uploaded stream seems to be corrupted. The\nMultipart-Parser (oreilly) complains about an \"unexpected end of part\".\nSometimes the connection will only be halted, so that tomcat waits in upload\nuntil timout is reached.\n\nIf this was the wrong place to put my request, i apologize. \n\nThx Hans-Peter"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "whp@uboot.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 35066, "time": "2003-04-12T19:56:55Z", "bug_id": 18753, "creation_time": "2003-04-12T19:56:55Z", "is_private": false, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 15278 ***"}]
