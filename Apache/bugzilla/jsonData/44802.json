I have started out on the JMeter user ML mostly to get help with .jmx Samplers and Listeners and the usual sort of problems involved with learning JMeter as a user for testing and monitoring purposes. Notwithstanding, I have compiled the CVS trunk source (20080408). As a result I discovered a very nice feature enhancement suggested in the Comments in the Monitor Results Listener (MonitorHealthVisualizer.java). At the top of the class file: MonitorHealthVisualizer.java  it is stated: <In the future, we may want to add email alerts as a third tab>. Cutting to the chase I took the liberty of implementing the MailerVisualizer functionality as a JSplitPane and added it to the Monitor Results Listener. I have a .PNG screen-shot of the result. I have done no testing. I would like feedback on whether the Mailer Alerts tabbed pane looks as it should and if this is acceptable. If this is acceptable  I would like to complete the testing and learn what I need to do to get the source contributed to the JMeter project. Please find attached the screen-shot described above. Please advise, David."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 21810\nMonitorHealthVisualizer.java 3rd tabbed pane enhancement\n\nThis is a screen-shot of the results of deploying the MailerVisualizer.java functionality as the 3rd tabbed pane in the MonitorHealthVisualizer.java (Monitor Results Listener).", "attachment_id": 21810, "id": 115516, "creator": "david@davidwbrown.name", "time": "2008-04-10T12:57:46Z", "bug_id": 44802, "creation_time": "2008-04-10T12:57:46Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44802, "text": "*** Bug 44791 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "id": 115518, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-04-10T13:08:18Z", "time": "2008-04-10T13:08:18Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 44802, "attachment_id": null, "text": "Please don't assign bugs.", "id": 124491, "time": "2009-01-29T10:54:29Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-01-29T10:54:29Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 188665, "time": "2016-02-21T22:13:48Z", "bug_id": 44802, "creation_time": "2016-02-21T22:13:48Z", "is_private": false, "text": "There are better ways nowadays to monitor a Tomcat.\nWe have lot of work on JMeter so closing this one as WONTFIX"}]
