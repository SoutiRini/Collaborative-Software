Which made the behavior I saw mind boggling.\n\nI tried fumbling around with the flags, accidently making it accept the proxy\nconfiguration parameters (which I didn't know of course), but then JMeter\nstumbled on a non proxy server on port 8080 after which the intelligent behavior\nkicked in afgain and sent it via a direct route.", "id": 70061, "time": "2005-01-25T11:42:57Z", "bug_id": 33232, "creation_time": "2005-01-25T11:42:57Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 33232, "text": "-H and -P should be OK with or without the spaces - not sure why you are seeing\nthis behaviour, as these options should behave the same as -t, which does allow\na space.\n\nDid you use any other parameters before the -H and -P?\n[Perhaps the CLI parser got confused]\n\n==\n\nAs far as I can see, the -H and -P options are merely used to set the system\nproperties htts[s].proxy[Port|Host]\n\nSo any \"intelligent\" proxy behaviour is presumably a feature of the http\nimplementation - which I suppose may vary between suppliers.\n\nThe server uses the default protocol handler from the Java installation.", "id": 71289, "time": "2005-02-21T01:36:13Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-02-21T01:36:13Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 33232, "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 71880, "time": "2005-03-06T14:34:22Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2005-03-06T14:34:22Z", "text": "Could not reproduce.\n\nAlso CLI parser has been replaced with updated version."}]
