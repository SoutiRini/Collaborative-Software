I only see a documentation issue here as this limitation is not mentioned in the docs, maybe because to most Unix people it is known that passwords encrypted with crypt do not support more then 8 characters and are truncated after 8 characters.\n\n> In addition:\n> The man page Examples states that the htpasswd use Apache md5 by default.

The below text states explicitly and clearly that md5 is only default on Windows and crypt will be used on other systems.\n\n> \"EXAMPLES\n>              htpasswd /usr/local/etc/apache/.htpasswd-users jsmith\n> \n>        Adds or modifies the password for user jsmith.

I think this is now fairly closed down to a documentation improvement regarding the 8 character limit of crypt.\n\n2. The login to the Bugzilla site here (I assume you talk about the Bugzilla site).
