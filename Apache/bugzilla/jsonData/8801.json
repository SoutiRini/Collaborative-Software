Saving can be done at the node level; I have been\ncaught by this at least once).\n\nAs well, there are probably _many_ places where the test plan\nshould be set to dirty - but only the 'Save' can clear this\n(even 'Load'-ing a new test plan might only add to the test plan).\nHave I understood this correctly ? It doesn't seem to be possible\nto change test plans without closing down and restarting JMeter.\n\nAs a side note, would a ThreadGroup be a candidate ?
