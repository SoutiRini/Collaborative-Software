[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Hi,\n\nwith the 2.3 the behavior of the balancer module changed. in 2.2, as far as a\nbalance-member did't response, he was set into error-state.. but now, he tries\nfor a long time.. of course now, i chnaged the timeout to \"1\", so he only tries\nfor one second, and then tries the next one.. BUT: now, with a bigger\nbalancer-set (i have one with 15 members) he first tries this 15 members, and\nthe switchs to the 'spare one' [or error-code if not set], and of course, this\nhappens ever \"retry=xx\" second.. so if half of the server's didn't response, i\nget long answers for nothing.. \n\nsecondly, there is still this problem, that the \"<Proxy balancer://xyz>\" has to\nbe set in the virtual host-part IF YOU WANT to use the STICKY Session. This is a\nmess, because i have lots of balancers, and therfore one file where all them are\nconfigured. An include in the general section works for 'standard-balncing', but\nfor using sticky-session, i have to include this file in every\nvirtual-host-section.. :-(\n\nThanks for help\ndominik", "is_private": false, "bug_id": 41764, "id": 100049, "time": "2007-03-05T06:49:54Z", "creator": "apache@friibii.ch", "creation_time": "2007-03-05T06:49:54Z", "attachment_id": null}]
