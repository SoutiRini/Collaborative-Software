CR/LF is short for Carriage Return/Line Feed, the standard end of line \nindicator.  This option can be useful when a TAR file contains text files \ncreated on a Unix or Macintosh machine.  Unix text files usually contain lines \nending in Line Feed characters only, and Macintosh text files usually contain \nlines ending in a Carriage Return character.  The standard Windows Notepad \nprogram and many other Windows programs require a Carriage Return and Line Feed \nat the end of each line.  When the TAR File smart CR/LF conversion option is in \neffect, WinZip determines whether to perform CR/LF conversion for each file \ninside a TAR file by looking at the first 80 characters in each file.  If the \nfile is a text file then single LF and CR characters are converted to CR/LF \npairs so the file can be viewed by Notepad and other Windows viewers.  Files \nare considered text when the first 80 bytes contain only characters with ASCII \nvalues between 0x20 and 0x7f, carriage returns, line feeds, form feeds, tabs, \nand other alphanumeric characters (as determined by the Windows \nIsCharAlphaNumeric API).\n"}]
