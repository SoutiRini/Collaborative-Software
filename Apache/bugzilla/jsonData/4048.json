When it \ngets a good login, it does not know where to send the user.\n\nI thought this was a problem with the security model, but we are not seeing \nthis issue on Weblogic. It pains me so to see weblogic functioning 'better' \nthan Tomcat.\n\nCan the security servlet forward to index.html or index.jsp if the url is null?"}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "cmanolache@yahoo.com", "attachment_id": null, "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 1861 ***", "id": 6645, "time": "2001-10-12T13:05:11Z", "bug_id": 4048, "creation_time": "2001-10-12T13:05:11Z", "is_private": false}]
