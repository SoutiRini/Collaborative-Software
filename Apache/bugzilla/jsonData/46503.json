The workers can be edited to remove these characters and the problem doesn't seem to return, but it worries me because that data had to come from somewhere... perhaps there's another problem happening because of an under/overflow into that field."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 46503, "is_private": false, "text": "I see the same garbage characters on the jkstatus page in the domain and redirect columns with mod_jk 1.2.27 and 1.2.28.
