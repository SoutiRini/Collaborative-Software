[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "Created attachment 22894\nLog file containing errors while tomcat starts\n\nI have been using Apache Tomcat 5.5.23 with Java 1.5.0_12. OS is Windown Server 2003. Tomcat connects to an Informix database and I have been using this application at my company without any major issues so far for more than 2 years. Lately we noticed some suspicious activities reported by Symantec and there seems to be some phony user ids being created under Local Users and Groups. Soon after the response from the Tomcat application seems to be pretty slow. I use jsp and jdbc to connect to the Informix database and there is nothing too complex about that. I have attached a log file of the errors I am getting while trying to start Tomcat.\nIt would be great as we are apprehensive that it is a security breach as the application starts fine every time. My development servers that have same configuration and connecting to the same Informix Database are running fine. Please help at the earliest as the application is critical to the company.
