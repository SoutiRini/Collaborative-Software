Apache is \ninstalled and running fine. Tomcat has been installed, and I can serve up \nservlets and jsp's fine from the localhost:8080 port. \n\nA Blue Screen of Death occurs sometime after when I go to access a servlet/jsp \nfrom the apache http port. My webserver runs on port 81. I have configured the \nwarpConnector to recognize the /examples/ directory properly. I know this works \nbecause I can at least get to the /examples/ directory and sometimes when I'm \nlucky, open an html file from here successfully. Also, when I start \nTomcat/Catalina, I do not see any errors in the Catalina logs, and see the \nwarpConnector being initialized properly with no errors.\n\nThe BSOD will occur usually when I have the /examples/jsp/index.html page \nloaded and go to click on one of the JSP links. At that time, my NT machine \nwill issue the BSOD with the error code MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS. \n\nI have been able to successfully get the BSOD everytime I go to access a JSP \nfrom the actual website URL on port 81 rather then localhost:8080.\n\nFor obvious reasons, I am keeping Tomcat/Catalina off. But my website \nwww.4thharmonics.com is always up running apache. The DNS will redirect you to \nport 81 with an IP forwarding service I have.\n\nThank you for your help. I really would like to fix this problem, but have come \nto wits end about what to do. Any help is much appreciated."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "bojan@binarix.com", "attachment_id": null, "id": 14165, "time": "2002-04-21T08:31:10Z", "bug_id": 8337, "creation_time": "2002-04-21T08:31:10Z", "is_private": false, "text": "This is not a bug in Tomcat.
