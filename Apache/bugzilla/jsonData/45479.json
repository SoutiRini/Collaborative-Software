If so, log a warning and overwrite with the new HeaderManager.\n\nNEW:\nThe HeaderManager object now supports a merge(..) operation, allowing it\nto merge its values with another HeaderManager's.  The result is a new\nHeaderManager object with values from both -> with more local-scoped\nvalues take precedence over more distant-scoped values.  So, when\nHTTPSamplerBase.setHeaderManager(..) detects a more locally scoped\nHeaderManager already assigned, it stores the merged result.\n\nI created one new interface \"TestMergeable\", anticipating that this\ncould also be useful for other config elements, such as HTTP Cookie Manager.\n\nThe attached .diff is based on current SVN trunk (as of 2008-07-23 @\n20:00:00 EDT).", "is_private": false, "id": 119000, "creation_time": "2008-07-24T16:15:11Z", "time": "2008-07-24T16:15:11Z", "creator": "andrew.alsup@logsec.com", "bug_id": 45479, "attachment_id": 22314}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 45479, "attachment_id": null, "id": 121161, "time": "2008-10-02T12:52:53Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2008-10-02T12:52:53Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Thanks for the patch, applied to SVN trunk:\n\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701225&view=rev\nLog:\nBug 45479 - Support for multiple HTTP Header Manager nodes\n\n\nI did not use the TestMergeable interface.\nThe merge() method in HeaderManager cannot return a HeaderManager - the compiler complains that it is not compatible with TestMergeable. Also, the interface is not used by HttpSamplerBase."}]
