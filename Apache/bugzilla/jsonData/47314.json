This leads to memory issues when a document is made of one big page sequence, that can't be easily broken down into several smaller ones.\n\nBen Wuest has submitted a patch against FOP 0.95 that allows to 'join' page sequences together i.e., suppress the page break that must occur between them. That allows to make the document look like it had been made of only one page sequence, without the memory issues mentioned above. The PDF and RTF renderers have been adapted accordingly.\n\nSee discussion here: http://markmail.org/thread/mfafprg4xtownmw4", "id": 127630, "time": "2009-06-04T03:14:56Z", "bug_id": 47314, "creation_time": "2009-06-04T03:14:56Z", "attachment_id": 23757}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "is_private": false, "id": 157303, "time": "2012-04-07T01:41:22Z", "bug_id": 47314, "creation_time": "2012-04-07T01:41:22Z", "tags": [], "text": "resetting P2 open bugs to P3 pending further review"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "id": 157837, "time": "2012-04-11T03:20:18Z", "bug_id": 47314, "creation_time": "2012-04-11T03:20:18Z", "is_private": false, "text": "increase priority for bugs with a patch"}]
