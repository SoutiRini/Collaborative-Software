Values are either \nof the form \"TYPE\" or \"TYPE;charset=CHARSET\" with an optional white space after \nthe \";\". CHARSET, if present, must be the IANA value for a character encoding.\nTYPE is a MIME type, see the IANA registry for useful values.\nThe default value for TYPE is \"text/html\" for JSP Pages in standard syntax, \nor \"text/xml\" for JSP Documents in XML syntax. If CHARSET is not specified, but \nthe page encoding for the JSP page is specified, CHARSET defaults to the \nspecified page encoding. Otherwise, if neither CHARSET nor the page encoding \nfor the JSP page is specified, the default value for CHARSET is ISO-8859-1 for \nJSP Pages in standard syntax, or UTF-8 for JSP Pages in XML syntax.\nSee Chapter 3 for complete details on character encodings. \"\n\ncheckResponseXML.jsp should be checking for 'UTF-8' instead of 'ISO-8859-1' as \nthe response character encoding."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "Ryan.Lubke@Sun.COM", "attachment_id": null, "id": 19763, "time": "2002-07-18T12:37:53Z", "bug_id": 10333, "creation_time": "2002-07-18T12:37:53Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Test has been corrected."}]
