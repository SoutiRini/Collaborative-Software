The problem is, AFAICS, that the javascript \nmagic in Blah has changed since I wrote the bot.  The original blah had a \n\"create baz\" link of the form:\n\njavascript:__doPostBack('lnkCreateBaz','')\n\nNow it is:\n\njavascript:__doPostBack('FooOrgAdministratorLeftMenu1$CreateFooLinkButton','')\n\nSince the interface to the engine has changed, blahbot is no longer able \nto talk to the blah server.  The real problem here is that a hidden form \nis filled out using javascript -- the first argument is the \"event target\" \nand needs to be rewritten with ':' for each '$' then saved in the form. \nFor example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nif ($key eq \"__EVENTTARGET\")\n{\n     my $et = 'FooOrgAdministratorLeftMenu1$CreateFooLinkButton';\n     $et =~ s/\\$/:/g;\n     $form->{$key} = $eg;\n}\"\n\nEnd of quote\n\nAnother example, this time taken from an article online:\n\n\"The format of the ViewState is issued t o the browser in literal \ncharacters. There are numerous encoded values in t h e ViewState , each \ndelimited by \u201c+\u201d . The server, however , expects to receive the ViewState \nback with special characters replaced w i t h their ASCI I equivalent . The \nonly special character that is observed to be dynamic in the ViewState string \nis the delimiter \u201c + \u201d , represented in a post body or URL query string as \n\u201c%2B\u201d .\n\nThus, before the captured ViewState can be successfully used, each of these \n\u201c+\u201d symbols that are interspersed in the string must be substituted with \n\u201c%2B\u201d . This can be reformatted by passing the value obtained by t h e \u201c LOAD\nRESPONSE_INFO\u201d command t o a subroutine held in an \u201c Include\u201d file.\""}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 38576, "text": "Nothing concrete to fix", "id": 126885, "time": "2009-05-08T18:09:49Z", "creator": "sebb@apache.org", "creation_time": "2009-05-08T18:09:49Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
