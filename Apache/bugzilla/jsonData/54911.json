[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "text": "With httpd setup as a reverse proxy in front of a backend Tomcat instance, Tomcat can set the Server reply header by adding the \"server\" attribute to its HTTP Connector. I.e., \n\n<Connector acceptCount=\"100\"\n           connectionTimeout=\"20000\"\n           executor=\"tomcatThreadPool\"\n           maxKeepAliveRequests=\"15\"\n           server=\"myBackendServer\"\n           port=\"8080\"\n           protocol=\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol\"\n           redirectPort=\"8443\"/>\n\nWhen examining the reply headers from httpd, I can see that this header is set. This seems to go against the spec (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt), section 14.38 where I see:\n\n14.38 Server\n\n   The Server response-header field contains information about the\n   software used by the origin server to handle the request. The field\n   can contain multiple product tokens (section 3.8) and comments\n   identifying the server and any significant subproducts. The product\n   tokens are listed in order of their significance for identifying the\n   application.\n\n       Server         = \"Server\" \":\" 1*( product | comment )\n\n   Example:\n\n       Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17\n\n   If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy\n   application MUST NOT modify the Server response-header. Instead, it\n   SHOULD include a Via field (as described in section 14.45).\n\nAssuming that this would be addressed at some point so that the Server as set by the backend server is not included in the reply from the httpd reverse proxy, it would be nice if the backend values could be recorded before they are munged in mod_proxy so that they could be added to the access log via some new mod_log_config format, e.g. %{field}z.", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 54911, "id": 166976, "time": "2013-04-30T17:50:13Z", "creator": "ppickett@vmware.com", "creation_time": "2013-04-30T17:50:13Z", "is_private": false}]
