Please let us know your thoughts and if any changes are appropriate we'll be happy to make them and propose a revised patch.\n\nThe patch series being proposed here is also available on the master branch of this repository:\n\n  https://github.com/traviscross/apr/\n\nAuthor: Anthony Minessale <anthm@freeswitch.org>\nDate:   Thu Mar 13 21:38:35 2014 +0500\n\n    Return the tag from apr_pool_tag()\n    \n    This allows the function to be used as an accessor when passed a NULL\n    tag.  This is useful for e.g. debugging printf's.\n    \n    Signed-off-by: Anthony Minessale <anthm@freeswitch.org>\n    Signed-off-by: Travis Cross <tc@traviscross.com>", "time": "2014-09-10T18:50:08Z", "creator": "tc+asf@travislists.com", "creation_time": "2014-09-10T18:50:08Z", "is_private": false}]
