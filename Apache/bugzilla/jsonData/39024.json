The current implementation is missing three public methods\nexposed by log4j 1.2's DOMConfigurator: \n\nvoid configurationAndWatch(String);\nvoid configurationAndWatch(String, long);\nvoid doConfigure(Reader, LoggerRepository);\n\nIn addition, any DOMConfiguration extensions are highly likely to be broken due\nto the change of the internal structure.  While less common than extended RFA's,\nextensions of DOMConfigurator are likely to exist and should be supported. \nGiven the radical difference in the DOMConfigurator and JoranConfigurator\nimplementation, porting the log4j 1.2 DOMConfigurator forward would seem the\nreasonable approach.  Though like the o.a.l.RFA's, DOMConfigurator would be\nmarked as deprecated and could be placed in a log4j-obsolete.jar."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "creator": "carnold@apache.org", "attachment_id": null, "is_private": false, "id": 106548, "time": "2007-08-09T14:53:38Z", "bug_id": 39024, "creation_time": "2007-08-09T14:53:38Z", "text": "log4j 1.3 development has been suspended and further work on compatibility is not expected."}]
