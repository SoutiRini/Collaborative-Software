The problem is that taskdef tasks can't find the ant-contrib classes.  I've tried calling project.setCoreLoader(ClassLoader), and I've also tried setting the thread's context class loader.  Nothing works.  I looked in the code, and the root of the problem seems to be on line 335 of Project.java (in version 1.7.1, anyway).  The createClassLoader(Path) method uses the Project class's class loader rather than the core class loader for the parent."}]
