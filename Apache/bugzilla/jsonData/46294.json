I have attached the test FO to this bug.\n\nThe problem is that the list-body within this FO use body-start() function to control indentation of body, but label is dependent on list-item indentation, since label start-indent is not set. \n\nThe spec defines the body-start() function based on the indentation of list-block and doesn't take the indentation of list-item into account. Therefore the correct result should be an overlapping label and body with the attached FO. However, the PDF Renderer doesn't overlap the label and body, neither does it indent the nested labels or bodies."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "bowditch_chris@hotmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 122843, "time": "2008-11-25T09:10:54Z", "bug_id": 46294, "creation_time": "2008-11-25T09:10:54Z", "tags": [], "text": "Just spotted a typo in the bug description.
