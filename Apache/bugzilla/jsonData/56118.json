However, if I enable the timer the the first upload request works but the second fails, then the third works, and the forth fails, etc...\n\nThe only difference is enabling and disabling the timer.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't actually give you a working jmx - the attached will always fail but hopefully it is still useful.\n\nFailure is:\norg.apache.http.NoHttpResponseException: The target server failed to respond\n\nSuccess:\n204 - blank response\n\n\nThe type of timer makes no difference.\n\nThe value in the timer DOES make a difference. 100ms and + = problem, 30ms = no problem.\n\nThe request I am making to S3 is valid, were it not I would get an error response. In this case I get NoHTTPResponse."}, {"count": 1, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "p.mouawad@ubik-ingenierie.com", "text": "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 56119 ***", "id": 172952, "time": "2014-02-08T17:56:39Z", "bug_id": 56118, "creation_time": "2014-02-08T17:56:39Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}]
