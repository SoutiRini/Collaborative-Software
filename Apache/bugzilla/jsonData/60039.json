This generic error page contains the exception's stacktrace which is great for debugging and development.\n\nThis does of course not happen when appropriate <error-page>s have been defined in the web app's deployment descriptor.\n\nBut in my scenario we do have lots of webapps. Some of them specify an error-page for HTTP Status 500, some don't. So sometimes it happens that stacktraces are sent to the client.\n\nFrom perspective of administration the easiest possibility to avoid this would to have a configuration option which tells the generic error page whether to include details about the exception or instead just contains a generic error message like \"Sorry. An internal server error occurred ...\"\n\nWouldn't it be useful to have such a configuration option?\nWhat do you guys think?", "id": 193310, "time": "2016-08-24T13:59:16Z", "creator": "saschakarcher@gmx.de", "creation_time": "2016-08-24T13:59:16Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 60039, "text": "Hi,\n\nThere is such configuration.\n\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/config/valve.html#Error_Report_Valve\n- showReport\n- showServerInfo\n\nRegards,\nVioleta", "id": 193311, "time": "2016-08-24T14:21:08Z", "creator": "violetagg@apache.org", "creation_time": "2016-08-24T14:21:08Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}]
