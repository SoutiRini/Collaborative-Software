[{"count": 0, "tags": [], "bug_id": 59160, "text": "The scp task doesnot handle ipv6 ip as hostname. The problem is in Scp class. The method parseUri is wrongly extracting the ip address based on first appearance of \":\" after @ . But in IPv6 it is having more than one \":\" in the ip address.\n\nExample \n\nFor ip fd01:0:101:2608:0:11ff:fe42:e13c the scp task gets the hostname as fd01 as the host name is parsed based on the index of \":\" after \"@\". It should use lastIndexOf the \":\" uri to get the proper hostname to support ipv6\n\nThe current implementation is :\n\n int indexOfPath = uri.indexOf(':', indexOfAt + 1);\n        if(indexOfPath == -1)\n        {\n            throw new BuildException((new StringBuilder()).append(\"no remote path in \").append(uri).toString());\n        }\n        setHost(uri.substring(indexOfAt + 1, indexOfPath));\n\n\nThe fix for bug :\n\nint indexOfPath = uri.lastIndexOf(':');\n     if (indexOfPath == -1) {\n       throw new BuildException(\"no remote path in \" + uri);\n   }\n   \n   setHost(uri.substring(indexOfAt + 1, indexOfPath));", "id": 189337, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "sauravezee@gmail.com", "creation_time": "2016-03-10T13:00:51Z", "time": "2016-03-10T13:00:51Z", "is_private": false}]
