I\nselected Workflow/submit then Workflow/publish, and now the LIVE view shows the\ntwo links.\nBack to authoring, as of today (revision 307273) I found it impossible to edit\nthe files with both KUPU and BXE (see:\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36298 and\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36973). I finally managed to\nmodify the file by pointing the XP DAV client at\nhttp://localhost:8888/default/authoring/doctypes , copying the file to my HD,\nediting with notepad (I added a third link), then copying it back to DAV repo.\nI must say that in previous revision the built-in editors worked to some extent,\nbut the final result I'm going to describe was the same.\n\nNow I can see the modified document in the authoring view, but the 'Submit' menu\nis disabled under 'Workflow'. I tried 'Publish' (which forces 'publish complete\nsubtree' if used without a prior Submit). It finished without errors, but the\nLIVE section always shows the original page.\n\nIf I switch to the 'revisions' tab on the 'SITE' view, I see 'current version'\nand 'rollback to this version - view' with the same timestamp. I'd expect the\nprevious version to have a different timestamp. And actually, if I click on\n'View' of the previous version, it shows the new one. Apparently it detected a\nchange in the file, but failed in keeping the previous version.\n\nCan anyone confirm I'm not drunk, and that what I tried is actually supposed to\nwork?", "id": 80923, "time": "2005-10-08T12:27:07Z", "bug_id": 36974, "creation_time": "2005-10-08T12:27:07Z", "is_private": false}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36974, "attachment_id": null, "id": 84979, "time": "2006-01-25T09:58:19Z", "creator": "andreas@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-01-25T09:58:19Z", "is_private": false, "text": "I can't confirm the problem (LCR 371588).\nWould you mind trying again after an SVN update?"}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36974, "text": "Do these problems still occur?", "id": 90164, "time": "2006-06-13T22:28:32Z", "creator": "andreas@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-06-13T22:28:32Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "bug_id": 36974, "text": "No answer - please reopen if this still occurs.", "id": 92401, "time": "2006-08-22T11:27:33Z", "creator": "andreas@apache.org", "creation_time": "2006-08-22T11:27:33Z", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null}, {"count": 4, "tags": [], "text": "Not all of the remarks are still valid, but the fundamental problem remains.\n\nIt's not possible to edit and publish a document a second time.\n\nIf you don't trust my word, please try on\nhttp://lenya.zones.apache.org:9999/default/\n\nTry publishing a page and then editing and publishing again.
