The first thing we need to apply is version configurability of the PDF document. This patch allows the user to add \"<version>1.5</version>\" as a child of <renderer mime=\"application/pdf\">. This allows PDF versions to be specified between 1.4-1.7.\n\nThis patch ONLY allows the header of a PDF to be configurable. I should emphasise that it only allows the header specifying the PDF version can be configured."}, {"count": 1, "tags": [], "bug_id": 51385, "attachment_id": null, "id": 147193, "creation_time": "2011-06-16T14:05:41Z", "time": "2011-06-16T14:05:41Z", "creator": "gadams@apache.org", "text": "See also my implementation of such an extension as well as additional features as described in:\n\nhttp://marc.info/?l=fop-user&m=130017885816296&w=2\n\nRegards,\nGlenn Adams", "is_private": false}, {"count": 2, "tags": [], "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 27164, "id": 147200, "time": "2011-06-16T16:03:16Z", "bug_id": 51385, "creation_time": "2011-06-16T16:03:16Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 27164\ncorrected some mistakes\n\nCorrected a few mistakes:\nInvalidParameterException --> IllegalArgumentException\njavadoc in PDFRenderingUtil\nAdded VersionTestCase to the TestSuite"}, {"count": 3, "tags": [], "creator": "med1985@gmail.com", "attachment_id": 27253, "id": 147737, "time": "2011-07-05T08:00:27Z", "bug_id": 51385, "creation_time": "2011-07-05T08:00:27Z", "is_private": false, "text": "Created attachment 27253\nDynamic PDF versioning support\n\nThis version allows dynamic versioning such the \"<version>\" tag enforces a static PDF version (in the header), however, the lack of said tag will use the PDF in the PDF image.

If any version is specified in the config file, then that version will not be allowed to increase.\n\nOn the other hand, if I want to enable 1.5-specific features like the upcoming object streams, I would want to set the version to 1.5 and still expect it to increase as necessary to handle PDF images.\n\nThat said, we may also want this parameter to mean that a certain renderer, with a certain feature set, must be selected, if for example we need to maintain backwards compatibility with downstream products. So in that case we /would/ want the version to be fixed.\n\nAll that doesn't really matter as long as we don't use the PDF Images plug-in. So, in order to allow things to still change in that area, I've removed any mention to dynamic configuration and the plug-in.\n\nThanks,\nVincent"}]
