Basically, it looks like your web server is\nexpecting encoding with ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, and the browsers are\ncomplying.  JMeter expects UTF-8 (which is supposedly the standard).  The\nproblem is that browsers don't send what encoding they are using with each\nrequest - it seems they simply reciprocate based on what encodings the server\nsends back.\n\nI can't fix this easily without changing a lot of code and putting some\ncleverness into the proxy server.
