This is very inconvenient, because the only way to get those values otherwise (for example, if we want to pass them to the backend listener) is to use a JSR223 post-processor from an HTTP sampler (otherwise, the CookieManager is not available) and do one of three suboptimal things:\n\n1. Import o.a.j.p.h.c.Cookie/CookieManager and loop iterate over the cookies by index. (Notably, doesn't work if the cookie value is variable.)\n\n2. Use regular-expression hacks on the output of CookieManager.getCookieHeaderForURL() to extract the value.\n\n3. Import the correct HttpClient CookieHandler and iterate over the list returned from CookieHandler.getCookiesForUrl().\n\nThe CookieManager should make the _current value_ of a cookie available at all times when that property is set.", "id": 198283, "time": "2017-04-13T16:59:36Z", "creator": "jepp@cas.org", "creation_time": "2017-04-13T16:59:36Z", "is_private": false}]
