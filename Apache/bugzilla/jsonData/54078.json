Even if the problem it's easy to reproduce it could be a waste of time or problematic for production environments.\n\nThis is a proof of concept. I used an appender, maybe there are better options. Current implementation uses a couple of hacks to make the configuration as easy as possible.\nA lot of obvious features are missing (filters for trigger events, etc.).\n\n\nI'm starting to use this in a stage/production environment to check its effectiveness.", "id": 163072, "time": "2012-10-30T21:34:21Z", "bug_id": 54078, "creation_time": "2012-10-30T21:34:21Z", "is_private": false}]
