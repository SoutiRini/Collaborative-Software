\section{Introduction}

\boldification{Since Git came out in 2008, distributed software development has taken a new turn. Collaboration and Coordination became the heart of development. }

\boldification{We look at the various ways research enhanced collaborative development, the birth of git, CI, CD, Travis CI.}

\boldification{But these developments came with their own banes. They added to some of the existing problems of collaborative development which remain unsolved. }

\boldification{In this paper we reflect on the journey of collaborative distributive development, the ups and the downs, to evaluate where we are today.}

\boldification{We ask: what problems still exist in collaborative development? What new problems are emerging due to the advancements in distributed development?}

\boldification{ We investigate whether these problems caused industry to grow away from research today. Numerous empirical studies revealed that developers scream for aid in regards to collaborative development. So why does industry not look into the problem? }

\boldification{In order to find answers, we perform 3 types of investigation. We look at last 10 years of academic research papers published in the top 3 conferences, 2 surveys conducted and @IFTEkhar about the data part }
